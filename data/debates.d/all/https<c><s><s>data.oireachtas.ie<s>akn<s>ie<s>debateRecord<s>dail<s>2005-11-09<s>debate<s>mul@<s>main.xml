        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Taoiseach and his Ministers are prone to answering questions about rip-off with a sense of denial, but I would like to raise a particular issue. My colleague, Deputy Stanton, has conducted extensive research on the cost of disability equipment here compared to in the United Kingdom. His survey shows that people with disabilities, the Health Service Executive and the taxpayer here pay on average more than 40% higher prices for disability equipment, and in one case more than 100%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Deputy Stanton's survey looked at 19 basic items that serve disabled people in their daily lives, including mobility equipment, toiletry aids, safety grab rails etc. He found on average that prices here are 40% higher than in the United Kingdom. Five items were over 50% more expensive. For example, the memory foam cushion is €137.83 in UK prices, but €275 in Ireland, a differential of approximately 100%. The prop-up bed wedge used by disabled people is €20.94 in Britain, but €38.30 in Ireland, a differential of over 83%. The grab rail, which is an important aid for disabled people, is €11.54 in England and €17.50 here, over 52% of a price differential. Two very important items are the stair lift and the four-wheel scooter. The 16-step stair lift is €1,400 in the United Kingdom but there is a differential of €611.83 here. The four-wheel scooter is over €770 dearer here.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">These differentials illustrate that the taxpayer, the HSE and, most importantly, disabled persons are ripped off by prices of items essential for their daily comfort and convenience. Should there not be a review of these prices by the Competition Authority? Will the Taoiseach instruct it to carry out such a review and investigation to ensure these mini cartels are broken up and that the taxpayer, the HSE and disabled persons get fair treatment across the board and are not ripped off in this manner?</p>
        </speech>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I do not have details on the prices, but if those differentials are as Deputy Kenny states, they are excessive. From the Government perspective, this is an issue for the Competition Authority and it should already be examining it. This may be an issue partly as a result of the significant resources we are now putting into the disability area.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_7">Some €643 million has been invested into support services for people with disabilities in the past few years. It would be regrettable if investment in the health boards, now the HSE, and resources for additional places, equipment and voluntary agencies resulted in excessive prices because of the extra money and opportunity to sell equipment. Deputy Kenny makes the point that the Competition Authority should examine this area. If agencies or a limited number of people are purchasing, it should conduct an examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The Rehabilitation Institute, the Central Remedial Clinic and the other organisations purchase directly and in many cases have the opportunity to buy in multiples. One would imagine they would pass the equipment on to individuals as would the HSE in its various regions. It would be interesting to see how their prices compare with those mentioned by Deputy Kenny. I do not know, but the information should be easily found.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The issues raised by Deputy Stanton in his survey are not theoretical. These items were all priced in late August or early September of this year. The differentials call into question public procurement policy. Does this sort of rip-off apply throughout the public procurement system where other materials are required for various categories of people? Why is this not being investigated?</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Some 18 months ago, the post-polio support group brought this issue to the attention of the Department of Health and Children. That Department was happy to announce it would investigate it, but nothing has happened.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_14">The Department went on to say the information provided by the post-polio support group would be very helpful in that regard. However, we have examples of 19 pieces of equipment, priced in late August and September of this year, where the average differential in price is over 40%, and up to 100% in some cases. When we talk to people who must sit in wheelchairs and conduct their lives as best they can, we find they are being ripped off. However, the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and the Government are not investigating why this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Will the Taoiseach tell us that he will ask the Competition Authority to investigate this rip-off system? If we apply the difference in prices spent on mobility equipment here, it means that over the past number of years over €40 million has been paid out, €16 million of which could have been used for extra benefits and facilities. It is clear that a rip-off is occurring in this area. The Taoiseach is being advised by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, who has said the idea that rip-offs are taking place in the tourism sector is a myth.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">The relatively new Act that established the Competition Authority gives the authority significant powers to examine any possible cartel in any sector of the economy. I do not know whether the authority is examining the matter raised by the Deputy. I am aware, however, that every cent the State spends on disability services needs to be categorised by the relevant Department. That is being done, as Members are aware. I will raise the issues mentioned by Deputy Kenny. If such abuse is taking place in a vulnerable sector of society, I agree it should be investigated. Perhaps it is already being looked at. I will outline my concerns in this regard. The Government has invested €2.8 billion in disability-specific services in recent years.</p>

Now that we have invested our resources in this vulnerable sector of Irish life, we are getting value for money. If some people in the sector are involved in abuses, the matter should be examined. I repeat the point I made earlier — the vast majority of people with disabilities are covered by medical cards. A great deal of the equipment they need is purchased through the Health Service Executive in the regions and also through a host of other excellent organisations like Rehab and the Central Remedial Clinic.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">Does that mean the Taoiseach and the Government are contemplating the acceptance of the Labour Party's child care policy? The Taoiseach is aware that just one person in ten believes child care is affordable. Some 84% of those who responded to the survey in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> believe the Government has failed to address the issue of child care. The average cost of keeping a child in crèche care is €724 which, depending on one’s tax circumstances, is equivalent at a minimum to €1,065 per month, or €13,000 per annum. Many people are spending more on child care than on their mortgages. This is a fundamental aspect of the debate about the nature of family life and society. Nine out of ten people believe the Government has failed to deal adequately with child care issues. Does the Taoiseach intend to take action of the nature proposed in the Labour Party document? Does he intend to respond to the suggestion that parental leave be increased? Does he intend to make provision for preschool education? Bearing in mind that many couples are working in one and a half jobs, does the Taoiseach intend to underline by legislative measures the right to flexible part-time working? Child care is one of the biggest issues faced by society and many of the electorate. Given the amount of taxes people are paying and the extent of the Government’s budget surplus, the electorate wants to know the nature of the Government’s response.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">Deputy Rabbitte is right to state that child care is a big issue. It is a big issue because 2 million people are working in our strong economy, which has grown over recent years. The number of women in the workforce has increased from 400,000 a decade ago to 800,000. It is estimated that approximately 220,000 people need child care facilities. The Government increased child benefit payments from €38 to €141 at the last budget. The overall child care budget increased from €500 million to €2 billion. Some €499 million has been invested under the equal opportunities child care programme to provide over 30,000 child care places. I accept child care is still a big issue that needs to be dealt with, however. The Government has examined all the child care reports. Deputy Rabbitte will not mind me saying that the Labour Party's child care document is very similar to the National Economic and Social Council's document on the same issue — it is almost word perfect.</p>

I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that child care is a major and significant issue. I do not believe that every single proposal that has been made by every group can be accepted at once. I have noted that many of the organisations have said we need to build on the successes which have been achieved over recent years. Most people acknowledge achievements such as the considerable increase from €38 to €141. I accept that some people are paying as much, if not more, on child care as on their mortgages. I do not deny that it is a huge drain on such people's resources. The Government is considering what it can do about this problem, which cannot be totally resolved in one go. The Government trebled child care payments in a single budget by implementing a huge increase of €32.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">The Government decided to increase child benefit because agreement could not be reached the last time the matter was examined comprehensively by the various groups. The Government was faced with a decision when there was total disagreement among the main organisations. It decided that changes in the child benefit system represented the best way of making progress. Having listened carefully to the organisations in question on this occasion, the Government is trying to make some further improvements. That some 220,000 people have child care needs is a major issue. I acknowledge that the Government has to try to make progress. The Government has succeeded in providing 30,000 child care places in not-for-profit community crèches under the equal opportunities child care programme. It has completed what it set out to do, which was to treble child benefit, so now it needs to try to do something else.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">The Taoiseach has agreed that child care is a big issue. I accept his comment that it is impossible to put in place a perfect child care system overnight, given the absence of a decent system up to now. Having listened to the Taoiseach's response, however, it is unclear what the Government proposes to do. He said, for example, there are 2 million people in the workforce. Is the Taoiseach implying he will forget about the women — they tend to be women in the main — who are forced out of work because of the cost of child care or who make the choice to leave the workplace to look after their children for a period? Does he plan any legislative measures to address the question of flexible working and the right of the spouse, whichever one it is, to go back into the workforce? The Taoiseach does not appear to have thought about that and he appears to be confusing child care with child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Talking about confusion and NESC, I thought it was at Cavan that we had NESC, not at Clonmel. The Taoiseach can include NESC as part of the hegemony he has established over various quangos. I do not know what he learned in Cavan but from what I can see it was not very much. What is the Taoiseach's position on improving parental leave and pre-school education and does he plan to give any kind of legislative underpinning to the right of people to take up part-time work or to leave work for a period? On the question of stay-at-home spouses, does he intend to grant equal treatment for them in whatever measures are introduced for people at work?</p>

          <p eId="para_67">In this case I am talking about people in the workforce. Some 800,000 people are now working. The reason the Government decided to go the child benefit route the last time was that there was no agreement by the representative organisations as to how this could be done both for people who were in the workforce and for those working in the home. For that reason the Government decided the fairest way was to move from child benefit of €38 to the current rate of €141 which was an enormous increase. I will not go into the history of how small increases were in the past but we gave an enormous increase in child benefit from €500 million to €2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">Child benefit is child care. It is money to help people whether they are working in the home or outside of it. I do not think one can discriminate between people working at home and those in the workplaces. It would be putting one against the other and that would be the wrong thing to do. We have already improved parental leave. A number of initiatives are in place in my Department to support the needs of a diverse workforce, including work sharing options, flexi-time, career breaks, paternity leave, term leave, special leave for domestic circumstances, adoptive leave and carer's leave. All of these are in operation in my Department. I support them all and their extension. I agree with whatever helps a person to pursue his or her career in a proper way.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Under the equal opportunities child care scheme we have gone from a position of zero to a network of community non-profit crèches. These have got both capital and costs of up to €499 million to provide 26,000 child care places — at maximum capacity there will be 38,000 or 39,000 places. All of these things are necessary. Officials across Departments have looked at all the best models, which are considered to be in Finland and Sweden. Finland appears to come out No. 1 in Europe. We have looked at the models to see what we could achieve over a number of years now that we have improved child benefit. I would like if we could move to deal with some of these issues. Seven issues have been identified and the interdepartmental group has suggested that we should pursue one or two of them. We are looking at those to see what we can do to at least get the process started.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">There has been widespread media coverage as a result of Deputy Catherine Murphy and I raising with the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the recent phenomenon of management companies in new housing estates and the fees demanded by them. Many media commentators have said they were not aware of this new form of rip-off. The words, "scam", "rip-off" and "stealth tax" were correctly and frequently used in recent days with regard to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The Minister is seeking information but I want two or three very clear statements from the Taoiseach this morning in regard to the policy aspect of the matter. Does he oppose the sneaky underhand privatisation by local authorities through the management company structure of services such as care of public open spaces, public liability insurance, maintenance of the water pipe network and other services, not inside apartment blocks but in housing estates, and the effective imposition of a new local tax on new young home buyers to finance this? In the Taoiseach's estate and in mine and probably in the estates of most Members, those services are provided from our general taxation through the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Does the Taoiseach oppose the scam whereby house builders, having made obscene profits already, control the management companies for the first four and five years and drag the very people who made profits for them into the courts to force fees out of them to finance basic maintenance which they were obliged to do by law up until now and are still obliged to do? It is dishonest in the extreme to say people have a choice, as some local authority managers have attempted to say in justification. They do not have a choice any more than a starving person in a queue for food has a choice as to the conditions that will be imposed on him or her. Sharp practice is in operation when, for example, an 18-page contract is being shoved under people's noses when they come to sign for their houses to force them into a management company.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Yesterday. we had the reassuring image of the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, posing like Robert De Niro looming over the mean streets of Dublin assuring us he would help us to plan for Christmas. Admittedly, that was offset by the terrifying image of the Minister for Defence this morning at the controls of an Army helicopter.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">What the Taoiseach said is very interesting. The follow up must be that legislation would be introduced immediately to allow the voiding of the contracts into which people have been forced already so that the management companies can be dissolved and those services can then be provided by the local authorities. The Taoiseach has a personal listening post in the form of a media watch group paid for by the taxpayer. The day before yesterday, the "Liveline" programme was chock-a-block with revelations from all over the country about the extent of this new scam. Apparently, it could have gone on for another few hours such is the extent of it. I and Independent Deputies have made, and will continue to make, this a major issue. If it is not resolved quickly, it will be a major election issue in key areas. I will talk to other parties as well. I have constituents who will be in court in the next few weeks. They have been scandalously dragged there by the developers to pay these fees. I am glad the Taoiseach agrees with the point but what can he say concretely about stopping the practice instantly, dissolving the companies which exist and about the provision of those services from the general taxation which applies to most of us already?</p>

          <p eId="para_92">As Deputy Joe Higgins knows, legislation in any area cannot be applied retrospectively and it would be wrong to give any comfort to people knowing that to be the case. In many areas, management companies which were originally set up to take care of and maintain complexes and to look after environmental issues, such as landscaping, cleaning, painting and so on, have extended their services to include those which in any other estate, whether in a public, private, corporation or council area, would normally be free. They have designed contracts to place total liability on tenants who, particularly some years ago when there was a supply and demand issue, signed these contracts. Tenants now find the costs are excessive and that they are arbitrarily increased annually. This places a huge burden on people. It is a fairly new phenomenon and it did not happen in the past. The Minister has stated he is examining the issue but it cannot be dealt with retrospectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">As the Taoiseach will know, the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002 was initiated in 2002 but it has still not been enacted. I wish to make a suggestion regarding the North-South civic consultative forum provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. Would it be possible to deal with this issue by way of an amendment to the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill? There is no reason the National Economic and Social Development Office should not take on that responsibility as well. It would be a quick way to deal with something to which we all gave allegiance in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

I do not know how much work has been done but I will check to see if that could be done. I have no objections. As I said before, the fact this Bill has not been passed is not a huge difficulty but it is important in the long term in that it relates to people's pension rights and other issues. I would like the Bill to be passed, although I accept it is not an urgent matter. Perhaps I will consider that to see if it can be done. If it can be done, I would have no problem with it.</p>

We had the Order for Second Stage of the 28th Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2005, which was a prerequisite for a referendum. Will the Taoiseach indicate if that legislation will be brought forward in the future or is it in abeyance? Does it depend on factors outside his control or can he indicate if he has a date in mind?</p>
            <p eId="para_103">We discussed North-South bodies earlier and the Taoiseach said he would consider the obstacles, as he saw them, in the way of the register for persons considered unsafe to work with children legislation. Has he had an opportunity to do so? Will it be possible to overcome those obstacles given that in the North, a different view seems to have been taken, namely, that it is possible to continue and not to be held up by the lack of institutions there? Has there been progress on that issue?</p>

A review and an examination is taking place everywhere. I welcome what is happening here where many debates and discussions are taking place at different levels. Many politicians have been involved in some of the debates and discussions I attended, which is good. The more extensive the debate throughout the winter and spring, the better.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">The Austrian Presidency next June will report on where to go. However, I do not believe the French or the Dutch will make announcements on this in the short term. The Dutch are very adamant that they will not return to this in the lifetime of their current government. No one has contradicted that. The French face a slightly different debate. They have other debates with which to contend. I do not believe this issue will come up before the French presidential election so I do not see it arising in the lifetime of this Dáil.</p>

There is now a majority of 13 or 14 countries and all the indications are that another three or four will definitely move. We are moving to a position where we are down to the last five or six next year. The Austrian Presidency might say the others should go ahead with the exception of the two. In that case, we would proceed. However, I do not believe that is likely to happen. I believe people will wait until after the French presidential election but perhaps they will change their minds over the next nine months or so.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">Will the Taoiseach bring forward legislation to provide for any constitutional changes in the remainder of the current Dáil? For instance, in the area of Seanad reform, many reports have been presented recommending specific changes in the arrangements for the election to and operation of the House within the Oireachtas. Will the Government bring forward a package of constitutional changes? Will the Taoiseach consider the introduction of a list system for Seanad elections, thus providing access for the electorate throughout the island of Ireland and the Irish diaspora, both of which have been argued for by a variety of sources through the years? What is his view on those matters?</p>
            <p eId="para_112">The Government's White Paper on Regulatory Reform contains a list of actions relating to the legislative process. I have raised this with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and, recently, during the Order of Business on a question regarding the heads of a Bill he encouraged me to table a parliamentary question. I did so and, lo and behold, I was contacted and clarification was requested regarding what the question meant. I still have not received a reply to it and I wonder whether the Taoiseach can give me the information now. This has been flagged by him on many occasions. How many times have the draft heads been circulated in advance of a Bill's publication? I accept it can only be done where it is feasible and appropriate but how many times has that facility, which the Taoiseach heralded, been availed of and provided?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_113">I would not rule out constitutional change on issues that are, perhaps, non-constitutional and where referenda are necessary. That could happen at any time following a judgment of the High Court or Supreme Court. There is none currently. Issues have arisen from the various reports of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which are being examined by various Departments, and they could result in constitutional referenda. A referendum is not planned but a number of issues are under consideration arising directly from the reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">On Seanad reform, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is chairing a group. I am not sure where it is at but a parliamentary question to the Minister would be appropriate. Seanad reform is being examined on the basis of the comprehensive report the Seanad itself produced. The House appointed a good group which worked through most of the summer two years ago to produce that report and this is being used as the basis for discussion as well as some of the suggestions and proposals we made about extending membership and making Northern representation permanent. That matter is being examined again. I have no other view outside those views.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">With regard to the publication of the heads of a Bill and the regulatory impact analysis, it was suggested it would be a good idea to circulate the heads of a Bill in more areas, though perhaps not all, to generate discussion and to allow interest groups, whether they comprise social partners or others, to make a submission. It is not something new. This has been done over the years in many Departments. It is a good practice but some Departments do not share that view. It is a way of speeding up the process. However, legislation is always better when one consults. Perhaps that is my view because I spent much of my ministerial career in the Department of Labour. I did not invent it but the basis of doing business in that Department was to discuss the heads of a Bill with employers and trade unions which gave them an input and improved the legislation. Perhaps that cannot be done in every area but a number of Ministers are doing it. I welcome that because it is a good way to give people an input. It is not possible when a Bill is put through the House quickly but many Bills take two or three years at least before they get through the system. The publication of the heads of Bills is part of policy and the regulatory impact analysis. It was not previously but the process has become formalised and there is more compulsion on people to do it.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The Forum on Europe played an important role in the run up the last number of referenda. Given that it is unlikely a referendum on the so-called EU constitution will be held during the remainder of the lifetime of this Administration, what is the future of the forum? Does the Taoiseach expect it to meet on a number of occasions over the next 12 months or whatever? I agree with him that it is unlikely the French or the Dutch will go back to the constitution. Does he envisage a scenario where the non-contentious elements of the document will <i>de facto</i> be implemented, given that a number of them could be under way? Could the EU Heads of Government say, “The following are non-contentious and let us implement them and get on with it”?</p>
            <p eId="para_117">In reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Taoiseach stated he does not have any views outside the report prepared by the Seanad itself regarding its reform. However, it is important that the diaspora should be represented in the Oireachtas. A number of detailed discussions on motions and Private Members' Bills took place on this issue in the 1980s but it did not prove practical to implement a measure in this regard. Jim Higgins, MEP, offered to hand over his Seanad seat to an agreed appointee of the diaspora movement from Britain or wherever. That offer is still on the table and in view of the——</p>

            <p eId="para_122">There is every reason for the Forum on Europe to continue its work. I welcome the communicating Europe initiative by the European Commission under which more commissioners and other senior officials will make themselves available to governments. The Forum on Europe is the best way to support dialogue and discussion of the issues and the forum's reports tease them out. The forum was established because that was not happening. Admittedly, it was a Labour Party proposal, which I took up, but it was a good one. We should continue to develop the forum and I would love it see it receive more media attention because there have been some excellent debates, which have almost gone unnoticed. That is a pity because there has been high quality debate about national questions and issues such as how the role of the Defence Forces will evolve and change and battlegroups. These issues have been well debated at the forum and consensus must be built on them. Next year, three or four commissioners, as well as the President of Commission, will attend the forum. The President will attend again because he thought it was a useful exercise. Since he visited during the summer, he has advocated that his commissioners and representatives of other member states should attend the forum. That meeting received a great deal of coverage but we could generate coverage of many of the other meetings. Deputy Joe Higgins will be delighted to know that Commissioner McCreevy will attend the forum to see him.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">That will be another good day in the forum. The sad thing about the constitutional document is that the chairman of the convention insisted on it remaining as it was. A number of us warned that publishing and explaining an enormous document with annexes was fraught with danger, in view of the relatively simple case of explaining the Nice referendum. The French insisted on the framework as the way to do it. One could take all the institutional sections which would maintain the balance of how the constitution was negotiated. One could not take some sections of the document and have these approved but one could leave out the annexes and make progress. This must be examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">With the addition of Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria, some 28 countries could be EU member states. Other discussions are taking place, including discussions with a lobby group for the accession of the Ukraine, which is inevitable over the next few years. In addition, at least three or four countries in the Balkans will come on to the map over the next three or four years. On the current institutions and qualified majority voting we cannot continue without reform so it is advisable to examine this matter. This will form part of the debate next summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">Regarding the Seanad, the difficulties in the 1980s still exist and it is a matter for the Seanad to discuss. I am not ruling out consideration of what the MEP from Deputy Kenny's party proposed. How would one define an electorate? I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposal where the Federation of Irish Societies would nominate someone. This could be pursued in discussion. I was involved in these discussions as Whip in the 1980s and it proved impossible to establish a basis of an electorate in the United States and the United Kingdom, without considering the wider Irish diaspora.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">Deputy Stagg does not ask me too many questions. At his behest, I raised this matter last year with the RTE authority and discussed the matter with it when I opened the new offices in Millbank, in the United Kingdom. The members of the authority raised two issues, the cost and the legislative element. I understand the legislative matters can be resolved in the broadcasting Bill. This leaves the cost issue and I understand the Minister and his officials would rather deal with this in the context of the entire broadcasting Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">I am aware of Deputy Stagg's interest in this matter and would share it from a different perspective. From a sporting point of view I think broadcasting to Britain would be a good thing. Deputy Stagg's proposal is good — perhaps he is looking at it from the perspective of cultural and other issues. A large audience of Irish people in the United Kingdom would be interested in Irish radio and particularly in sport during the summertime. It would be valued if people could get far better reception and if it can be done I will support this measure. I will speak to the Minister again on this issue if it does not cost an arm and a leg. Many people are listening to games and other cultural events, with which I am not familiar, on the Internet but this is not the easiest way of doing this.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">The Cabinet committee on social inclusion and the Cabinet committee on children last met on 5 October 2005. The next meeting of both committees is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">I chair both the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and the Cabinet committee on children. Their membership includes the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Ministers for Education and Science; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Finance; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Social and Family Affairs; and the Ministers of State with special responsibility for children; housing and urban renewal; drugs strategy and community affairs; and equality issues, including disability issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">It strikes me there are more people on the sub-committee than in the Cabinet. In view of recent experiences in this area, is there an argument for reorganisation of Departments so a single Department focusses on needs of children in all respects as responsibilities for these needs is currently scattered across several Departments? The experience of successive Ministers of State is that they have been fighting an uphill struggle to focus on the needs of children.</p>

            <p eId="para_161">The National Children's Office co-ordinates aspects of various Departments and that is probably as good as one can make it. I am not saying that cannot be improved upon because everything can always be improved through more input. Neither I nor the Minister think the idea of a separate Department for children is worthwhile because one cannot take children out of the education or health sectors. Therefore, if there was a separate Department for children, one would still be dealing with health and education aspects through the relevant Departments. I certainly agree with making the role more powerful but the current Minister has such a role, as did the previous one. It is important to build the National Children's Office which can co-ordinate work across Departments. To do otherwise, through the establishment of a Department of children, would not be meaningful.</p>

Has the Taoiseach put before that committee the report of the National Economic and Social Forum on child care and early childhood education? Will the Taoiseach ask the Cabinet committee on children to consider the need for child care and early childhood education to be the special preserve of a single ministry in the future? Will the committee consider such a proposal rather than the current situation whereby issues relating to children are scattered across a raft of different Departments?</p>
            <p eId="para_163">When Members ask questions relating to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs they are often referred to the line Minister. Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a member of the committee on social inclusion and drugs? If the Minister is a member of that committee he should accord Members of this House the courtesy of a response when questions are put to him on the specific area of drug abuse, rather than resorting to the diatribe of abuse he directs at my Sinn Féin colleagues.</p>

            <p eId="para_166">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a member of that committee, which deals with all social inclusion issues across a range of Departments. Obviously, child care and related issues are discussed at that committee. As I said in reply to Deputy Rabbitte, children's issues are being dealt with by the National Children's Office. As is obvious from recent issues, the equal opportunity programmes involve both the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children. Cabinet committees operate on the basis of achieving interdepartmental co-operation on matters that are not specific to any one Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_168">As I said to Deputy Rabbitte, I do not think it is workable because one cannot take the child from the family or remove children from the health and education sectors. Rather than have a duplication of effort, it is better to co-ordinate such efforts. Specific issues can be dealt with by the Minister for Health and Children, but one cannot duplicate the entire effort. When necessary, the Minister for Health and Children can co-ordinate people from various Departments, which is a more efficient way of dealing with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_169">In addition to examining whether lessons can be learned or future mistakes avoided, will the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs take stock, given the result of the French referendum on the EU constitution, of the problems in France where rioting has occurred for the past 13 nights? Some 1,200 people are in custody in France, many of them on the basis of social exclusion as they would see it. Perhaps the committee needs to meet more often, given that its social inclusion remit does not appear to be fulfilled, particularly as one quarter of Irish children remain at risk of poverty according to CORI and the ESRI.</p>

            <p eId="para_203">A significant part of the Central Statistics Office is already located in Cork. Some 48 staff from my Department have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme. The breakdown by grade is: assistant principal, seven; higher executive officer, five; administrative officer, ten; executive officer, 12; staff officer, three; and clerical officer, 11.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">Arrangements are in place to ensure the decentralisation of these staff does not impact negatively on the quality of the services provided by the Department. These arrangements include the phased redeployment of some of the remaining staff to the areas of the Department most affected by decentralisation and the provision of training and job profiles/work manuals to new staff, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">The fact that nearly 20% of the staff of the Department have opted to relocate outside Dublin shows the underlying decision to initiate a comprehensive decentralisation programme was correct.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_306">I want to pay tribute to those who came forward to speak to the inquiry outlining the appalling abuse they suffered. These courageous people who spoke about their experiences of abuse have offered the inquiry and the country as a whole a disturbing but crucial insight into the nature and extent of the problem and the lasting trauma it can cause. We need to remember that the events which occurred in Ferns have affected the families of victims and those against whom allegations were made and I hope in this debate that the feelings of these are taken into account. I also pay tribute to Mr. Justice Murphy and his team on the tremendous work they carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The Government and country are appalled, shocked and dismayed at the extent of the allegations of abuse outlined in the Ferns Report. Our duty as a Government and a nation is to ensure that proper child protection practices are in place and operate to the highest achievable standards. This Government has accepted all of the recommendations in the Ferns Report. In view of this, I have taken a number of steps to ensure the recommendations are implemented by all the bodies concerned and by the wider community. I have requested confirmation from the Irish Bishops' Conference that the recommendations of the Ferns Report will be implemented collectively and individually by its members. I have also requested confirmation that the framework guidelines are in place in all dioceses.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is finalising proposals for the establishment of a commission to investigate the handling of complaints and allegations of child sexual abuse against clergy operating under the aegis of the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin. It is proposed that the commission may investigate the situation in any Catholic diocese in the State following a notification from my office that the diocese may not be implementing church guidelines on child sexual abuse by a priest or religious or a notification that a diocese may not be implementing satisfactorily the recommendations of the Ferns Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Health Service Executive has been requested by me to make contact with the individual bishops in the Catholic Church as a matter of urgency to monitor child protection practices and ensure compliance with the recommendations of the Ferns Report.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">It is being prepared for circulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">It is my intention to request the commission to verify compliance with the recommendations of the report after the necessary approaches and discussions have taken place between the HSE and the bishops at local level. I have also requested the HSE to launch a nationwide publicity and awareness campaign on child sexual abuse. The National Children's Office will assist the HSE in ensuring the campaign effectively targets and is relevant to children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I welcome the statement by the church authorities that they intend to introduce the interagency review group, as well as the current Ferns model in all areas of the country. I have requested the HSE to convene meetings of this group and to record and maintain its records in line with the inquiries' recommendations. The HSE is to report as soon as possible after initial meetings with the bishops have been held and liaison arrangements have been put in place. The Archbishop of Armagh has written to me with an undertaking to co-operate in every possible way with the recommendations of the Ferns Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Government has accepted, in principle, the recommendations of the report, including a crucial recommendation on the powers of the HSE with regard to third party child sex abuse. I am supportive of the proposals contained in the report and have requested my officials to liaise with the Attorney General with a view to preparing an indepth legal study and concrete proposals on foot of the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I have already announced a national review of compliance with the Children First guidelines by State bodies and non-governmental organisations which will be driven by the National Children's Office in partnership with all relevant Departments. The Children First guidelines were published in 1999 and, in light of recent events, it is essential the Government can stand over its own procedures for the protection of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">A number of recommendations contained in the Ferns Report fall within the specific responsibilities of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The report recommends that the legislature should consider the introduction of a new criminal offence with regard to engaging in conduct that creates a substantive risk of bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child or failing to take reasonable steps to alleviate such a risk. The Minister will bring forward appropriate amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill to deal with this recommendation. The report recommends that legal aid, irrespective of means, be available to both complainants and priests against whom allegations are made where the cases are not determined by the criminal courts. The Minister is examining legal aid provisions with a view to giving effect to this recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The report recommends that certain documents relating to child sexual abuse should be given legal privilege. This recommendation will be examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The report contains a number of recommendations with regard to Garda procedures. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has forwarded a copy of the report to the Garda Commissioner, who will be considering it and taking on board its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Responsibility for services for the care and protection of children rests with the Health Service Executive. The services available to children who are victims of sexual assault, and their parents, include professional services such as medical and nursing, social work, child and adolescent psychiatry, clinical psychology and family support services. With regard to adults who, as children, suffered abuse, the national counselling service is now well established throughout the country and is in a position to make every assistance available.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">In 1998 a working group to review the child abuse guidelines was established to prepare revised guidelines aimed at improving the identification, investigation and management of child abuse. The membership of this group was wide ranging and included representatives of Departments, the Garda Síochána, the HSE, universities, trade unions, hospitals and non-governmental bodies. The revised guidelines, Children First -National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, were published in 1999. Approximately €9.5 million has been provided for the implementation of these guidelines. The HSE has used this additional funding to create the infrastructure necessary to support full implementation of the guidelines. This has included the appointment of implementation officers, training officers, information and advice officers as well as additional social work and administrative staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The first Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, was appointed by the President in December 2003. She was appointed following an innovative recruitment process involving children and young people in all aspects of the process, from job description to selection. The main functions of the Ombudsman's office are to deal with complaints by and on behalf of children and to promote the rights and welfare of young people. The Ombudsman for Children also has a function, set down in legislation, to advise any Minister on the development and co-ordination of policy relating to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">A draft White Paper on mandatory reporting of child abuse was prepared in 2000 and was circulated to Departments. There have been significant developments since the preparation of the White Paper, for example, investment in the implementation of the Children First guidelines and child protection services generally by the HSE, appointment of advice officers in the HSE, the introduction of the Children First child protection guidelines in education, sporting and other sectors and so forth. It can be argued the Children First guidelines have, to some extent, addressed the problems which gave rise to the calls for mandatory reporting and that the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 has allayed fears of people of being sued.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In view of the comments and observations made and the consultations with the Attorney General's Office, it was clear there were very complex legal issues on the subject of mandatory reporting which required further consideration. The commitment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce a new criminal offence where any person "wantonly or recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child or wantonly or recklessly fails to take reasonable steps to alleviate such risk where there is a duty to act" is a very positive development. It should help to achieve an increased awareness of the personal responsibility that all people, not only professionals, have to protect children at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The Ferns Report has reopened the debate on mandatory reporting. I would like to see a culture of mandatory reporting being established, but not on a legislative basis. I believe that people are now more readily prepared to report concerns around child abuse to the relevant authorities and to pursue those authorities to ensure the complaint is dealt with effectively and efficiently. I do not see the advantage of criminalising a person for keeping his or her word to an individual who does not want the complaint to be taken any further. Enough damage has already been done to such individuals without them being concerned that the person they have entrusted with this information could be the subject of criminal proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">To enable the expansion of vetting services, additional human resources have been secured for the Garda central vetting unit. Specifically, sanction was obtained last year for an additional 17 staff which will increase total staffing to 30. As part of the Government's decentralisation programme, the Garda central vetting unit has recently been decentralised to Thurles, County Tipperary, from where it will expand its operations from current levels on a phased basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The implementation group on Garda vetting continues to progress implementation of the recommendations of the report of the working group on Garda vetting. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda Síochána's vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers and others working with children. The implementation group has yet to agree the exact sequence of the phased roll-out of the expanded service but will meet again on 13 December 2005. The report of the working group has been published on the website of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The issue of vetting of people who volunteer in the education sector also has to be considered in this context. The Department of Education and Science's view is that the determining factor in deciding whether such persons should be vetted is the extent to which they have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults. In consultation with the education partners, this issue will be examined closely as the Garda vetting service expands.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The working group on Garda vetting recommended the introduction of specific legislation to provide for various aspects of vetting, including the release of soft information, indemnification against disclosure, and the maintenance of a national criminal records system by the Garda Síochána. It recommended minor amendments to the Protection of Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, to offer protection for persons reporting the abuse of vulnerable adults and not just the abuse of children and to the Sex Offenders Act 2001, to require a convicted sex offender to inform a prospective employer of a conviction when applying for a position involving unsupervised access to the physically disabled and not just children or the mentally impaired. These proposals are being considered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The working group also recommended that the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children should explore the possibility of the development of non-Garda, employment-related vetting registers to provide information on those previously dismissed, suspended, moved or made redundant from posts for harming children or vulnerable adults in the health and education sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">While priority is being given to the extension of the Garda vetting services, discussions on proposals for legislation to establish a non-Garda, employment-related vetting register are ongoing between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The legislation is intended to establish a non-Garda employment-related vetting register for persons considered unsafe to work with children, a framework of liaison between the relevant bodies in the health, justice and education spheres and to facilitate co-operation with the agencies responsible for the maintenance of similar registers in the United Kingdom. The register, similar to the pre-employment consultancy system, PECS, in Northern Ireland, would provide information on those previously dismissed, suspended, moved or made redundant from posts for harming children or vulnerable adults. However, as is clear from the working group's report on Garda vetting, there are complex legal issues involved in this jurisdiction, particularly with regard to the release of so-called softer information, such as allegations and complaints. Legislation which will provide appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals will need to be carefully worked out, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The practical recommendations of the Garda working group are being brought forward by an implementation group, chaired by the Garda Síochána and comprising representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and Mr. Paul Gilligan, chief executive officer of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Obviously, the Ferns Report has had a major effect on the country as a whole. My job and that of the Government and the Oireachtas is to protect those within our country who cannot protect themselves. This is also the job of our local communities and our entire society. In the past there have been shortcomings in the system. However, with the measures I have announced arising from the Ferns Report and the developments that have occurred under successive Governments over the past 15 years we have gone a long way to protecting our children. Nonetheless, we cannot be complacent and must continually strive to put in place better safeguards to ensure the levels of abuse outlined in the Ferns Report can never happen again. In addition, in the words of the Ferns Inquiry, it is essential that "there will be mechanisms and procedures in place which will enable victims promptly to report the abuse in the confidence that they would be believed and the certainty that appropriate action would be taken to terminate the wrongdoing". It is the duty of the Government to ensure proper child protection practices are in place and in operation. This is a key element of the objectives that must be met to ensure the shocking and appalling events described in the Ferns Report are addressed fully and, as far as is humanly possible, prevented from happening in the future.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_334">I wish to preface my remarks with a word of support for those priests who have done no wrong. They deserve our support and sympathy at this difficult time. The majority of priests are living out their Christian message in an exemplary fashion and have our support at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">It is difficult to overstate the importance of this report, produced by Mr. Justice Frank Murphy and his colleagues. It is a landmark document in the context of child sexual abuse — abuse which was compounded in its gravity because the actors were members of one of the most trusted groups in our society. The victims, children of all ages, suffered not only the most awful forms of sexual, physical and psychological abuse at the hands of clergy but also suffered the silence, betrayal and inaction on the part of the church who placed the protection of the most vulnerable below the church's priority of protecting themselves and the church. Child protection came last.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I heard a chilling description of what these abusive clergy did to their victims as the equivalent of eating their souls and destroying their souls. Unlike other forms of ill-treatment, sexual abuse of children by priests, and the subsequent disbelief of their stories if they have the courage to speak out, is uniquely destructive of the individual spirit of a person, that inner place or core. Given the scale and brutality outlined in the report, it is truly remarkable, indeed awesome, to witness the human capacity to heal and even forgive among some victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">This report, however, is a landmark in another respect. I hope it will change forever the special relationship that has existed for many decades between church and State. This report must be the starting point for the State's response to all contained in it. But this new beginning cannot happen unless the old relationship ends. The unrelenting deference, which constituted the relations between church and State, must end. It was given for many decades and expected for many decades. This special deference and relationship was extremely influential in terms of outcome, and it must end. Only then can the State act as it should, which is objectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The systemic failure outlined in the report means nothing less is acceptable. If the church leadership, the hierarchy, was a cabinet, it would resign <i>en masse</i> or be thrown out of office. However, the church is neither democratic nor accountable. In many ways it is a secret organisation, with its own diplomatic service, civil service, laws and self-regulatory codes, which have all failed the public. Because the church in Ireland was the main interface with God, the Irish people and the State have shown deference personally and collectively over many decades. This veil of deference is the root cause of society’s failure to stop the church’s systemic maladministration and dereliction of duty to protect children as outlined in the report. Because what happened in one diocese is just a microcosm of the situation in all diocese, the findings are damning in their import. The fact is there have been hundreds of crimes of clerical abuse against children which went unpunished. Priests were transferred instead of being exposed. Priests with a propensity to offend were ordained, appointed to curacies, and bishops colluded and covered up these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The mighty church has fallen from grace because of its failure to protect children. The first response of the State must be to state unequivocally that the special relationship is no more and to take steps to demonstrate that disconnect between State and church. From now on, with that veil of deference removed, the State can deal with the church authorities in the same way as it would with any other voluntary or State agency that provides services for children and families. This means no longer accepting the bona fides or the good offices of an admittedly remorseful hierarchy after the event. The track record is such that we cannot accept that the church will be truthful or capable of self-regulation. The late disclosure of files by the church authorities to Ferns shows that the instinct for self-preservation and denial is still rife.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This "no more Mr. Nice Guy" approach by the State means no longer countenancing the unhealthy enmeshing of the church in the secular layers of our society. It means no more consultation between church and State on IVF, abortion services, stem cell research, Ireland's support for family planning in the Third World, contraception or supports for single mothers, adoption, homosexuality and civil marriage. In a democracy, all views can be articulated but the special relationship must be over. The deference must be over. The cosy phone calls from All Hallows to Government Buildings must end.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">This also means, like it or not, looking at the church's almost universal control of education in this country. Our national school system was established 170 years ago and while it was originally meant to be, to use today's terminology, mixed religion or multi-denominational, in practice this did not happen and, as a result, virtually all national schools are under the management of one church, the Catholic Church. Despite the State paying the bulk of the building and running costs, the relevant church authorities privately own and control the vast majority of national schools. The bishops are patrons of 95% of national schools. The same institution that has been so found wanting effectively decides who is suitable or not to work in our children's schools. If our stated commitment to taking all necessary steps to protect children is to be more than just rhetoric, it is imperative that we radically address this issue. Indeed, the investigation into the archdiocese of Dublin should deal with transfers of lay teachers for allegations of child abuse without due regard to child protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I would like to turn to the money trail. The question of finances is perhaps a neuralgic issue. Again, in light of the terrible wrongs done to the victims, discussing finances might be seen as unseemly, but I believe money has been the motivating factor in the actions and inaction of the church authorities in this whole affair. Central to the church's self-serving response over the years has been private financial settlements, without liability, as well as confidentiality deals. If the State is carrying out audits in every diocese, investigations that could uncover scores of previously undiscovered abuse cases, we must also audit the church's wealth. Given the nature and extent of the wrongdoing of this institution against citizens, the church should be obliged to open up its books. Discovery orders could be made to gain some understanding of the money trail. Such an audit of church assets and wealth is long overdue and, in fact, should have been in place prior to the indemnity deal given to the religious orders.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">I note that, true to form, the church has the temerity to claim €100,000 for its legal costs for dealing with the Ferns Inquiry. It is estimated that the church now faces a compensation bill of up to €250 million for clerical sex abuse resulting from existing claims and new claims set to emerge following publication of the Ferns Report. On top of this is the €128 million already paid to victims of abuse in children's homes run by religious orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Going back to the need for separation and objectivity between church and State, sadly, it is difficult to argue that this was the paradigm within which the negotiations on the indemnity deal struck by the Government with the religious orders took place. The cost to the orders was approximately €128 million, while the cost to the State would be a blank cheque, the State covering every lawsuit brought against the congregations for child abuse in reformatories and industrial schools. This is not to understate the share of responsibility the State has for some of the horrors that unfolded in these terrible places. The uncomfortable fact is that, in several cases taken in the courts recently by victims outside the redress scheme, the liability of the State has not been proven. Therefore, the blanket indemnity was over-generous on behalf of the State. Why? All roads lead to the deference of the special relationship. The result was a bad deal for the State and a good deal for the religious orders. Initial estimates of the potential liability were in the region of €250 million. Three or four times that amount may prove closer to reality in terms of liability to the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The special relationship has not served Ireland or its citizens well. It did not serve the victims of abuse well. For example, the implication in the Ferns Report is that complaints of sexual abuse made against priests to the gardaí were not handled appropriately. Some of the complaints were not even recorded in any Garda file. They were not investigated in an appropriate manner due, perhaps, to reluctance by members of the Garda to investigate allegations against members of the Catholic clergy. Again, the deference descended. Undoubtedly progress has been made in terms of the independence of the Garda now <i>vis-à-vis</i> the church and that must continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I welcome the Government's commitment to introduce new legislation as outlined by the Minister. However, legislation alone will not suffice. The law must operate and apply in a context of objectivity and cool detachment. Victims, family members, friends, Ministers, politicians, gardaí, judges and all of us must not be deterred or reluctant to speak out and to act robustly on these matters. I welcome the fact the Government will move to allow for barring orders against persons, including priests, who are a risk to children in order to restrain them from occupying any employment that exposes them to children, and provide for a new criminal offence of failing to protect children from injury, sexual abuse or reckless endangerment.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Whatever about the failure to protect I turn to the failure to prosecute cases of child abuse. For many years I have been baffled, in Opposition and in Government, by the non-prosecution of child abuse cases, even when validated by the health boards. As Opposition spokesperson for justice between 1992 and 1997 I tabled dozens of parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach for the DPP asking why the statistics were so skewed. Because of my interest over many years I became a contact point for many families exasperated because of such non-prosecutions. The DPP does not give reasons, leaving victims and their families distraught. In some cases it was due to delay. Frequently the accused would take civil action seeking to stop the prosecution on the grounds that delay in prosecution prejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial. This device was successfully used by the notorious child rapist, George Gibney, who escaped prosecution and is now living abroad. Many abusers have availed of this device and it is the Judiciary, not the State, that has developed, to some extent, the law in this regard. We must change the law to state that delay alone cannot be used by the defendant in child abuse cases to stop a prosecution. The passage of time and thus delay is part and parcel of the crime of child abuse. Many victims will only disclose when they are safe or adult.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">It is time for straight talking and respectful disengagement by the State from the Irish Catholic Church across all sectors. The enmeshed relationship has been characteristic of Irish life since the foundation of the State. One recalls de Valera's drafts of Bunreacht na hÉireann being edited page by page by the hierarchy and my party's unhappy but courageous suggestion of disengagement, known as taking God out of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">One recalls also the many battles, mostly lost, between State and church, the pregnant women isolated and condemned from pulpits, dismissed from school, banished to Magdalen laundries, all the acts of a non-loving church; the unrelenting deference expected and given at State functions and in terms of diplomatic protocol in Ireland with the Papal Nuncio as <i>numero uno</i> in our diplomatic corps; the sweetheart deals for residential abuse; the non-extradition of Brendan Smyth; the related intrigue in the then Attorney-General’s Office and the inactions of official A, issues never really resolved as to any church involvement; the millions of euro paid in private financial settlements by the archdiocese of Dublin and, perhaps, others; the abortion referenda and the wording negotiated with the bishops in advance and with the pro-life movement; the tip-toeing around the State ceremony marking the elevation of Desmond Connell to Cardinal in Dublin Castle, known as the Larkin affair; my own mauling when as a Minister of State I criticised the church authorities in 2001 for doing what this report has now found, transferring paedophile priests rather than exposing them to prosecution, that many priests so transferred went on to play leading roles in the child abuse scandals in the United States; the secrecy about money and possible movement offshore thereof; the hiring of the best lawyers by the church, the hardball played by them on behalf of the church that still goes on; and the deafening and unbelievable immoral silence of the Vatican on the Ferns Report. It is overwhelming and compelling — there is no other way to say it and the special relationship must end between the State and the Catholic Church. As a faith organisation it must look to rebuild, if it can, its relationship with its flock. As one who has irreconcilable differences with the institution of the church, as is probably obvious, unless it allows the laity in, including women, it is in terminal decline. To follow my logic, those are religious matters, not matters for the State.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I welcome the Ferns Report. It sets out in black and white what many of us have known for a long time is happening in Irish society. It is a pity this report cannot be more widely available to people. Even I was shocked by the physical descriptions of some of the abuse when put down in black and white. We suspected many of the cases were taking place right across the country but I am shocked to see it written in a Government report.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">There are many reasons people look away, and continue to look away, when faced with the appalling issue of child abuse. The Ferns Report has focused on clerical sexual abuse in one diocese and has found 100 cases. I believe there are many more that have not been reported for a number of reasons, even within the diocese of Ferns. If County Wexford which makes up most of the diocese of Ferns contains 3% of the population, and assuming the rest of the country is exactly the same, then a nationwide report would unearth up to 3,000 cases of clerical sexual abuse, a huge figure by any estimation.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">We are told clerical sex abuse cases only make up 5% of the total amount of child sexual abuse cases in the country. If we were to use that figure, it means more than 60,000 Irish children have been abused during the past few decades. This is an appalling vista that begs the question why so many people continued to look away, especially those who were in positions of power and who must have known so much about what was going on. Why did they all look away?</p>
          <p eId="para_354">There is no doubt that many, clergy included, were never aware of issues such as child sexual abuse. I made inquiries in Wexford from people who attended St. Peter's College in Wexford around that time. Most of those were aware there were priests who had to be watched out for but were not aware of the extent of the abuse taking place. There were many others who would have known many of the priests named in the report and would never have suspected there was anything untoward about them or that they would have been involved in anything so criminal. Genuinely, people did not know what was going on. There were others, clergy and lay people alike, who said they were aware that inappropriate behaviour was taking place but for a number of reasons said nothing about it. We should try to tease out why nothing was said about it. Sometimes it has to do with the sort of society we had at the time. To make allegations against a priest would have brought more trouble to the person making the allegation than it would have brought to the abuser of young children. There was the risk of being sued if one made allegations that one could not substantiate. Two points have borne that out: legislation from 1998 giving protection to people who make these allegations and, as stated by Deputy O'Donnell, the fact that so many of the prosecutions fail. People were very slow, certainly in the 1980s when I was growing up, to make these allegations. For many of the victims and their families the shame of what happened often drove them to try to cover it up. They did not want to report it and did not want it out in the public domain. It was not so much about prosecutions, they simply did not want people to know that a member of their family had been abused in such a way. Regrettably, it was an issue that was covered up by all parts of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">However, there were those who knew what was going on and its extent and did nothing about it. They may well have known that crimes had been committed that warranted serious criminal charges and they still did nothing about it. A serious point that has not been teased out in the report is why many in authority were aware of extremely serious crimes being committed against children and did nothing about it. It is not good enough for them to say things were different in those days. They were the people in charge and the people who could have done something about it. All my life, like many in the House, I have had close associations with the Catholic Church when growing up. I went to Mass and served as an altar boy and would have been in close contact with a number of priests. As a teenager I attended a religious boarding school and would have been in regular contact with members of the clergy. Of all the members of the clergy I came across as a child and as a teenager I am aware of only one priest whom we had been warned by other students to stay away from. After six or seven months in the boarding school and following allegations of certain behaviour the priest was moved to another parish and was subsequently prosecuted for the crime of child sexual abuse when he was working as a priest in a parish. Is this practice still continuing? If so, what is being done about it? It is quite possible that priests are still being moved around when they are causing problems in a parish or allegations are being made against them. We need to know whether this practice has been stopped and what the bishops, as the people in charge, are doing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We have much to learn from history. In 1985 a document entitled Building on Reality was published. This was a Government policy document covering the years 1985 to 1989 and gave rise to the Child Care Act. It is strange that no mention was made of child sexual abuse in many of those policy documents, even though in 1987 the Department of Health issued child abuse guidelines clarifying procedural issues and giving responsibility to the health boards. A 1989 report of cases investigated by health boards stated that 34% were classified as sexual abuse; 8% were classified as emotional abuse; 11% were classified as physical abuse; and 47% were classified as neglect of children. Throughout the 1980s the Government was aware what was going on, given that the Department of Health was issuing guidelines and the health boards were publishing reports on the issue. A charge of "See no evil, hear no evil" might have been made against legislators and those with a role in political life. I am surprised that the matter was left out of policy documents between 1985 and 1989.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">While the public representatives might not have been on the ball regarding what they should have been doing, it was scandalous that between 1987 and 1989, as detailed in the report, most of the dioceses took out insurance to protect themselves from being sued by victims of abuse. The bishops have hard questions to answer in this regard. Why did they take this course of action without at the same time introducing child protection guidelines to protect children with whom they had extremely close contact at the time? The same is true of vulnerable adults for the care of whom many of the religious institutions had responsibility. The Ferns Report states that very few files were available in the diocese of Ferns prior to 1990. Why was the diocese taking out insurance if it did not have any files available?</p>

          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_360">We need to discover the terms of that insurance agreement. How much information did the diocese disclose to the insurance company? The real Ferns Report may now lie in what was disclosed to the insurance company. This is an important point which the Minister should pursue.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The issue of child sexual abuse in Ireland moved from one spoken of behind closed doors out into the open in the 1990s, which coincided with the time when the power of the church was weakening. I am sure Deputy Howlin will agree that 15 years later many people find it very difficult to face up to the issue of child sexual abuse, which is our experience on the ground in County Wexford even today. People still do not want to talk about the issues exposed in this report. We need to look back to the 1990s to consider what brought the issue into the open and to learn from that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">While it had nothing to do with clerics, the Kilkenny incest case sticks out in my mind as a pivotal point when we exposed the horrors of child sexual abuse in our society. The McColgan case in the north west came to light in 1995. The horrors of the Goldenbridge orphanage were exposed in the 1990s. We had the cases of Fr. Brendan Smyth and Fr. Payne which gave undeniable proof, if it were needed, that child sexual abuse was present in our society and that we were doing little about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I often wonder why more than 100 cases have come to light in the diocese of Ferns warranting a separate report. The archdiocese of Dublin will be subject to the same kind of review. However, we need to look at what happened throughout the country. I do not believe that County Wexford and the archdiocese of Dublin were the only two hotspots for this kind of terrible abuse. We should try to explore why this came to light in Ferns. Perhaps it had something to do with the Kilkenny incest case, following which a report was issued and recommendations made, which were clearly followed up by the South Eastern Health Board at the time. The recommendations covered the following: how to report child abuse; holding case conferences; interagency co-operation between the Garda and schools; recording of information; prevention and family liaison supports; and counselling for victims of abuse. Things changed in the south east in the 1990s. While the Kilkenny incest case was not the only factor, it was important.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">There was the hard work of brave individuals who came out and spoke, including many who had been victims of abuse. It was highly significant that some of the victims came forward and made themselves known. They put their names in the media and broke the stigma. Many of these people have led terrible lives because they carried a stigma and feel they continue to be the victims. In some respects they may feel they were wrong. We need to give great credit to people like Colm O'Gorman who came forward and exposed what was going on. If those people had not come forward we might never have had the Ferns Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">When discussing this matter we should be careful not to engage in a witch-hunt. Nobody wants a repeat of what happened in Cleveland in Britain in the 1980s, which was a disaster for the families involved. Two doctors made allegations that children were being abused and many children were taken from their parents and placed in care. The parents had to fight for many years to have their children returned from care and it was eventually proved that no abuse had been carried out. The over-zealousness of the two doctors resulted in children wrongfully being taken from their parents. However, we also need to face up to child sexual abuse in our society and challenge it in a serious way. In 20 years' time a report into what we do now may be published, just as people look back to what we should have done between 1985 and 1990 and what happened in the 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Some good things have happened, including protection for those who report child abuse to protect them from being sued by the abusers, who can be very manipulative and well able to get their own way. I welcome the report's recommendation that the non-reporting of a crime become a crime in itself, which might change behaviour. If we cannot do so in a nice way we should use the iron fist of the law to change the behaviour of those with responsibility, including bishops and school principals. We need to invest more in child protection. The Minister of State referred to the Garda vetting unit. We must not forget those doing fantastic work for voluntary groups, both within the church and outside it. They must not be forgotten. I hope that my colleague, Deputy Enright, will speak more about a policy she published a year ago on the matter of vetting and protecting children in our society.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">I listened with interest to the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and I wish him well. I am sorry Deputy O'Donnell is not here because I listened with some surprise to what she had to say. Her speech was lacking in honesty and I believe it was an attempt to rewrite history. The Progressive Democrats has been in government for the past eight years and bears equal responsibility for the decisions of Government, including the infamous indemnity deal with the religious orders that in effect let them off the hook. The Progressive Democrats must take responsibility for that with Fianna Fáil. They must also take responsibility for trying to have a referendum on abortion passed which would have created a threat to the lives of young desperate pregnant women. That is equally the record of the Progressive Democrats and nothing said this morning can negate that fact. At least Fianna Fáil takes responsibility for what it does, even when it is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Ferns Inquiry report is one of the most disturbing documents ever to come into the public domain. The report recites a litany of depravity and pain, cowardice and courage, shameful evasion of duty and quite remarkable dignity and resilience. It paints a picture of how latter day scribes and Pharisees protected their institutional interests and how children suffered grievously and struggled as adults to cope with what had been done to them. In the words of Colm O'Gorman of One in Four:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_369">The Ferns Report speaks of the sexual abuse and rape of children by priests in the Diocese of Ferns spanning a period of forty years. Those children as adults spoke out, many turned to their Bishop, and they were not responded to. In many cases they spoke to others and often their cases came directly or indirectly to the attention of the Garda or the Health Board. The gross failure of the Catholic Church to respond to their complaints and the failure of state agencies to effectively investigate and prevent the abuse of those victims and countless other victims is detailed with forensic insight in the Ferns Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">With such a report, one looks at the recommendations and whether they will be implemented. However, all of us have a duty to ask the deeper question the report raises. How could this have possibly happened? Much of the answer rests in the existence and exercise of unaccountable power. For too many years, too much of our society was controlled by an institution which exerted too much influence and which saw itself as wholly unaccountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">We live in different times, but we must not lose sight of the lesson. Where there is power without democratic accountability, that power will be abused. Where there is authority without transparency, that authority becomes oppressive. When we lose sight of the basic principle of equality, human rights will be trampled.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Those who raped and abused the children of Ferns were figures who held responsible positions in society, including in a number of cases the position of school manager. They are people who demanded and received the respect of others. Therefore, the abuse of trust involved here, of parents and their children, is all the more shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Mr. Justice Murphy and his colleagues are entitled to our appreciation and thanks. They in turn have recorded their debt of gratitude to the people who spoke about their experiences of abuse, and so should we. We should also recognise that there is still a hidden reservoir of pain being plumbed. In one week, since publication of this report, the agency One in Four has received 250 new approaches from victims of abuse. During the period from May to September the total number of approaches was 380. Ministers and Catholic bishops have called on abuse victims to come forward, but unless the resources are provided to meet their needs these so far unheard voices will be speaking into the wilderness.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The report is quite clear in stating where the priorities of the Church authorities lay: "By failing to properly identify the problem of child abuse even to colleagues and professionals, Bishops placed the interests of the Church ahead of children whose protection and safety should at all times have been a priority". The Catholic Church may well believe that as an institution it has the right to self-regulate and develop and follow its own internal rules, but we are a democratic society and as such we have a right to ensure that control of our education system is at all times open and accountable to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">It is said that a childhood can last a lifetime. For those who have suffered abuse as children, that is true. We know that the terrible effects and the grave psychological damage of having been abused can lead people to suffer throughout their life. The Ferns Report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_376">The impact of such abuse can have far reaching consequences, not only for the victim, but also for their relatives and friends. This damage can continue over a period of many years and into subsequent generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Since the report was published, the victims of child sexual abuse have heard us express our revulsion that such crimes could be committed against children, our astonishment at the nature and extent of this phenomenon and our determination to ensure it does not continue. If I were one of those victims, I would concentrate on this third aspect. How great is the State's determination to take steps against child abusers and what, specifically, is proposed?</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The first issue facing us now is the Dublin inquiry to which the Government has long since committed and has finally announced. The Labour Party welcomes the appointment of Judge Yvonne Murphy, but we are concerned at the restrictive timeframe imposed on the inquiry. It has taken the Minister three years to deliver it and he has no qualms about justifying the delays. However, there is a real danger that the strict limits he is applying to it may prevent it completing its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">There is another concern. The terms of reference confine the inquiry to examining a sample of "complaints or allegations of child sexual abuse made ... against clergy operating under the aegis of the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin. " This would appear to exclude members of religious orders from the remit of the inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Let us take a practical example involving three men in religious life against whom allegations of child sexual abuse are made. The first is a Christian Brother who worked in a residential unit. The claims against him will be examined by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The second is a Dublin parish priest, a manager of a national school. His case will be inquired into by the Dublin inquiry. The third is again a Christian Brother who worked in a non-residential school. The allegations made against him, no matter how serious, will not be investigated by either inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">When the Minister first announced this inquiry in 2002, he held preliminary meetings with representatives of the diocese and of CORI. I do not know the purpose of the second meeting since the inquiry announced yesterday has no bearing on CORI members, unless, perhaps, securing such an outcome was the purpose of that meeting. I would be grateful if the Minister would elucidate on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">With regard to the time an inquiry can take, I am conscious of the facts that pertain to an investigation into the Kilcornan centre run by the Brothers of Charity in Galway where there were allegations of sexual abuse of up to 100 residents in the years from 1965 to 1998. These are people with severe physical and intellectual disabilities. In response to the allegations, the Western Health Board established an inquiry. Six and a half years later we still await publication of that report. In 2003 a health board official admitted that the investigations had taken a great deal longer than anticipated. We should know why it is taking so long to publish its findings? Why has no interim report been published and what is being done to address the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_383">On the more general question of what reforms are immediately proposed, it is important to address this question in the light of one of the more sobering statistics quoted by Judge Murphy in his report. According to research undertaken by the College of Surgeons on behalf of two Departments in 2002, the prevalence of child sexual abuse by religious is 3.2% of all reported cases. That figure should not, of course, provide comfort to the religious since they represent nowhere near 3.2% of the adult population. Nonetheless, it should give us cause for thought. The figures published last week on the numbers of children taken into care as a result of sexual abuse are also highly relevant. One does not take a child away from its parents and out of the family home because the child has been abused outside the home by someone who is not a family member.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Mr. Justice Murphy points out that what he calls "third party" abuse of children — the systematic abuse of children outside the family and the family home by third parties in a position of trust and authority over children — represents a small fraction of the abuse occurring in Irish society. That is not to say, however, that it does not constitute a major issue for organisations entrusted with the care of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The recommendations set out in the report are addressed to three separate Departments. I will refer in more detail later to the disjointed nature of Government structures for the care and protection of children. My colleagues, Deputies O'Sullivan and Costello, will deal in more detail later this afternoon with the recommendations pertaining to the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, respectively. Some of the recommendations in the report relate to the health services. The essential problem in respect of the health services was that although the health boards — now the HSE — had a power to investigate, they did not have a power to intervene or to take other action on foot of their investigations. It seems that, in such circumstances, some of what they did may have been <i>ultra vires</i>. Therefore, the proposed new power to take out barring orders against third parties is welcome. I am not convinced that the HSE’s approach to the duty of care it owes to children at risk is adequate. The resources and training given to HSE employees are also insufficient to meet that duty of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I would like to speak about a wider structural problem in the health sector. The poor relations within the health services are welfare in general and child welfare, care and protection in particular. It is an accident of history that such services are provided by the Department of Health and Children. Those of us who have tried to compare this country's health expenditure with that of other countries are aware that Ireland's figures are entirely skewed because much of what is classed in this country as health expenditure would be described in other countries as welfare provision. Child care and child protection will not thrive as long as they rank as also-rans within a health service that regards its main role as the provision of primary health care and hospital care to the general population.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Equally, preschool child care will not be taken seriously as long as its delivery is entrusted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Regardless of the good intentions and dedication of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan — I do not doubt his ability or dedication — at the end of the day he is just a Minister of State operating under three different Departments. He does not have his own budget, he does not have his own legislative programme and he does not have direct access to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Public Service Management Act 1997 was supposed to introduce new procedures to enable our system of government to manage better a cross-cutting issue such as child protection. Under that Act, the Government was supposed to be able to make orders assigning functions and responsibility for cross-departmental issues and allocating a team of civil servants dedicated to delivery. Eight years after the legislation was passed, no such order has been made in respect of an obvious issue like child protection, or in respect of any other issue. As long as Departments and Ministers maintain this silo mentality, something as important as the protection of our children, which is the shared responsibility of three Departments or Ministers, will remain the priority of none. I recognise that almost every interest group with an agenda for Government action demands the appointment of a Minister, or a seat at the Cabinet table to put it another way, to deal with the issue in question. It is clear that the present system is not working and needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The issues which arise from the Ferns Report will not be dealt with in a coherent fashion if they continue to be divided between three Departments, none of which wants responsibility for managing what it perceives to be unmanageable. A single Department of children's affairs would deal with preschool, primary and secondary education, the child care and child protection functions of the health boards and the juvenile justice functions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It would be able to adopt an approach that encompasses the Breaking the Cycle programme, school truancy, homelessness, juvenile diversion, the Stay Safe programme, children at risk and much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Labour Party's position on this matter is clear — children's voices deserve to be heard, children's rights must be recognised and services to children must be provided coherently and holistically. I do not think the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, or any other Minister of State can guarantee us that this will happen. If that is the lesson we will take from the Ferns Report, I hope it is one we can act on. If legislation is published to protect children, the Labour Party will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Government in that regard. It is important, at all times, that there should be honesty about the Government's record and an honest approach to this important issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_393">It is with great sadness and anger that I speak during this debate on the Ferns Report, which was published by Mr. Justice Murphy, Dr. Helen Buckley and Dr. Laraine Joyce, whom I thank and commend on their work. This horrific report identifies over 100 allegations of child sexual abuse which were made against 21 priests in the diocese of Ferns between 1962 and 2002. This nightmare report, which deals with the hurt and pain of children, is just the tip of the iceberg. Everyone has to wake up to the reality that great pain and hurt was suffered by children who were sexually abused, exploited and raped. I will always focus on the victims and the survivors. During this debate, Members need to react to the Ferns Report in a way that supports and assists the victims and puts in place prevention measures for the future. If we cannot do that, we might as well pack up and go home.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">We need to face the reality that most child abusers are aware before the age of 18 that they have a sexual interest in children. That is why many such people have an interest in the caring professions relating to children. As the isolation of children is an important part of their process of manipulation, there is a need for the Stay Safe programme to be put in place for all children. I appeal to the 20% of primary schools which do not offer this excellent child safety programme to reconsider their position. It is worth noting that genuine research, particularly that published by Professor Anthony Beech of the University of Birmingham, has indicated that 58.5% of child sexual abusers were aware of their sexual arousal to younger children by the age of 16. Some 92.5% of such people were aware of their feelings by the age of 21. Such early awareness is not unusual for sexual offenders. Harsh facts have to be faced if we are to protect children. For example, we have to address the reality that 42.5% of child sexual abusers said that while abusing children was not their primary motivation for working with children, it formed part of their motivation. Now is the time to acknowledge that the existence of paedophiles has been a reality for centuries and to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the proposal that the commission will investigate any instance of dioceses not implementing church guidelines in respect of child sexual abuse. There have been many failures in this regard. I would like to cite an example of how guidelines were ignored and children were knowingly placed in danger. In the case in question, a victim's attempt to redress the matter received a spectrum of responses, from cold indifference to aggression. In this example, the church and some national groups failed our children. In the late 1970s, a religious principal teacher of a Dublin primary school sexually abused a 12 year old boy, who is now a personal friend of mine. In the mid-1990s, the victim of the abuse informed, in writing, the provincial leader of the abuser's religious order. Some 18 months after he made the allegation, the victim became aware that his abuser was still teaching. It was obvious that nothing had been done about his allegation, so the victim contacted the Garda. Despite the involvement of the Garda and the then Eastern Health Board, the abuser was allowed to continue to teach for a further period of 18 months. In other words, he taught for a total of three years after the allegation was made and was removed from the school only when a charge was brought against him. He was subsequently convicted of abusing the victim known to me and another young boy.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">In the late 1990s, after the man in question had been convicted, the victim visited the Christian Brothers province leader — I refer to St. Mary's province — to ask him why many of the undertakings promised in the 1996 publication, <i>Child Sexual Abuse — A Framework for a Church Response</i>, were not delivered on in this case. The province leader became angry and enraged. He lost his temper, raised his voice and banged his hand against the arm of his chair. He acted in an abusive, aggressive, bullying and threatening manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The victim sought the help of the primary schools branch of the National Parents Council in an attempt to provide more protection and justice for pupils in schools and to share the insights he had gleaned from the entire experience. He asked the council to support him in finding out why a teacher accused of conducting sexual abuse was allowed to continue to teach young boys in a school for three years. It is shocking that he did not even receive an acknowledgement of his letter from the council. Some time later, he telephoned the council only to be informed that it had forwarded his letter to the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association. When he contacted the CPSMA by phone he was told it was not interested in what he had to say and that a file would not be created on this matter. This is but one story of the refusal of the church and of national groups to take on board, listen to and learn from the experience of victims. Its inaction and coldness has caused great distress which compounds the effects of the original abuse. I welcome the commission and I hope the victims' wisdom and voices will drive its activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I also wish to raise the important issue of sexual abuse of children and adults with an intellectual disability. This is another scandal. Most of their voices have not been heard and will never be heard. This is the hidden story of this debate. Children and adults with disabilities have been abused for years and nothing has been done. I urge everyone to read the report and implement the recommendations immediately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_399">I thank Mr. Justice Murphy and his team for a very thorough report. The Ferns Report engenders both revulsion and deep anger in the reader. As I read some of these graphic accounts I have to confess I wanted to inflict serious injury on some of the perpetrators of this abuse. In particular, when one reads the accounts of the activities of Fr. Fortune, one is lost for words. The only way I can describe this person is evil personified. One account that stood out for me was that of Colin who said that on the day he was getting married, the priest officiating said that he believed they had a mutual acquaintance, namely, Fr. Fortune. This is a sign of a really sick mind but it also shows that there was a network of sorts in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">As we get over our justifiable outrage we must ask serious questions because the scale of this abuse could not and cannot have taken place in a vacuum. People knew, people suspected and many people, I am afraid to say, turned a blind eye. Those who complained were ignored. It was similar to the type of culture described by Seamus Heaney when describing Northern Ireland, "whatever you say, say nothing." It appears that politicians knew because, for example, a councillor put forward a motion to the South Eastern Health Board and only got the support of one other councillor. Who were those other councillors and why did they not support that motion? The church has primary responsibility for all this but the political institutions also let these children down.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">From pages 238 and 239 we also know that the report was known to the Office of the Garda Commissioner. It knew about the activities of Canon Clancy because a letter was sent to the local sergeant, yet it was not acted upon. If the Garda Commissioner knew about this, clearly the Minister for Justice at the time must have known about it, yet nothing was done and no further investigation is being carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I listened to what Deputy Twomey had to say. My experience is similar to his as I too went to a diocesan college and I did not know of any priests who were involved in abuse. On occasion, some engaged in physical violence but I knew of no examples of sexual abuse. For the most part, many priests led exemplary lives in difficult circumstances. A number of things must emerge from this report. Deputy Sargent referred to this matter during Leaders' Questions. The church must reform and the issue of celibacy must be seriously examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We must also examine the role of the church in primary schools. I do not think priests should have an automatic right to be on school boards. The Ombudsman for Children has said that many areas need to be examined. She is on record as saying that the legislation in her areas of responsibility is not strong enough. Many sections of the Children Act 2001 have still not been implemented. Section 10 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 states that better notification is needed and the Garda needs to be in a position to better respond when we know there is a paedophile in an area. These are all areas that must be addressed on foot of this report. It is a shocking report and if it is not acted upon, that would be even more shocking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_404">This report reveals a clerical establishment that wilfully ignored what can only be described as an epidemic of abuse. It reveals a picture of rogue clerics preying on successive generations and being facilitated in this by the church authorities. What emerges is an attitude on the part of the church that sees children as objects rather than human beings. They were objects of temptation for so-called "weak" priests. The little action that was taken was about helping the priest to resist "temptation"— the children were apparently irrelevant. The perceived precedence of the church's reputation over all other considerations led to untold suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The authority enjoyed by the church at the time was something that was valued not just by that institution but also by many other conservative forces in society. The inability or unwillingness of the Garda to take action on this matter is a case in point. At one stage an allegation of the most appalling abuse carried out on the altar against young girls preparing for their first holy communion ran into a brick wall because the file disappeared, not the witnesses or victims, just the file. I seriously question how the disappearance of a file containing witness statements could cause such a serious investigation to fall. Surely in a matter of this gravity the taking of a second set of statements would have been the normal practice. Only in doing so could the authorities have shown that they really did intend to prosecute and protect the children concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I note also that the garda responsible for the disappearance of this file was subsequently honoured by the Vatican for services rendered. It would be most useful if the church could clarify the circumstances and reason for this honour. Until it does, the suspicion must be that the attitude of cover-up stretched right into the heart of the Vatican, if indeed it did not emanate from there in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I do not intend to go into individual cases. However, it is worth mentioning the case of Seán Fortune to illustrate the processes at work. Here was a priest who had been identified as a predatory paedophile before he was ordained, yet he was ordained. Throughout his time in the priesthood the most vile allegations followed him around like a dark cloud. The dogs in the street knew what he was, yet he continued on with the air of a man who considered himself untouchable, and well he might. Time after time his bishop ignored the reports that he received and allowed him to continue to wreak havoc with young lives in the diocese, so much so that at least two of his victims were driven to suicide. In these circumstances those who knew and did nothing are as culpable as the abusers themselves, perhaps even more so. The abuse was perpetrated in all areas, in the home, in schools, at social events, anywhere the abuser could find a victim. We should make no mistake, there are abusers in all walks of life — they are not only clerics. The Ferns Report, shocking as it is, is but the tip of an iceberg that lies deep in Irish society and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I will conclude by making a number of recommendations that must be implemented urgently if this scourge is to be seriously tackled. The guidelines in Children First — National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children must be fully resourced and implemented so that all the agencies covered, including the Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive, schools and voluntary organisations are enabled to fulfil the role outlined for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">For every one staff member working with children in this country, there are at least 20 volunteers. Therefore, Garda vetting must be made available to the voluntary sector as a matter of urgency. The basic child protection awareness module delivered to trainee gardaí in Templemore is grossly inadequate given the key responsibility they have in the area of child protection. Therefore, I urge that a comprehensive child protection training package should be developed and delivered to all gardaí as a compulsory part of their training.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The numbers of children first information and advice persons in the HSE and their resources should be increased in the HSE areas to ensure the child protection training they deliver to staff and volunteers working with children is available to all who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">This report exposes the extent to which the power of the church in Ireland was used to destroy the rights and the lives of children. For too long that power went unchallenged by the State. Indeed, it was enhanced by the State which abandoned so many children into the hands of their abusers. The lessons must be learned and action must follow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_412">Like other colleagues, I come to this debate with much sadness because any of us who read the report, or who tried to understand the issues, are hugely upset by it. I compliment my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on his work and on his handling of what is very difficult business for him. We should wish him well as he proceeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">As other colleagues have said, this debate is about the development of Irish society. There has been much talk lately about how Ireland is moving forward and progressing and how it is now seen throughout the world as an important player and a rich country. Much of what is going on now is about looking back at our past and exposing many things that happened as our State developed. A number of people have asked me in recent days why this debate is only about Ferns because there is a lot of other business which needs to be tackled. Colleagues made the point last week that as we approach the centenary of the Easter Rising, we need to celebrate it in different ways. I will not get into the debate about parades but, as a nation, we need to come of age and to deal with issues which must be addressed. The business before us is about that and the broader issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I have read a good deal of the Ferns Report which makes appalling reading. We should, in the strongest way, condemn those involved in abusing children. As colleagues have said, let us hope it is not happening on our watch. I remember making the point on a number of occasions during my time on the eastern health board that we must ensure things are not happening today in the name of the State which will be exposed in 30, 40 or 50 years time. We must ensure people will say things should not have happened again because what took place 50, 60 or 70 years ago should not have been allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I come from a generation when children were beaten in school. As a small child I remember hearing people on the streets threaten children with being sent to Artane or to other industrial schools. Thank God I have no bad memories from my childhood, including from school. As colleagues said, the dogs on the streets were saying children were being badly abused and poorly looked after in these places but the State and the establishment did not seem to do anything about it. We have waited all these years to be brave enough to do something about it. Those who are exposing these issues are to be applauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Reference was made to the various organisations which have done marvellous work, including that of Mr. O'Gorman, One in Four. I got to know that organisation and a number of Mr. O'Gorman's colleagues. Members will remember that approximately two years ago, a constituent of mine, Mr. Tom Sweeney, was on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House. I found that a very difficult time in my political life in the sense that one was dealing with people who were clearly upset and who had been abused. We tried to help them as much as possible. I hope colleagues will not mind me saying this but I also got to know the new Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, at that time and I got a good appreciation of where he was coming from on this issue. I was very impressed by his reaction. I am glad he was so forthright this morning in welcoming the initiative of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government establishing the Dublin abuse inquiry. That is important and I am glad the Archbishop has promised full co-operation with the inquiry which is to be applauded. I hope we finally overcome the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">This debate should not only be about Ferns, although I certainly do not want to detract from the debate on it. However, I welcome the Dublin inquiry which should be wider. Despite our efforts in recent times and all that has been done, there is still a lot of hurt and a lot of upset people, many of whom still have not come forward and have not had their problems addressed. They include many people who were abused in institutions, State homes and so on. There are also other categories, including people who were abused in the home and who were the victims of incest. If we are growing up as a nation, if we are tackling these problems as a society and if we are prepared to expose the wrongdoers, then we should go all the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I join in the appeal to those people who have been abused and hurt to come forward. The Minister of State made the point that there is an open door and I hope people will find a way to address their issues. Other colleagues made the point about costs which I have also heard in conversations I have had with people in the Ferns diocese.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The efforts of Bishop Eamon Walsh in Wexford should be commended. He is an auxiliary bishop based in my constituency and the work he has done in Wexford has been generally applauded and universally acknowledged. We should also support the religious who are doing their jobs and I was glad to hear colleagues make this point, although counterpoints have been made in regard to the Catholic Church. I remember at a function a while ago making the point in regard to a departing priest that we should not be afraid to praise and applaud the work of priests who do their jobs in light of everything going on, who have no stain on their characters and who are very much respected by communities. The community very much appreciated me saying that. We should not be afraid to speak up for those in religious orders and the priesthood who want to get on with their jobs and who find what is going on very difficult to deal with but who deserve our praise. If we neutralise them in our parishes and deprived communities, where do we go? The lesson of the Third World should not be lost on us in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">It is important the Oireachtas has the opportunity to discuss this report. Serious issues must be dealt with. I do not believe the full story has come out and we must continue to press to ensure that happens. I look forward to the Minister of State's response in that regard. He should listen to those who say there are still many cases to be addressed and many hurt people to be heard. He should understand he will have the support of both sides of the House as he continues and represents those who did not have a voice for a long time.</p>

            <p eId="para_422">I have been examining proposals for reform of the Estimates and budgetary process in conjunction with my Government colleagues on foot of my budget 2005 announcement that I intended to consider options for reform in this regard. These deliberations are still ongoing and I will also take into account the recent Committee of Public Accounts report. As I indicated in my reply to a previous parliamentary question in the matter, changes to current practices would have to be capable of being implemented in the short and medium term, would need to meet best practice, improve both the quality of debate and the data available to the House on the budget, meet our obligations to the EU and be capable of being delivered within the existing budget timetable. As I stated in my 2005 budget announcement, changes must also retain the right and duty of the Government to direct and manage the budgetary process.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">As regards the timing of the budget, it is critical that the Government in formulating the budget should have the latest information available on fiscal trends before adopting the strategy for the following year. Thus, information on revenues to the end of November is to hand when the final budget strategy is adopted. Similar issues arise in determining expenditure, for instance, on the question of capital spend or possible carryover. I hope to announce the Government's proposals for reform shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_424">I am fully committed to the principle that every euro of taxpayers' money is well spent. I refer the Deputy to my speech of 20 October last to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce where I outlined a number of measures to improve value for money. This initiative builds on other measures introduced in recent years to improve the management of capital programmes and projects including five-year multi-annual budgets and revised guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure. The overall impact of these various developments has created a better framework for achieving value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_425">I thank the Minister for his reply, which is clear on commitment but short on detail. I am disappointed the Minister does not intend to have the new procedures in place to allow us to have a more meaningful debate on the Estimates and budget for 2006. I refer to five white elephants, e-voting, MediaLab, Stadium Campus Ireland, accommodation for asylum seekers that was not occupied and the health service computer system. Between them, they cost €500 million, which would have furnished 500,000 families with a medical card, ensured 40,000 inpatient procedures and 2,000 extra gardaí on the street. The issue of waste has a real impact on the capacity to deliver services to people who need them.</p>
            <p eId="para_426">What changes will the Minister make to the budgetary process? Will Estimates be provided earlier? Will we be provided with more resources within the Houses to evaluate them? Will key performance indicators be linked to Estimates when we vote on them? Will a cost benefit analysis of taxes be conducted so we can see that what is being done on the tax front is sensible? Will the Minister change the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General so that instead of examining repeated mistakes, the causes of mistakes are addressed? Will he reinstitute the programme review, which has been allowed to rust under recent stewardships in the Department?</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_427">I hope to make an announcement in the budget on the ongoing reform process I have in mind. My initial reply outlined a number of issues that must be borne in mind in the context of reform. We have obligations such as reporting to the EU and so on, and I referred to the question of timing. The PAC report, which is short but which contains annexes by Deputy Rabbitte and others, mentions the question of bringing forward the Budget Statement to September or October. However, we need updated data because when one is planning for the next financial year, the latest and most accurate data are needed. Under the present circumstances, having data up to the end of November provides a much better prospect of proper accountability regarding expenditure or revenue projections than relying on August's ERO or second quarter returns in June. I have come to that view and there is a strong reason that should be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_428">I refer to the Deputy's question regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General. The PAC's remit under Standing Order 156 provides that Ministers can be held to account. There is not an <i>ex ante</i> appraisal mechanism for the Comptroller and Auditor General and, therefore, I do not see why it should be provided for the PAC. That is not the issue. Ministers also have responsibilities and duties to discharge and we derive our executive authority from the House. The principle of democratic accountability is about the Executive acting and being held to account through the normal scrutiny powers available to the Parliament. We must be mindful in the context of reform not to provide that executive action is subject to <i>ex ante</i> appraisal before action is taken. That is a matter for Government to institute and decide upon in the interest of effective governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_429">The principle of accountability relates to decisions taken and consequential expenditure. We do not want to end up with a gridlocked system where so many appraisals, overlays, overviews and reviews are under way that the opportunity for action is lost. What is put forward as a more effective and efficient procedure might undermine the objective for which it was set up. I believe in trying to devise mechanisms which will streamline the process by improving the data and information available to the House, ensuring the committees can discharge their accountability requirements and involve Members more widely in their appraisal and participation in such a process but not in trying to put the cart in front of the horse where the rights and duties of Ministers are compromised to the point of not achieving the objectives which the Deputy wishes to set out. There are many views on these issues but I am giving a flavour of what I am trying to do.</p>

            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_430">The Comptroller and Auditor General's remit should be extended beyond reporting on past failures to improve corporate governance by preventing their repetition. That was my suggestion. Does the Minister agree that if key performance indicators are not published by Ministers with the Estimates, the Dáil cannot effectively hold them to account? For example, an allocation of €46 billion is announced but it is impossible to get a handle on what it will deliver. Does the Minister agree the phoney secrecy surrounding the budget and the belief that the Minister must wait for the last bit of data has resulted in bad decisions being made in the past without scrutiny such as those relating to medical cards for the over 70s and decentralisation? Proper scrutiny or evaluation of these proposals was not conducted. Does the Minister concur, therefore, that we need to open the system to proper accountability mechanisms, which go well beyond what he has indicated to date? We must have performance indicators and more detail. We must see them earlier and real evaluative work must be done, thereby learning the lessons of the past.</p>

        the number and percentage of income earners who are paying tax at the higher rate and the standard rate for 2005; the comparative figures for each year since 1998; when the Government will honour the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government that 80% of all earners will pay tax only at the standard rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_276" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_438">I refer the Deputy to tabular data provided in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 531 on 28 September 2005. This remains the most up-to-date information available. The data indicates that for 2005 only one third of earners will be on the higher rate of tax, while almost 31% are on the standard rate and almost 36% are exempt.</p>
            <p eId="para_439">The 80% target in An Agreed Programme for Government was set in the context of a broader economic and budgetary strategy which provides, among other things, that the public finances will be kept in a healthy condition and that personal and business taxes will be kept down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the economy. Further progress in this area will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual budgets over the coming years consistent with the Government's overall economic and budgetary strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">The Government's tax policies since 1997 have ensured that Ireland now has the lowest tax wedge in the EU, and one of the very lowest in the entire OECD as measured by that organisation using comparative data relating to those earning an average production wage. After tax income for a person on the average industrial wage, adjusted for consumer price index inflation, is now 40% higher than it was in 1997. Approximately half of this increase is due to lower taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">Moreover, one reason many income earners pay at the higher rate is that incomes have increased significantly. This is not an indication of a problem but of a major economic success.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_442">The Government made solemn promises in its partnership agreement for Government and in Sustaining Progress agreements with the social partners that 80% of tax payers would pay at the standard rate or below. The figures in the Minister's earlier answer show that this year only 67% of tax payers will be at the standard rate or below. Is this not the biggest smash and grab raid on ordinary PAYE workers by this Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_443">These workers were mugged by the previous Minister for Finance for two years in a row when he failed to index the credits and allowances. Deputy Cowen continued the mugging last year when he promised a decrease in numbers on the higher rate but the Minister's figures show some 25,000 more workers are now paying at the top rate than were paying at that rate last year. Where is the tax justice when millionaires pay no tax? Someone just above the standard industrial wage will pay 42% on overtime and additional earnings. Where is the tax justice for PAYE tax payers?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_278" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_444">There is significant tax justice for lower paid income earners since this Government came into office. When Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance one in four workers were exempt from the tax net on much lower income. More than one in three workers is now exempt from tax and this occurs in the context of an extra 500,000 people at work. The number of people exempt from tax has doubled. If I were to pursue a programme for Government which left one in four exempt from tax, Deputy Burton would quote figures of 75% of workers on the standard rate. The difference between 33% and 25%, some 8.5%, now exempt from tax because of our tax policies, would pay standard rate tax at 20%. In other words, Deputy Burton is criticising me for taking more people out of the tax net at the bottom and for not having 80% of taxpayers paying 20%. I have taken people out of the tax net. Is Deputy Burton suggesting I should not have changed the policy that left one in four workers exempt from tax? If this were the case an extra 8.5%, currently exempt, would pay tax at the standard rate and this would add to the figure of 67%, giving a total of more than 75%.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_445">Social partnership is under strain at present. The commitments by the Government in the programme for Government and in Sustaining Progress, to have 80% of taxpayers paying at the standard rate, have been breached repeatedly. On the other hand, millionaires can pay no tax and the top 400 earners pay little or no tax, according to the Revenue Commissioners. A worker just above the average industrial wage, on approximately €32,000 per year, will pay 42% on a miserable bit of overtime. This is contrary to the Governments promises to the social partners. What is fair in that and what is the Minister doing to address this?</p>

            <p eId="para_448">Statistics can be used for any purpose but the reality is that an extra 500,000 people are working and there is an increase in the number of people who no longer pay tax. More people pay at the 20% rate than before. If the Deputy wishes to make the comparison between how workers fare under the tax policies of this Government and the policies when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, we can do so and I will win the argument hands down.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">In respect of high earners paying no tax I intend introducing proposals to deal with that situation in so far as I can. There may be reasons for paying no tax in cases of recurring losses, capital allowances or profit not being made. Others are using tax relief schemes in ways I did not envisage and I intend to introduce proposals on this matter. If one considers the number of people working and the number of people exempt from tax, working people have more money in their pockets as a result of our tax policies than was the case when the Labour Party was in office. The final nail in the coffin of Deputy Burton's argument is that of the 19 percentage points reducing taxes, only one occurred during a Labour Party administration.</p>

        the measures he has taken since taking office to protect vulnerable borrowers and the economy more generally from excessive levels of indebtedness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_451">The role of Government on credit growth and associated indebtedness has a number of distinct dimensions. First, it is important to note that, as far as overall economic and financial stability are concerned, the relevant measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland's fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world with Government indebtedness the second lowest in the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_452">Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall, to the maintenance of low unemployment and to the achievement of record employment levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">Similarly, the growth of private sector credit and indebtedness needs to be assessed in an appropriate context. In evaluating the financial position of the private sector, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector's balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house purchases which, in turn, creates an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector underpins high investment levels and the creation of business assets yielding future income.</p>
            <p eId="para_454">Account must also be taken of private sector savings levels. The Government has been actively promoting saving by individuals in the recent past, notably through the SSIA scheme. Comparatively high household savings rates by international standards in Ireland support the sustainability of household debt overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and the individual investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector, one that is both comprehensive and robust. I am satisfied that on foot of the progress made in recent years, especially in establishing the financial regulator with a particular focus on the interests of the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_456">Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. This follows from its role as part of the European system of central banks and its functions, as the financial regulator, concerning the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_284">
            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_457">I regret the Minister has not taken the opportunity of referring to the most recent Central Bank report, nor has he expressed his personal concern as to whether he thinks debt levels of 160% of average incomes represent a sustainable level of personal credit. The fact that this situation has been flagged in several recent reports by the Central Bank demands a political response from the Minister. His reply highlighted that the national debt has been stabilised, but that has largely been achieved through economic growth and the efficient management of that debt. The State still owes €33 billion. Other factors must also be taken into account, including a recent OECD report that inflation is undervalued by 1% because of high price inflation. Property values here are probably overvalued by between 5% and 7% and, therefore, they hardly provide the asset-backed measures to which the Minister referred in his reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_458">The debate is not about whether the European Central Bank is likely to raise the base interest rate, but by how much, 0.5% or 1%. In the coming year, the 160% level of personal debt is likely to rise substantially through default. The Minister seems to be devoid of responses as to what he intends to do politically to avoid this risk being experienced by individual citizens. It seems to be a transference of a national debt that the State owes to a large-scale personal debt for each citizen. What policies are being put in place to counteract that?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_285" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_459">The Central Bank's recently published <i>Financial Stability Report</i> concludes that a range of fundamental factors, such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates, have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The report, however, emphasises the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in any future economic environment. I share the Central Bank’s assessment of the importance of maintaining financial and economic stability. In that regard, I intend to continue a responsible approach to maintaining stability in our public finances, which will ensure that the strategic direction of our economy will focus on sustainable real improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_460">It is important that individual borrowers act sensibly. I agree with the Central Bank which recently reiterated the importance of prudent behaviour by borrowers and lenders. The possibility that interest rates may rise in the medium term, with obvious implications for the burden of repayments, should be kept firmly in mind. In so far as the banking sector is concerned, the Central Bank in its recent financial stability review concluded that the Irish banking system is in a good state of health and is reasonably well placed to cope with any adverse short or medium-term developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">The functionality of credit growth relates to demographics, including employment and population growth. For example, our population includes 1.3 million people aged from 15 to 34. On the supply side, we see mortgage growth being met by an expanded capacity in the construction sector of over 7,000 houses this year. The decrease in house price inflation is occurring because supply and demand are coming back into sync.</p>
            <p eId="para_462">People are borrowing more, but one must also examine the savings ratio which is high in Ireland. In addition, it is a function of the domestic demand in a growing economy to meet construction requirements. Those factors are all part of the dynamics of the economy. At individual level, borrowers and lenders must act sensibly, which is what they are doing. It is in the interests of banks and building societies to have good mortgage books. Nationally, we have a low debt to GDP ratio and we are in a responsible, stable position. We could have a recession with no growth in credit, but that would not be a good thing. Therefore, one must see the situation in the context of where demand is coming from, while recognising that people need to be sensible in exercising judgments. In a competitive market economy, however, people make these decisions based on a variety of products from which to choose.</p>

            <p eId="para_463">When our national debt was 120% of GDP, Ireland was seen as the economic basket-case of Europe. Is the Minister concerned that a current 160% debt rate on average income levels is unsustainable and dangerous? Some signals are needed from the Government on how this situation should be controlled.</p>

            <p eId="para_464">I have indicated to the Deputy that prudential issues in the market situation in which we find ourselves are a matter for individuals, banks and other financial institutions. Having examined the full economic picture, the Central Bank made the point that the Irish banking system is in a stable, sound position for the reasons I cited — demographics, income capacity and the supply side in terms of the construction sector. It is a function of demand in the economy and low interest rates constitute an important factor. When we came into office, the band was between 7.1% and 8.8%, while currently it is between 3.25% and 3.6%.</p>

            <p eId="para_466">When the Government's decentralisation programme was first announced, it was stated that the overall objective would be to ensure that property acquired at regional level would be matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. In November 2004, the decentralisation implementation group prepared a report on the procurement methodology and financial assessment of the property aspects of the programme, including a financial model, based on a property finance study carried out by the Office of Public Works. While the prevailing property market conditions in each area will have a bearing on cost, this model indicates that the break-even position in property will be reached in about 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">In terms of actual outlay to date, the total amount committed in principle by the OPW on site acquisition costs, excluding VAT, is approximately €35.7 million. Expenditure to date this year is €9.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">As regards non-property costs, the decentralisation programme is being implemented on a voluntary basis. There will be no redundancies and, as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">A study was commissioned by the decentralisation implementation group which provides a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised Civil Service. Decentralising organisations have been asked to use this model to make periodic reports identifying non-property costs incurred and savings made both since the programme was announced and in its implementation in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">Good progress continues to be made on this ambitious programme and I look forward to seeing the fruits of this as the programme is rolled out over the next few years.</p>

            <p eId="para_471">The Minister's early mover costs are running in the region of €47 million for sites alone. Taking the projected number of early movers it will cost approximately €12,000 per person per site. Is that not a major expense to move people from Dublin to provincial locations? Projecting that further, on the basis of the costs provided by the Minister of State and the final cost, it will cost approximately €90,000 per person to relocate people from Dublin to a provincial setting. Is that not a significant cost?</p>
            <p eId="para_472">The Minister referred to the disposal of property held in the city. To date no property has been disposed of in respect of decentralisation. Will the Minister explain why? How does he reconcile the expenditure of €47 million on purchasing sites when only one in six of the early movers is anxious to move to those locations? How can he proceed to purchase property and bring developers on site to start building offices that will cost approximately €90,000 per person when only one in six of those people has indicated he or she is prepared to move there?</p>
            <p eId="para_473">The Minister has not responded to the nub of the question, namely, how much Departments have estimated it will cost them to decentralise. No table has been produced with that information, yet IMPACT has recently asked that the Minister produce those costings on a departmental basis. Why has he not done so?</p>

            <p eId="para_476">There is no point in the Deputy doing the usual stunt in respect of a question on decentralisation. The implementation group, which knows much more about this process than anyone in this House, provided a financial model which confirms that the payback in respect of relocation can be done on a property basis over 20 years. I presume the Deputy is trying to extrapolate. He can just throw out a figure which the media will cover and we will all have to take as gospel.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_478">When all aspects are taken into account the implementation group's financial model indicates how it works out. In respect of the Deputy's one in six figure, 138 posts are due to relocate to my town, Tullamore, and 57 of those people have indicated they want to decentralise there from the relevant Department. That is not one in six. A further 33 have accepted offers of posts in Tullamore and arrangements are being made for them to transfer to the Department of Finance in the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">I am aware from media reports of the Deputy's claim regarding IMPACT but not of the assumptions underpinning the claim that it would cost €65 million a year to retain specialist staff who do not wish to relocate under the decentralisation programme. Therefore I cannot comment on that or the Deputy's claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">Duplication of staff in Dublin and the new locations is not planned. The Government has always recognised that in addition to the personnel who have applied to decentralise there is another group of equally dedicated civil and public servants who, for a range of personal or other reasons, are not in a position to relocate from Dublin. At the time of the announcement of the programme the Government made it clear that all those wishing to remain in Dublin would be offered alternative public service jobs. Arrangements will be put in place to allow staff whose jobs are being decentralised and who opt not to move out of Dublin to be assigned to other jobs in the city. That is being discussed with the trade unions concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_481">The Minister has failed to answer my question about the various Departments and he questions some of the figures I cited. I refer him to a question answered yesterday by the Minister of State, who is seated beside him, in which he said: "The cost of acquiring sites-properties for the early moving Departments is estimated to be in the region of €47 million, excluding VAT". I did not pluck the figure out of the air. It was given to my colleague yesterday and is either right or wrong. If it is right, what the Minister has said today is not correct. He cannot have it both ways. He either knows the figure or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">The total number of early movers is estimated at 4,000. If the Minister does a quick sum, he will find that I am very accurate. If he takes the figure the Minister of State gave to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, that the overall costs run up to approximately €900 million, he will see that I am not far wrong on that extrapolation.</p>
            <p eId="para_483">The Minister mentioned some areas where there are people who want to move. There are 21 early movers, 12 of which have on average fewer than 15% of people who want to move. That is where I get my one in six figure, which is a reasonable assumption.</p>

            <p eId="para_484">I will extrapolate the figures back for the Deputy to avoid confusion. I have explained the amount committed in principle on site acquisition to date, namely €35.7 million. I do not say that does not correspond to the Deputy's figure in respect of how it will be spent. On the other side of the balance sheet, however, after all the Deputy's extrapolation, is the amount of money the State gets back for those offices vacated in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_486">In his desire to give an accurate account of what it costs to move people the Deputy decided to divide a figure he knows by the number of early movers. It does not, however, cost that sum because we will dispose of the other buildings and money will come in for them. We hear a great deal from the financial spokesman in the Deputy's party about the need for models and giving credence to models. There is a model in place to which the Deputy does not refer as he puts these high figures into the public domain. The model confirms that within 20 years, this programme will pay for itself in terms of its property acquisition and release aspects. When one moves people from one Department to another, offices become vacant and have a value.</p>

        the tax measures in place regarding child care, including reliefs and exemptions for development of facilities; the changes he proposes to make in these provisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_491">The tax measures in place for child care are capital allowances on child care facilities, an exemption from a benefit-in-kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care facilities for their employees and the home carer tax credit. Child benefit is also exempt from income tax. There is a need to examine pragmatically and practically what can be done to provide child care support to parents. However, it is the long-standing practice of Ministers for Finance not to comment on what may be contained in upcoming budgets. Any changes to these or any other tax provisions will be considered in the context of the budget and Finance Bill.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_303">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_492">Does the Minister agree with the widely held view that tax reliefs and concessions are not the best way to address child care needs? Does he agree that moneys that might be spent by the State in this area in future would be better directed at the provision of universal early childhood care and education access for all three and four year olds? Does he further agree that the extension of paid maternity leave from 18 to 26 weeks would better provide for the needs of mother and child than tax reliefs? Does he agree that tax reliefs have disproportionately benefited high earners?</p>
            <p eId="para_493">In his response the Minister referred to the capital allowance for the construction of child care facilities. Is the Minister reconsidering that relief in the context of the review?</p>
            <p eId="para_494">Does he accept that very often, though not in all cases, this allowance amounts to a subsidy for those involved in the construction industry, for developers and property speculators and does not impact in a real way with regard to child care provision?</p>
            <p eId="para_495">Does the Minister agree that State money would be better spent on direct support for child care facilities for child care workers and for families with children?</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_496">I appreciate the Deputy asking specific questions, but these matters are under consideration in the context of the upcoming budget. One is much constrained by that.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">The issue is how we increase options for people and ensure a greater supply of child care places. If we do not look at the supply side of the equation, any efforts on the other side will not have the impact one would like to see. It is a question of how this can be achieved in a way that will allow us begin to add to the significant resources already made available by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">In the past we gave a significant increase in child benefit, which was a universal payment to all parents. The sum in that area comes to €1.9 billion this year. Including the equal opportunities programme and other benefits and programmes, the total spend that can be allocated to this area now, apart from anything else the Government might do, is about €2.3 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_499">I thank the Minister for his reply and I concur that the supply side is now the area of most critical importance. We are talking of quality, accessible child care. I appreciate that the Minister cannot elaborate on whether the capital allowance relief will be addressed in the Government's forthcoming package of child care measures, because I presume that is part of what he intends announcing in the budget measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">However, if it were the case that the Minister were not proposing to change this relief, accepting that the Minister will probably take a number of actions, would he consider attaching conditions, specifically putting a time limit on the capital allowance relief?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_306" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_501">I am not sure what the Deputy means regarding a time limit for the capital allowance. In 1999, a scheme of capital allowances was introduced in respect of qualifying capital expenditure incurred in the construction, refurbishment or extension of a building or part of a building used as a child care facility, where the requirements of the child care pre-school regulations 1996 have been met. An expenditure on any part of a building in use as a dwelling house or part of a dwelling house does not qualify. The allowances apply in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 and provide for a seven-year write-off period at a rate of 15% in the first six years and 10% in the seventh year. However, budget 2000 provided for accelerated capital allowances at a rate of 100% in one year for both owner-operators and lessors-investors of such facilities with regard to qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 1 December 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">With regard to timing options, an owner-operator can opt to increase the 15% allowance for any year up to a maximum of 100% of the qualifying expenditure, which is termed "free depreciation". A lessor or investor can opt to claim the full 100% in the first year only, and unlike the owner-operator, lessors have no choice regarding the percentage of allowances drawn down each year. The full 100% is claimed in year one with any excess carried forward. An owner-operator can set off the capital allowances against taxable income from all sources including PAYE income. This means that owner-operators can opt to draw down as much of the capital allowances, up to 100% in each year, as is necessary, to shelter their income from other sources. On the other hand the investor can offset the 100% initial allowances against rental income from all sources and not just the rental income received from the child care facility operators in year one. If there is insufficient rental income in that year, the maximum an investor can offset against non-rental income is €31,750. The balance of unused capital allowances can only be set off against rental income in the following years.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">Capital allowance for child care facilities is one of the many reliefs under detailed review by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners. The final report by the consultants has been received and will be taken into consideration in the 2006 budget and finance Bill.</p>

        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
        if he will report on the 8 November 2005 ECOFIN meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_307" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_505">I attended the ECOFIN Council meeting in Brussels on 8 November 2005. This meeting was attended by Ministers of Finance of all 25 EU member states and of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">The Council held a debate on Council conclusions on means of establishing an improved control framework for the EU budget on the basis of work carried out by a group of member state experts convened by the Commission and co-chaired by the Presidency. Council adopted Presidency conclusions on the Commission's proposal for a roadmap to an integrated internal control framework for the EU budget, setting out proposals for the harmonisation of principles of controls and for the simplification of legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The Council adopted conclusions on the introduction of a common EU methodology to measure administrative burdens, which burdens are the costs imposed by legal obligations to provide information. The introduction of this initiative will assist the EU Commission in measuring the costs imposed by EU legislation and will complement other initiatives taken in the area of better regulation, such as the screening of regulatory proposals, the simplification of existing legislation and impact assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">With regard to EU statistical governance, the Council adopted conclusions, including measures to be taken in order to improve the quality of statistical data to be used in the assessment of member states' budgetary situations. These conclusions support the creation of a new high-level advisory body to enhance EUROSTAT independence and governance. Ireland's National Statistics Board has worked well in a similar role vis-à-vis the Central Statistics Office. I welcome the ongoing review of EU statistical priorities. In a rapidly changing world, it is vital to make sure that the information produced by statisticians matches the information needed by policy makers.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">The Council adopted the decision under Article 104(8) of the treaty, which points to Hungary's failure to correct its excessive deficit below the reference value of 3% of GDP by 2008. The Council will closely monitor Hungary's progress in dealing with this issue on the basis of reports from the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">The UK Presidency presented a report to Council on progress on proposals aimed at simplifying cross-border business obligations relating to value-added tax, and on future handling of the dossier by the UK and Austrian presidencies. The proposals are intended to ease VAT compliance for businesses. The proposals consist of a draft directive amending a previous directive with a view to simplifying VAT obligations, a draft directive laying down detailed rules for the refund of VAT to businesses in member states where it has no base, and a draft regulation amending a previous regulation as regards administrative co-operation under the "one-stop" scheme and the refund procedure for VAT. The Council noted the progress made and also the need for further work on the dossier during the UK Presidency and the forthcoming Austrian Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">Council discussed the main issues to be resolved in order that agreement be reached before the end of the year on modifications to EU rules regarding reduced rates of value-added tax applied by the member states. Council agreed to return to this in December. While Ireland is prepared to contribute to further work in the area, we will continue to protect our zero and reduced rated items. The structure of VAT rates is a sensitive political issue for certain member states who can face costly consequences from pressures to reduce particular rates of VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">The Commission presented three papers on cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the financial services sector: a communication on intra-EU investment in the financial services sector, a working document on cross-border consolidation and a working paper on review of article 16 of directive 2000/12/EC. Presidency conclusions were agreed supporting the continuation of the Commission's work in reviewing the obstacles to cross-border consolidation in the financial services sector and the issue will be further discussed at future ECOFINs.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">Council was briefed on the financial consequences of the reform of the EU's common market organisation in the sugar sector that has been proposed by the Commission. The issue of funding for the action plan to aid African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the restructuring package for member states was discussed in this context. There were no conclusions.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">The annual meeting between members of ECOFIN and members of the European free trade area took place at lunch time. The topic for discussion at this year's lunch was employment and growth in the context of globalisation.</p>

          <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_308">
            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_516">I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome him back to the House. The detail in the answer makes a welcome change to the previous lack of openness that accompanied ECOFIN meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">Will the Minister say what position he adopted at yesterday's meetings in regard to a number of agenda items? He mentioned the discussion on the new VAT directive. This was on foot of a decision made in 2002, when nine of the then 15 countries decided to adopt the lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive industries, and Ireland chose not to. The Minister might say why that was, and whether Ireland is still of the same opinion.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">It was also reported before the ECOFIN meeting that Commissioner McCreevy was meant to be in attendance to outline obstacles which he says exist with regard to difficulties in banks being able to merge. Does the Minister agree with the Commissioner or does he think measures need to be taken to protect the very limited Irish input which exists in the ownership of financial institutions? How would they be affected by any new proposals coming from Mr. McCreevy's office? With regard to reports issued before the meeting on the possibility that a number of countries would use the enhanced co-operation mechanism for a shared approach to corporation tax, was that discussed at the meeting and does the Minister share the reluctance of most parties in this House to go down that road in a collective European Union sense?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_309" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_519">We have economic and tax models which have ensured our unemployment rate stands at half the EU average and our growth rate is more than 2.5 times the euro zone average. These models include low taxes on employment and enterprise and different indirect taxation levels. It is a question of how a tax system is structured.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">The one-stop scheme idea concerns business consumer and Internet type businesses and the operation of a VAT regime in which businesses do not have to register for VAT in respect of each country in which they trade. Common rules are being devised which would enable such a system to work more efficiently and the benefits of this proposal may be seen for people operating such businesses in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">Discussions took place to reach agreement before the end of the year on modifications to EU rules on the reduced rates of VAT applied by member states. The Council agreed to return to this issue in December. We are prepared to contribute further to work on the area and will continue to protect our zero and reduced rate items. When this dossier came before us in the past, efforts were made to reach a compromise based on losing a zero VAT rate, of which we are not in favour. The compromise proposal that has emerged under the UK Presidency seems to protect our position in that regard and, therefore, our disposition towards it has changed. We are now prepared to work further to determine whether a consensus may be built around the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">On the financial services issue and cross-border consolidation in the EU financial sector, the Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, was present for that part of the meeting and outlined the Commission's position. Three papers were presented on cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the financial services sector, namely, a communication on intra-EU investment in the financial services sector, a working document on cross-border consolidation and a working paper on the review of Article 16 of EU Directive 2000/12/EC. Presidency conclusions were agreed with regard to supporting the continuation of the Commission's work on reviewing the obstacles to cross-border consolidation in the financial services sector and the issue will be further discussed at future ECOFIN meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">I believe in ensuring that an internal market on financial services will be of benefit to us. The more the Single Market integrates, the greater the experience for Ireland. The financial services industry in Ireland will function more effectively if obstacles do not get in the way of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Ireland has experienced six takeovers of banks by international players such as Skanska, Rabo and Bank of Scotland. This results in increased competition, improved products and better deals for consumers, and the more we are open to it, the better. While we all share the desire to see that the headquarters of major Irish banks are retained in Ireland, we must ensure that Ireland continues to have a strong banking system. Competition has had a positive impact and an internal market in financial services is in the interest of this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_524">During the course of the ECOFIN meeting, did Ministers have opportunities to discuss, formally or otherwise, the prospect of rising interest rates in Europe and, in particular, the problem that such a situation poses for economies such as Ireland's, where there are high levels of personal indebtedness and mortgage debt? A 1% interest rate increase over the next year will have disastrous implications for the personal budgets of many young families, for example, in the case of couples with 100% mortgages costing €600,000.</p>

While that figure varies significantly from our experience, it is to be expected of the euro area. Unless evidence is found of second round effects with regard to recent oil prices, that recovery will hopefully be taken into account when the central bank considers this issue. I do not want to say anything that might suggest there will be any change to the current situation of extreme vigilance by the Governor of the ECB.</p>

        the level of repayments to taxpayers in each of the past three years and to date in 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_532">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of reviews of tax liability sought by PAYE taxpayers in the past three years which resulted in refunds are as follows: as of 23 September 2005, there were 322,361 such reviews and the amount refunded was €282 million; in 2004, there were 350,016 reviews and refunds of €278 million; in 2003, there were 314,298 reviews and refunds of €265 million; and in 2002, there were 304,272 such reviews. The amount refunded in 2002 is not immediately to hand but I will revert to the Deputy with the information as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">PAYE is a tax collection system which was designed to collect an employee's tax liability for a year on a cumulative basis over the year. The correct amount of tax can only be collected where the employee has claimed and been granted in the annual notice of tax credits and standard rate cut-off points all the reliefs to which he or she is entitled. Revenue can only allow tax credits or reliefs on the basis of the information that is known to them. If the information on the tax credit certificate is incorrect or incomplete because of inadequate information received from the taxpayer or if there is a change in circumstances in the course of the tax year which is not notified to Revenue, the system will not operate as intended and the tax deducted will be incorrect.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">The vast majority of taxpayers are conscious of the credits and reliefs they are entitled to and, where claims are necessary, take the required action. Revenue makes every effort possible to inform taxpayers of their entitlements and, where additional tax credits are claimed, the necessary adjustments in the taxpayer's affairs are speedily made.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">Some reliefs need not be claimed as they are given at source, for example, pension contributions, permanent health insurance, medical insurance and mortgage interest. Others need only be claimed once as they will remain constant in the taxpayer's profile over the year, for example, basic tax credits, PAYE credit and trade union subscriptions. In this instance, once claimed, the reliefs are automatically carried forward from year to year. The only reliefs that need to be claimed on an ongoing basis are those that are expenditure related, such as medical expenses relief. Such claims give rise to the greater part of repayments of tax since the relief cannot be quantified until after the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">Revenue is already very proactive in the manner in which it ensures that PAYE taxpayers are made aware of their entitlements and facilitated in claiming these. Revenue keeps this issue under constant review and takes whatever steps are necessary with regard to public information campaigns to continue to inform taxpayers of their entitlements and to simplify, as far as possible, the arrangements for making these claims. The upcoming bulk issue of more than €2.2 million in tax credit certificates for 2006 will be the focus of an information campaign, as will the roll-out of the PAYE on-line system in early 2006. I emphasise, however, that the primary responsibility for ensuring that Revenue has the most up-to-date information on a taxpayer's affairs lies with the taxpayer.</p>

            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_537">I thank the Minister for his reply. His figures suggest that one in five people obtain a tax review and, on average, receive a €750 refund. While I do not suggest that the remaining four out of every five would receive a similar refund, has the Minister looked hard at the take-up on various reliefs where there is likely to be under-claiming?</p>
            <p eId="para_538">I have conducted a calculation exercise, without the resources available to the Minister, on the back of an envelope, so to speak. I estimate that on DIRT, approximately 5% of the refund is taken up, that is, only 5% of those eligible for a refund obtain one. These are mostly elderly people with deposit accounts. On bin charges, according to figures from the Department of Finance, approximately 15% of the relief is taken up. On medical expenses, using Central Statistics Office data on how much people spend on medical care, the take-up is approximately 20%. On rent, the take-up is around 40%. The take-up of relief rises for home carers, where the figure is approximately 75%. In this context, at least €350 million per annum of taxpayers' money is not getting back to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">I accept that the Revenue Commissioners produce information leaflets but will the Minister charge Revenue with completing a statistical exercise to estimate how much tax relief is being taken up and how much is not? Let us obtain some hard data in this area. I believe the figures I have come up with are not very far wide of the mark and if that is the case, then over a four-year period where a look-back is possible, we are talking about €1.2 billion to €1.5 billion of taxpayers' money that is not being returned to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">Everyone wants to see a fair tax code where people who are well off pay their way. The other side of that coin is that we want to see those who deserve it getting their money back. Will the Minister take more of an interest in returning this money to taxpayers instead of simply reciting the fact that the Revenue Commissioners do certain things and the obligation is on the taxpayer? Let us do something to return the money to where it belongs.</p>

What I have calculated is based on CSO estimates of how much is spent on out-of-pocket medical expenses and on what we know of bin charges through the local authorities. It is also based on what we know of the number of people who claim DIRT refunds. Only 1,000 people claimed DIRT refunds while there are 36,000 people on the small income exemption limit. Clearly, there is under-claiming. I do not have a monopoly in this area. I can forward my data to the Minister, but they are back-of-an-envelope in nature.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
            <p eId="para_551">There are no plans to undertake any major conservation work at Doe Castle, County Donegal. A comprehensive programme of conservation work was undertaken at the castle during the period 1996 to 2001. This involved a major restoration of the medieval tower house to provide a suitable indoor location on the site for the important MacSweeney grave slab. All works carried out in the intervening period have been of a routine, maintenance nature.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_328">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_552">I thank the Minister of State for his reply but am disappointed with his negative response. I do not know how familiar he is with Irish history but Doe Castle has been associated with many major events over the past 400 or 500 years. It was built in the early 1500s. Red Hugh O'Donnell, who was one of the most important people to come from Donegal and was known as the fighting prince of Donegal, was fostered there. When the Spanish Armada was wrecked in 1588, survivors of the disaster found shelter and protection in Doe Castle. Owen Roe O'Neill, on his return from Spain in 1641, landed at Doe Castle and began his conquest of Ulster from there. When one takes all of these things into consideration, the castle is probably the most historic building surviving in Donegal, if not in Ireland. There is one major investment required, to re-roof the great hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">Doe Castle is already a great tourist attraction. Approximately 5,000 people per month visit the castle, the seat of the MacSweeney family, during the summer season. If the castle were re-roofed, there would be a triangle of attractions in the area, namely Doe Castle itself, the Glenveagh Estate, in which the State has invested heavily and which attracts 100,000 visitors per annum, and the Glebe Gallery, bequeathed by Derek Hill. If the main hall of the castle were re-roofed, it would generate enough finances to make the castle self-sufficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">I urge the Minister of State to have a sympathetic look at this project. In two year's time we will commemorate the Flight of the Earls. The year 2007 is the fourth centenary of that event. The earls did not leave Doe Castle but the nearby village of Rathmullan and while the main celebrations will be in Rathmullan in 2007, there is no reason we should not have a banquet to mark the departure of the earls in Doe Castle. That can only be done, however, if the great hall is re-roofed. I urge the Minister of State and the Minister to provide funding of €200,000 to complete the job. I would then welcome them both to the official opening, even if nobody else in the House would do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_560">I agree with Deputy McGinley that Doe Castle has a fine history. The castle has been vacant since 1890. The Land Commission took it over in 1932 and the Office of Public Works took charge of it in July 1934. The national monuments section of the OPW undertook an extensive programme of conservation work on the site, including a major restoration of the medieval tower house which is the primary structure associated with the castle, and the conservation of the MacSweeney grave slab. This programme of work was completed in 2001. The medieval tower was roofed with Irish oak and stone slates. Oak floors were fitted along with an oak staircase which provides access to the upper levels of the castle. A key holder allows visitors to access the castle.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Deputy McGinley referred to the fact that Doe Castle receives 5,000 visitors per month, although I am not sure if his figures are correct. Donegal Castle has approximately 50,000 visitors per annum and Glenveagh is also a major tourist attraction in the area. There is no further funding available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. If the provision of further facilities are to be considered, it would be a matter for the successor of the NDP and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am sure the Deputy will make a case to him in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">The Deputy will be aware that the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, recommends candidates to Government for the most senior appointments in the Civil Service. Subject to certain exceptions, TLAC deals with all posts at or above assistant secretary level or equivalent across the Civil Service. The Government is the appointing authority for posts at secretary general level and the TLAC recommends up to three candidates, if found suitable, for posts at this level. The Government appoints the secretary general from among the recommended candidates. In the case of posts below secretary general level, for example, assistant secretary posts, the appropriate Minister is the appointing authority and one candidate is recommended by TLAC to the Minister for appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">Some 70 TLAC competitions were run over the past five years, 14 of which were at secretary general level and 56 were at assistant secretary level and equivalent. No post was filled by a person from outside the Civil Service in the past five years, even though two posts were filled by open competition rather than by competition among eligible officers across the Civil Service. Some 13 posts, including four at secretary general level, were filled by people from outside the Department where the vacancy occurred.</p>

            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_567">I thank the Minister for his reply. I note that recently the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department indicated that there was a need to bring in more expertise into the senior levels of the public service. Against that background, the Minister revealed that out of 70 competitions, just two were open competitions, neither of which produced anyone from outside the Civil Service. Does the Minister think there is a need to change the practice of recruitment so that more outsiders will begin to come into positions in the public service? Surely it is long past the time when we rely exclusively on home grown talent to come up through the ranks. If there is expertise and talent outside, the public service should avail of it. I recognise that the morale of people who wish to apply for these posts is at stake and everyone should have a fair chance, but zero out of 70 posts is an extraordinarily low and unacceptable percentage.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">Does the Minister believe there needs to be more progress in opening up competition generally. Even 13 of the 70 coming from outside the sponsoring Department is an unacceptably low figure. We ought to have professionalisation of the Civil Service where skills in financial management or human resource management can be transferred between Departments. This silo approach to Departments is not acceptable. Will the Minister take up the suggestion of the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department and initiate a serious programme of reform in this area so that we will begin to see new talent in crucial areas? Clearly project management skills within the public service are seriously depleted relative to the task that must be addressed.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_569">I recently said that there is a need to open up opportunities from the private sector to the public sector in many specialised and technical areas. There is also provision in the social partnership programme for open competition in these areas. In fairness, there is much churning within Departments. By the time people get to assistant secretary level, they may have served in two or three other Departments. They may have come in at principal officer level to that Department, therefore, the Deputy is not getting the full story in the reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">Making positions available for open competition is a matter for TLAC. The senior civil servant referred to, who is a senior member of TLAC, indicated that the body is open to considering, consistent with the maintenance of morale and the expertise available within the service, how there might be some cross-fertilisation with the private sector. Contracting out to the private sector should be engaged in to a much greater extent. Exchange programmes should be taking place in technical areas as well as in the wider policy formulation, administrative and commercial areas. Civil servants who have come back into the system following a degree of knowledge and practice in the commercial world would have more experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">This is an area in which we must be creative and innovative, consistent with acknowledging and giving opportunities to those in the system who are providing a good service and who would be suitable for senior positions.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Cooper-Flynn — to discuss the announcement by the Minister in connection with the western rail corridor; (2) Deputy Wall — to ask the Minister if his attention has been drawn to the problems facing the employees of companies (details supplied) in County Kildare; (3) Deputy Healy — the need for the Minister to designate south Tipperary and the south-east region category one status under the European Union regional aid for 2007-13; (4) Deputy McHugh — the plans to sell Health Service Executive lands at Tuam, Ballinasloe and Portumna, County Galway; (5) Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin — the reason for the reduction of 100,000 home help hours in County Kerry between 2002 and 2004; (6) Deputy Keaveney — that the Minister discuss with her counterpart in the North issues of changing the fees structure for students from the republic attending courses in Northern Ireland; (7) Deputy Costello — the action he proposes in response to the request by the Czech Republic for the arrest and extradition of two of its nationals; (8) Deputy Crawford — to ask the Minister to ensure that transport is provided for 17 children in the Latton area of County Monaghan attending Ballybay Community College; (9) Deputy Timmins — the need for the establishment of first responder schemes on a countrywide basis giving communities access to defibrillators; (10) Deputy Allen — the decision by the Department to withdraw fuel allowance worth €12.90 per week from old age pensioner recipients; and (11) Deputy Ó Caoláin — the need for the Minister to undertake a review of road safety in the Border counties.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_575">I will pick up where I concluded. I welcomed the report and asked that everyone take it seriously. I also made the point that this debate is about fairness, but there are many other issues which must be dealt with and I hope that, in time, the discussion can be broadened.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I noticed a statement during the week by a constituent of mine and former vice president of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Michael Stokes, that in the unusually direct intervention by the State in church matters, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, told the Dáil that the law of the land applies to all, irrespective of their status. When announcing the decision to hold an inquiry into clerical sex abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin, the Taoiseach described child sexual abuse as abhorrent. I make that point because so far in the debate there has been a little bit of church-bashing. I believe we should remain focused. I made the point this morning that many churchmen throughout the State who are still doing their job deserve our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">However, I support fully those who have been abused and hurt. It is important to help and seek out people who have not yet sought redress. In that regard, like other colleagues, I received correspondence in recent days from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The document is entitled Another Brick From the Wall, which seeks the introduction of mandatory reporting of child abuse and neglect in Ireland. It is important for all of us to take account of that document. We should support those who look after children. As I said this morning, the children of the nation deserve our strong support. Many vile acts were unaccounted for over a long period. Much of what we are discussing happened during other decades but it is important to ensure that nothing we would be ashamed of in the future is going on behind closed doors today. I would hate to look back in a number of years and discover the abuse was still taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">It is important to have this debate and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_579">The recent publication of the report of the Ferns Inquiry brought to an end the work of Mr. Justice Francis Murphy, Dr. Helen Buckley and Dr. Laraine Joyce. This inquiry has brought to light a litany of child sexual abuse, failure on the part of the church authorities and inaction from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Reading the report was sickening, disgusting and often horrifying, and that was before one concentrated one's mind on the fact that it happened in this country in relatively recent times and that the victims were disbelieved, afraid to tell what happened because of the power the abuser held over them or just too terrified to speak out. Those who did speak out were clearly often ignored or, in some instances, treated as if it was they who were in the wrong. What happened caused deep rifts and divisions in communities and, sadly, in families.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The Ferns Inquiry has confirmed that the response of the church to incidences of child sexual abuse was appallingly inappropriate. In transferring those responsible for the abuse of children from one role to another within the diocese or outside the diocese, the church prioritised its need to maintain secrecy with regard to what was happening to the child. Simply put, this amounted to an institutional disregard for the needs of children and young people by those in whom the public had placed the utmost trust. This must never be allowed to happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The recently announced establishment of a new inquiry to focus on child sexual abuse in the Dublin diocese will also result in the publication of a shocking and disturbing litany of abuse, neglect and inaction. I welcome this inquiry, coming as it does seven and a half years after Andrew Madden, himself a victim of child sexual abuse, first wrote to the Taoiseach seeking such an inquiry. The response at the time from his private secretary was that it would not be appropriate, that difficulties lay in the impracticality of such a tribunal and that the Catholic Church was not a public body. I am glad to note we are a little more enlightened now and at least willing to look into these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">We cannot simply shake our heads, wring our hands and wait for the next damning report on this matter. What we must do, as well as ensuring that the response from the church authorities to incidences of abuse places the needs of the child first, is guarantee that the responsibility of the State to protect all children, young people and the vulnerable of any age is met.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">It is clear that the primary responsibility for the protection of children lies with the State. The Ferns Report shows that the State, through its responsible agencies, has failed time and again to meet that responsibility and vindicate child safety. We all know that the child protection procedures are deeply inadequate and the Ferns Report confirms this knowledge in sad and shocking detail. If the report is to mean anything, there must be action and change. The report's recommendations are detailed, thoughtful and, if implemented, would considerably enhance the level of protection afforded to children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">There are a number of key actions the Government should take to ensure that the type of abuse at Ferns can never happen again. The legislation to establish a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children should be prioritised. This has been promised since I entered the House and yet it has languished in section C of the legislative programme with no publication date indicated. This legislation should be published before the end of this Dáil session. All co-operation will be given by Fine Gael and, I am sure, by our colleagues to ensure the legislation is passed without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">While the vetting unit is to be expanded after much delay, this will not address the concerns of the Ferns Report unless all members of school boards of management are subject to vetting. The Ferns Report stated clearly that "some priests appear to have abused their position as managers of national schools in order to access children". The same checks should apply to board of management members as do to teachers and other staff at schools, irrespective of who is responsible for making these appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The Minister for Education and Science appears to be equivocating on this issue. That is unacceptable. The Minister is linking boards of management with the voluntary sector and calling it a "wider issue". She appears to be completely unaware that the voluntary sector has been demanding access to vetting arrangements for many years. I met the National Youth Council this morning and it confirmed this. For the Government to suggest that expanding vetting arrangements will damage the voluntary sector, as the Minister for Education and Science did yesterday, is simply misinformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I cannot stress too much the importance of having all people working with children, whether in a paid or voluntary capacity, vetted for their suitability. Surely the Government is not suggesting that it is only those in paid employment who are likely to pose a risk to children? Any gap left in our vetting arrangements will be exploited by those seeking access to children for the purpose of abusing them. It is clear from the Ferns Report that priests used their positions on boards of management to access children. This is an issue the report highlighted as needing to be addressed. The proper implementation of the Ferns Report does not allow us the privilege of picking and choosing or implementing only the easy parts. It must be implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The gathering of so-called soft information is critical in the fight against those who seek to abuse children. It is notoriously difficult to secure convictions in cases of child sexual abuse, with some agencies estimating that only one in 20 cases results in a prosecution. We must remember that Ian Huntley, the person responsible for the murder of schoolgirls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, was given a job at a school even though in the late 1990s he was repeatedly questioned on charges relating to sexual activity with minors, indecent assault, burglary and rape. In 1998 and 1999 alone he was questioned in four separate rape investigations. There is no way that such a person should have been able to get work at a school, and the gathering of soft, non-conviction information is vital to ensure that such a case does not arise in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The concept of the use of soft information is also highlighted in this report. It quotes examples from Irish case law in this area, when dealing with the limitations of current legislation, particularly as it relates to health boards. Two separate cases in 1997 deal extensively with this point. In MQ <i> v. </i>Robert Gleeson and Others, Mr. Justice Barr effectively allowed soft information to be passed on by the health board to the VEC to prevent a person working in a school. He made an interesting distinction between the role of the health board and the police, as he called them, and the DPP saying that the health boards’ emphasis is on “the protection of vulnerable children” while the latter’s emphasis is on “the detention and conviction of child abusers”. He then said, and it is worth quoting in full:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_591">There are many circumstances which indicate that a particular person is likely to be (or have been) a child abuser, but there is insufficient evidence to establish such abuse in accordance with the standards of proof required in a criminal or civil trial. However, there may be sufficient evidence to create, after reasonable investigation, a significant doubt in the minds of competent experienced Health Board or related professional personnel that there has been abuse by a particular person. If such has been established then it follows that a Health Board cannot stand idly by but has an obligation to take appropriate action[.]</p>
          <p eId="para_592">This is very much an implied right and duty to communicate, as the Ferns Report clearly points out, and it is our duty in this Chamber to make this an explicit piece of law. Any delay in doing so is the same as turning our backs yet again on people at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The idea of non-conviction information was again mentioned by Mr. Justice Hamilton in re Article 26 in the Employment Equality Bill where he said that there was nothing in the Bill to require an employer to employ someone who had a criminal conviction for sexual behaviour or, and this is the key point, "anything that was considered on the basis of reliable information that he engages in or has a propensity to engage in unlawful sexual behaviour". He based this firmly on the need to protect children.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Unfortunately, this does not give a clear indication as to what one can rely on as reliable information and again points to our duty to act to ensure this type of information can be used to protect children. The report shows that in 1998 the assistant Garda commissioner had to seek the Attorney General's advice on whether it was the Garda or health boards who should inform employers or family members where rumour or innuendo exists. The response was that the principal avenue should be the health board. However, there is no legislative framework through which this can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Other legislative changes recommended by the working group on vetting must be acted upon. The amendment of the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 and the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to include the reporting of abuse of vulnerable adults and offer a greater degree of protection to those with physical disabilities respectively should be brought forward now. The legislative changes recommended in the Ferns Report, namely, the creation of an offence of reckless endangerment with regard to the welfare of a child, should be prioritised. An audit of practices in all dioceses around the country should be commenced and concluded without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The stay safe programme should be available in all schools. It is not acceptable that up to one in five primary schools do not offer this subject, which should be mandatory. If some parents wish to remove their children from this subject, so be it, but that must not mean that all other children in the school cannot benefit from the programme. The priority in this programme is the protection of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The Minister for Education and Science, in a reply to a question from me on this issue yesterday, said that she would strongly encourage all schools to use the stay safe programme. Unfortunately, it is clear that encouragement in the past has not been sufficient. If it is a priority for her Department, as she claims, surely she should make it mandatory on all schools to implement it. The programme is designed to give children the skills they need to recognise and resist abuse and teaches them how to tell an adult what is happening. Surely this must be available to every child in the country. The Minister needs to revisit this issue and demand its implementation in every school.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Fine Gael has already published detailed proposals on how information can be gathered and how our vetting procedures can be significantly improved. Vetting a prospective employee or volunteer through the system proposed by Fine Gael would show whether the prospective employee or volunteer had a criminal record and, if so, to what crime such a record related, any relevant non-conviction information, and whether a school principal, vice-principal or chairperson of a school board of management had made a recommendation to the central vetting unit that the prospective employee or volunteer should not be employed to work with children or vulnerable adults and the reasons for this recommendation. The same would apply to the HSE CEO, director of service or line manager and the chief executive officer or director of a charity, voluntary, sporting or youth organisation. Utilising this system a complete database of both criminal conviction information and soft information would exist for the most comprehensive vetting possible. We have outlined clear appeal procedures to ensure that natural justice is respected. An examination of the Ferns Report shows in horrifying detail the abuse suffered by so many children in that part of the country. Unfortunately there is no reason to suspect that this abuse was not replicated to a greater or lesser extent in other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">If the Ferns Report is to mean anything it must result in immediate action and change. I call on the Minister of State present and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to ensure the report is referred to a combined meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Education and Science. I would not like to see blame passed from one committee to the other. Joint hearings are imperative on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#FionnaOMalleyPD" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Ms F. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_600">The Ferns Report teaches us much. It is essentially a damning chronicle of the appalling abuses of the most depraved kind inflicted on young children by priests who held positions of trust and authority in communities. It chronicles the wholly inadequate and thoroughly reprehensible response by the church to abuses when it was informed of them. It highlights the inner workings of the church and how it felt itself above or separate from the laws of the State. It also points to the collusion on the part of the State authorities that allowed this misapprehension develop; that the church was above reproach.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The State's failure to pursue priests for sex crimes against children over many years is truly shameful. It is evidence of the all too cosy relationship that has existed between the church and the State. I believe this relationship persists to this day, and if we are to act on the lessons from the Ferns Report it is a relationship which must be dismantled thoroughly.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Preservation and protection of the church was the primary concern of the hierarchy when the abuses became apparent. For an association or institution which purports to offer moral and spiritual guidance, the response of the church to the allegations of sexual abuse against members of its community was wholly morally bankrupt. It promoted and transferred paedophile priests, permitting them to continue their vile practice unchecked and it sidelined honourable priests who sought to have the matter addressed. Many honourable members of the church are as appalled as the general public by the tolerance on the part of the hierarchy or the institution of the church of the perpetrators of such evil sex crimes. These are people who are in danger of being isolated further from communities in which they have made a positive contribution because of a tendency of tarring all with the same brush. The hierarchy has let these honourable members down badly by its failure to bring errant members to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Had the same efficiency with which Bishop Comiskey and others sought insurance to indemnify themselves against claims of sexual abuse in 1989 been applied to rooting out the cancer which was left to fester within the clergy, many children would not have suffered the pain and trauma of violation by people whom their parents and community revered. This is what is so reprehensible. Back then children were not believed, given the status of the priest in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The Ferns Report is interesting also on the question of Canon Law versus State civil and criminal law and how the church places itself somewhat outside or above the laws which govern our nation. The early part of the report documents how the hierarchy grappled with the tensions between these sets of rules to which they were bound. The first code of Canon Law dealt with, amongst other things, how priests who abused children were to be treated. The report noted, "a high degree of secrecy was imposed on all church officials involved in such cases. The penalty for breach of this secrecy was automatic excommunication...". This is totally at odds with our criminal code. The conduct of the hierarchy in dealing with sex abuse allegations demonstrates that its loyalty was first and foremost to its own code of Canon Law. The laws of the State came a poor second and the consequence was the appalling abuse of innocent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The report, if it were needed, should demonstrate to the Catholic Church or any church or organisation that its own code of conduct is subject to national law and it is by those standards alone that one's conduct will be judged. Only time will tell whether this report represents a crossing the Rubicon. Can we confidently claim that the horror and pain inflicted by priests will never happen again? If we are to make such a bold claim our response to this report will make all the difference. This response will require many changes. Chief among them is the level of influence the church still enjoys in our schools. The Ferns Report notes the easy access depraved priests had to a steady supply of children through schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Mary Raftery, who has done invaluable service to Irish society by her persistence in exposing institutional abuses in Ireland, has raised this issue recently in <i>The Irish Times</i>. She has highlighted that more than 95% of national schools are directly managed by the Catholic Church. Often priests will control the boards of management. Fr. Seán Fortune chaired such a board while he conducted his sex crimes. Can we in all faith continue to leave the care of children in the education system in the hands of an institution which has shown itself to be wholly inadequate in its response to the safety of children when abuse was identified?</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Equally, we have seen recent scandalous attempts by the Catholic Church to interfere with clinical trials for cancer patents in the Mater and St. Vincent's hospitals. There is the ongoing objection of CURA volunteers to disseminating the Positive Options leaflet on behalf of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which is a State agency. In a referendum the people indicated they wanted information on all options to be disseminated. This leaflet documents all options facing a woman with a crisis pregnancy. This objection continues despite an agreement entered into by the bishops on behalf of CURA to do so. The agreement is worth more than €650,000 to CURA. These instances point to an all too powerful influence on our society by the Catholic Church. Such an influence has no place in a republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">A survey conducted last year by the Department of Education and Science, the most comprehensive survey of the Irish people's views on education matters since 1960, backs up this opinion. The majority agreed with the proposition that schools should not be denominational, although they should provide for some religious instruction. It is time we as politicians for a pluralist republic provided this option for our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I commend the work Mr. Justice Murphy, Dr. Helen Buckley and Dr. Laraine Joyce have done on our behalf. They operated under particularly difficult circumstances in that it was not a sworn inquiry. Despite its stomach-turning contents it represents something of a catharsis in the State's role and responsibilities and those of the church in finally confronting clerical sexual abuse. I hope the church will get the message clearly that it no longer has an ally in the State if it is seeking to cover up sex crimes.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_610">As a Deputy for Wexford, I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in this important debate. No document in my memory has caused more concern anguish and debate in my county than the Ferns Report. Since its publication two weeks ago it has rightly dominated public conversation and public discourse. It has caused the entire community to reflect on itself. It has required each of us in the community to examine how such terrible things could have taken place and how it could have continued for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I do not believe that Wexford is especially evil — I know better than that. I know of the thousands of good, decent and honourable people who live there and of the good and decent priests and religious.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">However, awful things did happen in my community, the details of which, unvarnished and brutal, are laid out in the Ferns Report. It shames us all that it happened in our midst and that society went on as normal with such hurt and evil flowing freely beneath the surface.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I listened yesterday to Colm O'Gorman, a voice of calm, sanity and reason from a man who endured much pain. He has played a pivotal role in exposing the truth. His approach is not vengeful, but hopeful and positive. The process of shining light into dark crevices is, and will continue to be, painful, but one lesson above all must be learned. All of us must listen and must believe. We have a great deal more listening to do. Some voices want now to move on, to close the debate as if we have heard enough. This cannot happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The first responsibility for all of us is to give space to the victims who at last have had their experiences told and believed. Others will be given strength by their courage and they too must be allowed a voice. It may take time, but we must construct an ongoing system to allow that process to unfold. We must also ensure our child protection systems are robust beyond doubt. I remember well the long debate in this House on the Child Care Act in the early 1990s. After the publication of the Kilkenny incest case, I was able, as the then Minister for Health, to resource that important legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Deputy Twomey, my constituency colleague, mentioned the beginnings of change in the aftermath of the Kilkenny report, when there were resources at ground level to deal with, recognise and accept there were such awful issues as child abuse. They were not only real, but in many cases all too rampant. There are now new and clear recommendations in this report upon which we must act.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">In the fog of debate about canon versus State law there must be no doubt that the State has the prime responsibility to protect all its citizens, especially its children. There can be no ambiguity about the responsibility of all citizens, lay or religious, to apply State law and to assist, without reservation, in the investigation of crime. Like most crimes of violence, what is clear from the cases so graphically set out in this report is the abuse of power. The Catholic Church, for so long the most powerful institution in the State, abused its power. While the prime responsibility lies with the perpetrators of these awful criminal acts, what is revealed is a powerful institution incapable or unwilling to deal with the terrible truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The response of Bishops Donal Herlihy and Brendan Comiskey is spelled out in detail in the report. While to judge the actions of people up to 40 years ago through the prism of today's state of knowledge and understanding can produce a false result, the failure to act effectively when knowledge was received beggars belief. What emerges is a parallel world where the church, its institutions and its priests exist in a separate world of accountability and responsibility. All of us allowed that parallel universe to exist and that level of power to be exercised. This must end now. There must be one standard applied universally in the Republic, through which all citizens will be afforded the same rights and have identical responsibilities. This is the position now accepted in the diocese of Ferns. It must apply everywhere in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The actions of Bishop Eamonn Walsh, since he became apostolic administrator of the diocese of Ferns in May 2002, are commended by the inquiry team. The inquiry team points out that the procedures adopted by Bishop Walsh should be incorporated into the organisation and management of the diocese. That should apply not just to the diocese of Ferns but to all dioceses. However, I point out again that the State must determine proper procedures to be applied throughout the State by all its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">In the days and weeks ahead, there will be scope to deal with many of the deep issues raised by some of the early speakers in this debate, for example, the position of the church — all churches — in influencing State policy and the role of the church in education. This debate is timely and must come soon. Today, however, we should deal with the report before us and its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">One recommendation is the institution of a new criminal offence relating to engaging in conduct that creates a substantive risk of bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child, or failing to take reasonable steps to alleviate such a risk. I welcome the Government's commitment to incorporate an amendment into the Criminal Justice Bill currently before the House to act swiftly to make this the law of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">We have had much debate on Garda vetting procedures, but they are still woefully inadequate. Many organisations dealing with children are begging for supports to enable them to ensure the children in their care are protected. Whatever resources and systems are required to do this must be provided without delay. New barring orders that will allow the HSE to apply to the courts to protect children from people with a propensity to abuse must be swiftly enacted into law. We must also conclude our debate on mandatory reporting. People have differing views on this, because there is a concern that it may prevent some reporting of awful crime. The position enunciated by the Minister of State in his opening remarks is wholly unsustainable, namely, that he wishes to have mandatory reporting without any law to provide for it. I hope he will act swiftly on all these issues of debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Much soul searching has gone on and is going on in County Wexford. It is inevitable that other communities will face the same issues in the future, as further necessary inquiries reveal our painful past. We must ensure it is the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">For many young people, the Ireland of the 1970s and 1980s is an unknown land. A recent RTE programme examining the progression of social issues through this period reminded us who lived through it of the bitterness of some of the clashes. I remember all too vividly and well Fr. Seán Fortune's campaign on the 1983 constitutional amendment — his doll placed on the altar with red ribbons flowing from it. That era is over. We must ensure as a legislature that it truly is over.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I pay tribute to those who came forward to speak to the Ferns Inquiry to outline the appalling abuse they suffered. I find the Ferns Report deeply disturbing and shocking, not because I am a Minister of State or a Dáil Deputy, but because I am a father of young children. The only times I have been moved to tears during my eight-year political career in this House have been when the victims of institutional abuse have told me their stories. I have been moved by the forgiveness extended by some of those who have suffered this kind of abuse to those who perpetrated such awful acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The last speaker rightly said that the abuse by certain people of their powerful positions in society is perhaps the most dangerous and sinister aspect of the contents of the Ferns Report. We need to understand that the era of monopoly power in Irish society, whether it applies in the area of morality, economics or even politics, has definitively come to an end. I hope the people of this country have learnt over the past ten, 20 or 30 years that nobody should be allowed to enjoy monopoly power over individuals or society as a whole. As Ireland matures as a country, its people, including the members of its political class, should say publicly and bravely that they will not allow such events to take place again. We will not allow people to be abused in a vicarious manner, as happened in Ferns, in institutions and, it must be said, in families.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">It is often forgotten in the maelstrom of debate and public controversy about institutional abuse that the vast majority of abuse takes place within families. I do not say that to mitigate the cause of the betrayal that occurred in Ferns. We should not forget that appalling abuse can take place between siblings, or can be perpetrated by parents against their children. Not only are all the institutions of State and those who deal with children on a daily basis responsible for ensuring that children are protected, but parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children, as well as other children in their care, are similarly protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">There is a strong need for people to speak out. We cannot allow monopoly power or monopoly voices to drown out the human rights and dignities of individuals in society who may be the subject of abuse. One of the horrible aspects of what happened in Ferns and other parts of the country, in institutions and in families was that people felt powerless and were afraid to speak out. I send a strong message that people should not be afraid to say what needs to be said. They should be given a chance to speak out. As practising politicians, we should give people such an opportunity. People should not feel inhibited, by dint of what we do in the House or as public representatives, in speaking out and having their stories heard at the highest level or at any other level of their choosing.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Ferns Report is very sobering reading. I would not recommend to anyone that they read it. A decision on whether to read it is very much a matter of personal choice. The graphic descriptions in the report cut to the core of what we are about as a society. The basis of our society is challenged by the report. Are we prepared to act in ignorance? Are we prepared to ignore? Are we prepared not to listen to the voices of people who have suffered at the hands of abusers of one kind or another? As a society, we must be careful not to become complicit in any kind of institutionalised or systemised practice of abuse ever again. We need to put in place simple reforms to give people an opportunity to speak out about matters of this kind, rather than being drowned out by those who think they possess some moral authority or control over individual lives. I do not say that lightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">It is important that we do not become over-focused on the church, which continues to have a certain amount of power in Irish society. Most of the people associated with the church have operated in an honest way and have not acted as abusers. The same can be said about the banks, which have been the subject of controversy in this House. I am sure Deputies will accept that most bank workers are honest and decent people who do not perpetrate fraud of any kind. The same can be said of those who are involved with the church. While I do not want make allowances for those who were involved in certain forms of conduct in Ferns, Dublin or elsewhere, it is important to point out that most people associated with the church are not practitioners of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">It is almost a cliché to say in debates of this nature that the character of an institution is defined by how its systems respond to complaints made by people who have chosen to speak up, to highlight certain cases or to make a plea for help. If one reads the Ferns Report, it is clear that the institutions which existed in Wexford utterly failed the victims of abuse. That is a matter of profound sadness for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">We must build a society that takes responsibility for managing people's expectations. Most people rightly expect that their voices will be heard and their concerns acted on when they speak out about matters of this nature. There is sometimes a tendency, particularly in politics, to empathise with people rather than do something practical or supportive. As a class of people who are gathered in this Parliament to represent the citizens of this country, we need to offer practical support to the people. Practical legislation that will produce practical results is needed if we are to give comfort to parents, people in authority who have jurisdiction over children and people involved in the supervision of children. People need to be reassured that matters of substance such as those in Ferns will be acted on swiftly in a clear, definitive, unbiased and objective manner. We have to make sure there is no covering or shadowing and that nobody makes allowances or fails to proceed with an investigation. We need to replace that culture with a culture of openness about everything. We need to be much more open with ourselves about matters of this nature. This issue is at the heart of how we define ourselves as a people. Are we a Christian and caring people? Are we prepared to listen to the awful things we might hear about the abuse that is taking place?</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I would like to comment on a sinister aspect of this issue that has been highlighted internationally. There is evidence to suggest that the perpetrators of child sexual abuse act in a devious and cunning manner. They are not unintelligent people who fit into some Victorian stereotype of the criminal underclass. They cross all our paths in society. Many investigations, including the FBI investigation into people paying with their credit cards to access child pornography on the Internet, have produced evidence that those involved in such crimes are people of high standing in society. Cunning and devious people with responsible positions are often prepared to collude, collaborate and connive with other people to perpetrate various forms of abuse. This is the most sinister aspect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">We need to be incredibly vigilant in this regard, for example, by arming parents with knowledge and warning them that certain people are prepared to prey on their innocent children. It is not enough for us to say there is a Government response. If this country's political class is in a position of political authority, as it claims to be — it represents the people and elects a Government with the public mandate it achieves — it must dedicate itself to the moral need to educate parents and the public about the existence of certain people and to point out to them that they need to take the first step in terms of bringing cases of abuse to the attention of the authorities. As parents, they need to become aware of the need to protect their own children because there are limits to the role of the State. Those involved in paedophile rings of one kind or another are enormously intelligent, devious and cunning in the lengths to which they go to cover up their activities and to perpetrate further crimes, by procuring and preying on young people. I do not say that lightly. As a parent of young children, I feel we have a responsibility to act quickly and definitively. There should be no showboating on this issue from the political class. It should act with strong moral integrity to tackle this issue in a meaningful way at every level, be it as a constituency Deputy, a Minister or as a citizen. This matter must be coherently addressed.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_636">I welcome the Ferns Report and the announcement of a similar inquiry into the Dublin diocese. It is vital that we understand what occurred and implement fully the recommendations of this report. A number of things struck me about the report but due to the limited time available to me I will just focus on two of them. The first thing is that the individual allegations were shockingly explicit. It was clear that the abuse was possible because those carrying out the abuse were people who had access to children by way of their position within the community. They were trusted implicitly. When allegations were made, as they were over and over again, they were not believed. Not being believed compounded the abuse that robbed those victims of the innocence of childhood. We must pay attention to those conditions if we are to learn from the bravery of those who have come forward to tell of their abuse and protect our children in the future. We must not fall into the trap of blaming all for the sins of a few because that offers no protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The second thing that was obvious to me was the power of the media. Clearly the programme broadcast in March 2002, "Suing the Pope", forced the setting up of the inquiry in the first place. The report acknowledges that. In that context I wish to refer to the refusal of the Department of Education and Science to hand over documents in the National Archives on special schools, reformatories and orphanages. These documents show the relationship between the institutions run by the church and the State. They are vital to our understanding of what took place. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, referred to openness. Documents over 30 years old generally go to the National Archives and under the National Archives Act 1986 there is a get-out clause to the effect that if documents are in regular use or if it would interfere with the running of a Department their transfer does not always take place. The documents are being used and the Department is complying with the legislation on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board. I am told the transfer of these documents to the National Archive would interfere with this inquiry. However, 1986 is a long time ago and digital equipment would allow copies of those documents to be made available in the National Archives for people who want to inspect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The last thing I wish to do is hinder the redress board in its work but it is possible to provide wider access to the documents. Many people are entering into this process, as they are invited to do in newspaper advertisements every week, and the last thing we want is for their wounds to be re-opened when on the conclusion of that work in 2008 they discover that a whole raft of additional information is put into the public arena. For that reason the documents should be put into the National Archives without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Prior to the setting up of the redress board a most restrictive approach was taken to inquiries about these documents. People were told there was a shortage of space in which to view these documents. Freedom of information requests by the media have received the same kind of reply to that which I received, that it would interfere with the running of the Department. Let us end the silence on this matter. Silence was part of the problem that caused this abuse in the past. The openness to which the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, referred is something to which the State must pay attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I agree with what Deputy O'Donnell said about the inappropriate relationship that existed between the church and State. The several churches and the State should exist as separate entities. The Ferns Report has brought admissions by clerics of an inadequate understanding of human sexuality yet there was no shortage of guidance from that same body throughout the history of the State. That guidance is now seen as inappropriate. It is a pity so many lives have been destroyed before we could get these kind of admissions. I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that this issue should be acted upon.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_349">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_641">The Ferns Report is one of a series of inquiries into child sexual abuse which demonstrate the failures of those with responsibility to protect children from harm. I am truly humbled by the strength and courage of all survivors of child abuse, those named by this inquiry and all those who remain anonymous.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">A certainty stemming from this emotive inquiry, as it did from the previous inquiries in the 1990s for example, into the swimming association, is that lessons must be learned and commitments made, if children are to be protected now and in the future. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Ireland in 1992, enshrines the rights of children to protection from violence, abuse and exploitation. States are obliged to implement its contents. In 1999 the Department of Health and Children published, Children First: national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. The guidelines were republished last year and they constitute an overview of the State's working procedures for the protection of children from abuse. Children First represents a good model for the protection of children by the State but only if it is fully resourced and implemented. Due to under-resourcing and staffing shortages, it is not being implemented in all Health Service Executive areas at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Implementation failures have been identified by a number of child protection officers, CPOs. The introduction of the post of CPO in the youth work sector resulted from the recommendations of Children First, which included a role description. It is the responsibility of these CPOs to ensure child protection concerns in their organisations are reported to the relevant authorities, so they are uniquely placed to identify deficiencies in the implementation of the guidelines by the key State bodies. The issues identified by CPOs and relayed to Sinn Féin include: inability to make contact with the designated persons in the Health Service Executive and the frequent failure of the designated persons to return calls; misinformation from social work department staff; lack of follow-through despite explicit provisions for same; great pressure and onus being placed on CPOs by social workers and the need for consistent boundaries between the two to be observed; a lack of consistency in terms of responses between individual social workers and across HSE areas, and difficulties assisting children and their families to access practical supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">These issues are resulting in a failure to protect children which constitutes ongoing neglect of children by the State. On behalf of Sinn Féin I stress that this inexcusable failure on the part of the Government to implement its own guidelines is not the fault of social workers, rather it is due to the decision at Government level to under-resource and overstretch these hard working and caring individuals beyond their limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">On foot of the Ferns Report, past inquiries and media revelations as to the prevalence of child abuse, Sinn Féin demands that the Government makes a commitment to fully resource and implement Children First.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_646">It is time to look again at the relationship between the church and State. The Preamble to the Constitution states: "In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred, We, the people of Éire, Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ..."</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Article 44 states: "It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion". This has to change. In particular, that reference in Article 44 must change to move with the times. I do not say that those of us who profess religion should not show respect to a deity but we are sending out the wrong message to the Muslim, the Hindu, the Sikh, the agnostic and to those who do not believe in a God. Painful though it may be, we must separate the church from the State. It is an important issue and it must be tackled. The special place of the Catholic Church and the reference to Jesus Christ in the Preamble to our Constitution must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">We must also change the right of church representatives to chair school boards of management. We must provide more funding to multidenominational schools. Educate Together makes a strong plea for increased funding and we must honour that plea. We must provide a strong vetting system for those working with children. The gardaí simply do not have the resources needed to deal with this issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_656">I regret the need for such a report but having read it, it is clear there is such a need. I support the suggestion made by Deputy Enright some time ago that perhaps the appropriate forum in which to debate the report and to go through the recommendations is a committee of the Joint Committees on Health and Children and Education and Science. As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I would welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I do not want to throw out the old cliche which has been thrown out but it is worth mentioning that many people, who gave their lives voluntarily over the years to work within the clergy and who have acted properly, unfortunately feel condemned. It is our duty to follow the recommendations in the report but it is important to recognise at every opportunity the huge input of clergy over the years. I was in a boarding school run by clergy for five years and saw at first-hand the commitment of the Patrician Brothers in Ballyfin and throughout the State. While it might be taking away from the time allocated to me to speak on the report, it is, nevertheless, important to say that.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The report highlights the need for us to change drastically, and I refer specifically to school management, management boards and the input of clergy to those boards. I believe the debate will now widen. Times of yore have long passed and the issues raised by this report must be addressed immediately not only to restore confidence in the system for those who have been abused but for wider public as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I pay tribute to Bishop Walsh on the way he handled this report and the fact he went to Ferns not armed with anything extra but was able to come to terms and to deal with the issues and to be seen as an open and transparent representative of the church. I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the way he presented the report. He has acted properly at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The issue of Canon Law versus State law has come to the fore. There has been much confusion and doubt about the importance of Canon Law. It is now recognised that State law comes first and that Canon Law can never impede it or act as a cover for those who claim such cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">As we progress through the issues, it is important we focus on the role of the State and the church in education. We must recognise the great hurt caused to those who suffered, to those who tried to make it public and to those who tried to change the system so such hurt would not continue and people would be brought to buck but who were, unfortunately, dismissed over the years. I pay tribute to the courage, strength and integrity of each person who suffered the worst forms of abuse and who subsequently came forward and gave evidence to the Ferns Inquiry. Even though the hurt has been proven it has, nevertheless, taken years for the authorities and for us to believe such hurt could be caused. Unfortunately, the torture inflicted on these people may not ease with time and will continue to haunt them. As a parent, one can only begin to imagine the pain visited on the victims of abuse and the families who suffered as a result by those who were unfortunately, in many cases, put on a pedestal by society.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Reading the report is, to say the least, startling. Each of the 260 odd pages of the report is more horrific than the preceding one. Over a 40-year period, 21 priests operating in the diocese of Ferns faced over 100 allegations of child sex abuse. I have learned from the first-hand experience of Members from the Wexford constituency. Only a few minutes ago, Deputy Howlin referred to the involvement of Fr. Seán Fortune in the 1983 referendum. That focuses our attention on how people put on a pedestal or in authority can abuse it and cause considerable hurt. It is only now we have come to realise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The church's response to allegations of clerical sexual abuse was wholly inadequate. The guardians of morality in our society failed to live up to the high standards they often put forward for the rest of society. Children are surely the most vulnerable in society and rather than shield them from the possibility of abuse, the church, in many instances, merely shifted the problem to some other parish. This was certainly a case of hear no evil, see no evil. Where serious allegations of abuse were made, the hierarchy chose to bury their heads in the sand in the hope the problem would simply go away. The Ferns Report showed that when problems arose, they did not go away. Simply transferring a priest did not resolve the problem. If the Ferns Report is a forerunner of reports to come, we must act immediately. In that regard, I congratulate the Government on accepting all the recommendations in the Ferns Report. Confirmation has now been sought from the Bishops' Conference that the recommendations in the report will be implemented collectively and individually, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">What has shocked most members of the public is the distance the hierarchy managed to put between itself and its congregations. Protection has been the name of the game and that must be resolved. It was a case of admitting to nothing and praying the issue would blow over. In times of grief and distress, we all want to call on a priest but in the case of clerical abuse, the hierarchy chose to ignore these calls. Unfortunately, whether unable or unwilling, the evidence suggests that successive Bishops of Ferns fumbled when dealing with this most sensitive issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">We must move on to being judged by those who have been abused. We must show our commitment as legislators that we are taking the recommendations seriously. It is important not only to say we are taking them seriously but to act on those recommendations immediately and put in place procedures. We must create a culture of belief when people are courageous enough to come forward rather than dismiss it as an attack on some other authority. We must gain public confidence that this State has learned from what has emerged from the Ferns Report and is making a steadfast commitment to ensure issues raised in the report are dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The power of the church must be examined because for decades the church failed to act. It is guilty of letting its congregation down. The church failed the overwhelming majority of nuns and priests who gave their lives to their vocation and their communities. Priests who have given their lives in service of their parishes have been jeered and called paedophiles, child abusers and so on. However, in the rush to condemn, difficulties have been visited on hundreds of priests who have been accused of similar behaviour. Most of those who take up a vocation forego lucrative incomes in the private sector. Many of them attend third level for the same number of years as students who qualify in the fields of law and medicine. We should recognise they chose the religious life and the vast majority of them are not guilty of child abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Society as a whole, however, also shares the blame for the years of silence regarding child abuse. It is not good enough to say the State agencies were powerless to act such was the power of the church. Garda notes are missing in a number of cases and, for example, the Southern Health Board failed to act when notified of abuse. All citizens are equal in the eyes of the law and for too long one's position in society earned one a right to protection from the law. This should never be allowed to happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Francis Murphy and the other members of the inquiry team. They gave more than their professional time to the inquiry. Following much turmoil and personal angst, they have delivered a comprehensive and devastating report into clerical sex abuse in the diocese of Ferns. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Brian Lenihan, deserve great credit for the way they have handled this matter. The Minister and the Cabinet displayed great courage by establishing this inquiry more than two and a half years ago. The Minister of State has exercised a safe pair of hands in dealing with matters in recent months and he has been open and proper in all his dealings.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I also pay tribute to Bishop Walsh who has ensured, since taking over as apostolic administrator in 2002, that steps have been taken to protect children effectively. It is regrettable that there was a necessity for such an inquiry and report but clearly the need was there and it is up to us to prove our commitment to those who were abused by acting immediately on all the recommendations.</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this sad and tragic report. Terrible hurt and pain was inflicted on many people at a vulnerable age. I am a practising Catholic and, like most of us, I am probably an <i>á la carte</i> Catholic. However, my faith and my church is important and, while I cannot compare anything with the hurt of the children who were abused, those of us to whom faith is important have also been deeply hurt by this exposé. Those who perpetrated and covered up the abuse should understand the hurt of people whose church is important to them. I have never felt the Catholic Church is the be all and end all of everything. Other churches have a similar role. I did not have a choice, but if I had, I would probably have become a Methodist because I have enormous regard for Methodists in my area. There is also a large Church of Ireland congregation in my area and one of the most moving events I ever attended at home was a 9/11 memorial service involving the Methodist, Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic congregations in the local Roman Catholic Church led by the Methodist minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Those who perpetrated and covered up the terrible acts against children represented Christ on earth. I would like to remind them of what Christ said about children and how they should be dealt with. I refer to St. Matthew's gospel, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_672">At the time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" He called a child whom he put among them and said: "Truly, I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes you. If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the sea.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_673">"Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks. Occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom stumbling blocks come. If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire.  And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire. Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of my Father in heaven.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_674">What do you think?"</p>
          <p eId="para_675">If the people who perpetrated these crimes read the words of their own master, they would see how wrong they were and if those who covered up their crimes read them, how could they ever justify covering up such deeds?</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I refer to the effect of sexual abuse on children. When child abuse occurs, a victim can develop a variety of distressing feelings, thoughts and behaviours. No child is psychologically prepared to cope with repeated sexual stimulation. Even a two year old who cannot know sexual activity is wrong will develop problems resulting from the inability to cope with over-stimulation. A child of five or older who knows and cares for the abuser becomes trapped between affection or loyalty for the person and the sense that sexual activities are terribly wrong. If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence and loss of love. A child who is the victim of prolonged sexual abuse usually develops low self-esteem, a feeling of worthlessness and an abnormal or distorted view of sex. The child may become withdrawn and mistrustful of adults and can become suicidal.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Children who have been sexually abused have difficulty relating to others, except on sexual terms, and some become child abusers or prostitutes, or experience other serious problems when they reach adulthood. Often there are no obvious physical signs of child sexual abuse. A number of signs can be detected through physical examination by a doctor. Sexually abused children may develop an unusual interest in or avoidance of all things of a sexual nature. They experience sleep problems and they often have nightmares. They suffer depression and can withdraw from friends or family. They may make statements that their bodies are dirty or damaged or fear there is something wrong with them in the genital area. They may refuse to go to school or they may become delinquent and have behavioural problems. They often become secretive and they sometimes display aspects of their sexual molestation in their drawings, games and fantasies. They may be unusually aggressive and may present with suicidal behaviour and ideation. Child sexual abusers can make the child extremely fearful of telling someone and the child can only talk freely when a special effort has helped the child feel safe. If a child says he or she has been molested a parent should try to remain calm and reassure the child that what happened was not the child's fault. Parents should seek a medical examination and a psychiatric consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The initial and short-term effects of abuse usually occur within two years of the termination of the abuse. These effects vary, depending on the circumstances of the abuse and the child's stage of development. The effects may include regressive behaviour such as a return to thumb sucking and bed wetting, sleep disturbance, eating problems, behaviour and-or performance problems in school, and non-participation in school and social activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The negative effects of child abuse can affect the victim for many years and into adulthood. Adults sexually abused as children commonly experience depression and high levels of anxiety in these adults can result in self-destructive behaviour such as alcoholism and drug abuse, anxiety attacks, situation specific anxiety disorders and insomnia. Many victims encounter problems in their adult relationships and adult sexual functioning. Re-victimisation is a common phenomenon in people abused as children. Research has shown that child sexual abuse victims are more likely to be victims of rape or be involved in physically abusive relationships as adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The ill effects of child abuse are wide-ranging and there is no one set of symptoms or outcomes. Some children report little or no psychological distress from the abuse but these children may be afraid to express their emotions or may be denying feelings as a coping mechanism. Other children may have sleeper effects, experiencing no harm in the short term but suffering serious problems in later life.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Can a child recover from sexual abuse? In an attempt to better understand the ill-effects of child abuse, psychologists have studied the factors that may lessen the impact of abuse. Factors that affect the amount of harm done to the victim include the age of the child, the duration, frequency and intrusiveness of the abuse, the degree of force used and the relationship with the abuser. Children's interpretation of the abuse, whether they disclose the abuse and how quickly they report it also affects the short and long-term consequences. It is very easy to abhor child sexual abuse but it is important to understand the effects and the destructive outcome for children.</p>

          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_682">I wish to share time with Deputy Hoctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. The catalogue of depravity revealed in the Ferns Report makes for sorry reading. We owe a debt of gratitude to the authors of the report, particularly Mr. Justice Murphy, for producing a clear and concise report in the timescale allocated. In the limited time available I do not propose to examine in detail the scale of child sex abuse by priests attached to the diocese of Ferns. The scale and awfulness of the abuse is well documented in the report. I reiterate the suggestion of the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, that this committee along with the Committee on Education and Science would be a suitable vehicle to examine the contents of the report in more depth.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Chapter 4, where repeated allegations and complaints are detailed, makes for harrowing reading. Child sex abuse is a terrifying ordeal for the unfortunate child involved. Everyone is particularly revolted when a person of authority in the eyes of the child, such as a parent, teacher, doctor or priest, is involved. That does not imply abuse is any less serious if carried out by an adult not in a position of authority. The catalogue of abuse detailed in pages 70 to 123 is horrific and the psychological scarring for the victims is immense. Their courage in the face of extreme adversity is to be commended and it is imperative lessons are learned and the correct procedures put in place to ensure such a litany of disasters does not occur again.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">What can legislators do? The value of this report is that it brings to light a matter that has been hidden from public scrutiny for a long time. Paedophilia is present in our society and we must recognise this or our children will continue to suffer. Paedophilia has been present since time immemorial. At times, recognition of its intrinsic evil has been highlighted and steps taken to counteract it. With increasing research, some degree of understanding has developed. We do not know what turns certain individuals into paedophiles but we know treatment is long and difficult and not always successful. We also know prevention is infinitely better than cure, an aspect to which I wish to refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">A paedophile cannot commit paedophilia without access to children. Emphasis must be placed on protecting children as much as possible. Scrutiny of all adults with access to children must be of the highest standard. A strong case exists for the presence of two adults at all times while children are involved in an activity. Such a policy will be difficult to implement, particularly in the sporting and voluntary sector where it is increasingly difficult to recruit coaches and volunteers. The presence of another adult lessens the danger that a child may be abused as well as acting as protection for the adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Mandatory reporting is an issue about which there is some conflict but I am persuaded it should be put in place, with clear guidelines, so that complaints or suspicions put forward for the wrong reasons are dealt with. I urge the Minister of State to examine how this important component of dealing with child sex abuse may be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I welcome the decision to set up an investigation into child abuse in the diocese of Dublin. Questions have been asked of the other dioceses in Ireland. I understand the Minister of State has the authority to examine any other diocese if he feels it is warranted and I would be grateful if he could confirm this.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Constituents have brought to my attention the role played by members of religious orders who engaged in child sex abuse while on secondment to a diocese for parochial duties. Are the activities of these priests under the jurisdiction of the bishop or the religious superior? I note that members of religious congregations were not covered in the Ferns Report. Are procedures in place so that child sex abuse by members of religious congregations can be exposed in the same manner this report exposed the paedophilia of certain priests in the Ferns diocese? The Ferns Report is an important step in the right direction and it is up to us to play our part in the protection of children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Ms Hoctor</from>
          <p eId="para_690">Having read the Ferns Report, I also share the horror and deep sadness that others have expressed. I must declare that I knew two of the priests who are named in the report. It is difficult to understand the behaviour outlined in the report of those who perpetrated those crimes, in addition to those who permitted the silence that followed and enabled that behaviour to recommence elsewhere. It is quite incomprehensible and cannot be condoned. One can but try to grasp why this happened and understand how it occurred in the way it did. We must learn from the revelations that were given so courageously by those who suffered and who carried that pain within them for so many years before having the opportunity to tell their stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Having listened to many of my colleagues, we must try to be as clear headed as possible in trying to understand the terrible sadness involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">We are still learning about the phenomenon of paedophilia. Deputy Devins said it has been in existence since time began. No doubt it has been, but it is only now that we are able to put a name on it. Many years ago, it would have been seen as a dirty habit or strange behaviour and, to some extent, that may explain why it was not dealt with properly at the time. Nevertheless, that attitude does not condone the silence that shrouded this criminal behaviour and enabled it to continue. Young people were hurt and had to carry the pain into adulthood. As elected representatives, we must now enable them to deal with that situation and move on in life, although they can never leave it behind since it has left such an indelible mark.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Members of the Oireachtas are in a responsible position to address this matter in the best way possible. Expert psychologists claim that people with paedophilic tendencies gravitated towards the respectable role of the priesthood where they had access to children. Unfortunately, the vocation of the priesthood, for which I have deep respect, was greatly abused in that way. It should be made clear that paedophiles became priests and not <i>vice versa</i>. It is also important to make clear that homosexuality is not co-related to paedophilia. There is a danger that some reporting may suggest that is the case, although we know it is not so.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The past few weeks have been devastating for those of us learning about this matter for the first time through the report. I welcome the accumulation of data in the report as well as the work that is being undertaken to put together stringent strategies in all dioceses throughout the country. The Children First programme has been implemented in many voluntary organisations, but not all. Everyone involved in volunteerism with access to children must engage in the programme. This is as much for the children's protection as for that of the volunteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Given my political interests, I welcome the fact the Garda central vetting unit will be located in Thurles. Quite apart from the proposed location with which I am delighted, the work of the unit is vital. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for his work in this area, which I have discussed with him privately. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has also been involved in this work. I urge those involved to continue the work on drafting mandatory reporting legislation without delay. A similar effort is required with regard to legislation governing the logging and vetting of people who will work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Before the criminal records bureau was established in the United Kingdom, agencies had all worked in isolation from one another. When the work of the Garda central vetting unit begins in Thurles, I urge the Minister to set up a multi-agency, public protection panel. The HSE, local authority housing sections, the Garda Síochána, the probation service and social services should work in partnership to provide a full picture of such offenders. By providing information on an inter-agency basis, such people can be fully monitored.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_697">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I support the proposal that the Committee on Health and Children and the Committee on Education and Science should have the opportunity to study this extremely good report jointly. They should examine its recommendations in detail. The report not only relates what occurred but also provides a useful examination of the structural aspects of the bodies concerned. In the circumstances, the aforementioned committees are the appropriate fora to undertake a study of the report. I hope that specific recommendations will be made that can be agreed upon and implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Earlier today, Deputy O'Donnell spoke in the slot ordered for the spokesperson of the Progressive Democrats Party. I must assume, therefore, that since that was by an order of the House, she was speaking on behalf of her party in everything she said. If so, I expect that her party will be making proposals to Government concerning the issues she raised. I wonder if Deputy O'Donnell was speaking on behalf of Deputies Sexton, Tim O'Malley, Grealish and Parlon because she was occupying the official slot of the Progressive Democrats Party. None of us should throw out statements in the House on this issue without giving thought and consideration to them within our party structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">One of the points raised by Deputy O'Donnell concerned the indemnity deal with the religious institutions. I wonder if there will now be a proposal for a fairer balance both in terms of financial and legal responsibility with regard to cases — not just in the redress board, but also legal cases that may arise, which were also covered under that indemnity deal. Members of the House have a responsibility not only for what they say but also for what they do as a result of their remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">In an earlier contribution, my colleague, Deputy McManus, referred to gaps that exist in this context. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse deals with institutional abuse, and in addition we have the Ferns Report, the Dublin report and the audit for other dioceses. However, there is no way of investigating religious who were not priests of a diocese but who may have abused their positions of responsibility in schools. This morning, I listened to Mr. Timothy O'Rourke who has long campaigned on behalf of day-pupils in schools. There is a broader issue to be addressed, therefore, and gaps remain. We must learn the lessons of this report and other investigations that have taken place or will occur in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The message from this report and the experience of child abuse generally is that there was a terrible imbalance of power in our country in the past and, to some extent, there may still be. Young children were powerless and people in institutions, in this case the Catholic Church, had enormous power and wielded it to abuse children.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I acknowledge that there were very many priests who did not abuse that power, but the structures allowed some priests to do so. We owe it to everybody to ensure a rebalance of power takes place. The State as a democratic entity must play its role in the education system. In the past it did not play an appropriate role but allowed the Catholic Church use its power, and in the cases instanced here, abuse that power.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The report states that in some cases abusing priests availed of their roles in the school system. On page 187 it refers to Canon Clancy who it appears used his position as manager of the local national school to access children as young as nine years of age. On page 164 it states that Father Fortune as curate of Ballymurn was appointed chairman of the board of management of Ballymurn national school. He also gave religious instruction in Bridgetown VEC. These are just two examples in which the priest's role as manager of a school was used to abuse children.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I recently heard a principal of a school in the Ferns diocese on the radio saying he had to make up excuses not to send children to the priest's house because he suspected the priest was abusing children. He did not have the power to face the priest and refuse to send the children to his house. We must address those power structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The first way to do so is to give children power by ensuring that the Stay Safe programme runs in all schools. I raised this issue yesterday with the Minister for Education and Science. I do not accept that her Department will not exert its authority to ensure that every child has the protection of the abilities and skills the programme provides for children, parents, teachers and the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">While I acknowledge that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has worked hard on the vetting procedure, this applies only to those in a few categories in the education system. That needs to be introduced immediately. I agree with Deputy Enright that it should be introduced for volunteers who have power in schools, whether on boards of management or other situations or organisations which have access to young children.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">We also need stronger anti-bullying programmes in schools because these matters are related. There is an element of bullying in abuse and if children learn how to stand up to bullies they will have more power to stand up to abuse. We need to examine specific areas with regard to legislation because for example, the churches are largely excluded from the equality legislation. Aspects of the Education Act deal with the ethos of schools. Parents can choose to send their children to schools with a certain ethos, or schools should be allowed to maintain that ethos but parents who choose to send their children to multi-denominational schools also have rights and choices and I echo calls for support for Educate Together.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Within that framework, however, the Department of Education and Science has further responsibilities. Although an ethos should be maintained, the Department cannot give total governance of schools to religious or other bodies. We must examine the structure of boards of management and how we appoint and train teachers, particularly in the primary sector which is denominational.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The bishops choose the chairperson and formally appoint the other members of the boards of management and set up the panels to interview teachers. The State as a democratic entity needs to ensure that it balances the power of the hierarchical structures of the Catholic Church, which do business in a different way. Pages 25 and 26 of the report deal with those structures and the power of individual bishops, some of whom make good choices and decisions, particularly the present Bishop of Ferns and the Archbishop of Dublin. It is not mandatory, however, for bishops to adopt the framework they have agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The strong individual powers within a hierarchical structure are very different from those within a democratic structure. We as legislators, and the Government, must ensure that the democratic structures have a better balance of power within the running of schools than they have now. The joint committees that will deal with the issues raised in this report must consider this in depth.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">These matters are also raised on pages 37 and 38 in respect of Canon Law and the constitutional rights of churches. We need to examine the constitutional rights under Article 44.2.5° of churches to order their own affairs. How does this cross over with their role in schools? Are schools parts of church institutions or are they State institutions? Where do these constitutional rights intersect? The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has some knowledge of these matters but it is not clear. We need to know that the State has ultimate control over what happens in schools but we have not reached that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">There is much more to be said. We need clear structures, protocols and arrangements for conveying information, including "soft information", about people who might abuse children. We need to ensure that information is passed from one place to another where relevant, so that schools and churches are not islands unto themselves, and our democratic responsibility to all the children of the nation is properly followed through. We need to tease out further the important lessons in this document and implement the necessary changes.</p>

        <speech by="#JimGlennonFF" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Mr. Glennon</from>
          <p eId="para_713">I wish to share time with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">While I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to such an important debate, like my colleagues I regret the situation that has given rise to this debate. Like Deputy Neville, I am a member of the Roman Catholic Church and describe myself as an <i>á la carte</i> Catholic. I also had an uncle, now deceased, who as a member of the clergy had a role in the Canon Law procedures concerning clerical abuse in the Dublin diocese.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The term "abuse" is facile and inappropriate in this context. We speak of the abuse of power, position, influence, and of children. It is not right to place the subject in respect of children in the same category as the other forms of abuse. The bodies, minds and integrity of these children were violated. We should refer to the perpetrators of that act not as abusers but as violators, a stronger, better word with a unique meaning eminently appropriate in these unfortunate circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">There has been much criticism of church and State in recent weeks, much of it justified. The twin pillars of Irish society for so many years are on shifting sands. Both have been very slow to react and have earned themselves no credit. The State has been guilty of not listening. If it listened, it certainly paid no heed. Yet again we have the Irish phenomenon of missing files. What is it with us and missing files? We have them in the planning inquiries, in cases of Garda corruption and now in paedophilia. To me, missing files represent a complete exploitation of the presumption of innocence, one of the cornerstones of our democracy. As legislators we must bite the bullet and increase the onus on those charged with the custody of files, to ensure the information continued in them is available. There should be no lack of opportunity now to maintain an alternative or back-up file but I hope this is the last instance we have of worthwhile and vital investigations such as this being impeded and inhibited because of the excuse of missing files. I do not accept it for a minute, nor does anyone. "Missing" is not an appropriate word. Other words are much more appropriate and should be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Deputy O'Sullivan referred to Deputy O'Donnell's contribution. Deputy O'Donnell spoke of the necessity for ending the special relationship between church and State. I agree with her. That relationship has been evolving over the past number of years for the benefit of church and State. It was an unhealthy relationship for both institutions. The days of Canon Law having primacy over civil and State law are gone, and the sooner that becomes hard reality, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Catholic Church has been let down, first by a small proportion of its clergy, and also by Rome, which had the potential to deliver an objectivity to the decision-making process of the diocese, untouched by the human relations which obviously arise and which plagued this particular controversy. Rome let the diocese down. The diocese was also let down by its own structures. We know, as does everyone in this country, that the vast majority of priests are pillars of our society and essential elements of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I am conscious the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has some relevant remarks to make. I conclude by congratulating Bishop Eamonn Walsh, who has dealt with this issue in an exemplary manner. I also wish our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, all the best in the important and difficult task he has before him. I have no doubt he will pursue his task with the utter integrity needed. If the integrity of this investigation falls short of 100%, a particular disservice will be done to the State in general and in particular to the victims of this unfortunate set of circumstances, of whom there are all too many.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I thank Deputy Glennon for sharing time. We are all shocked and dismayed at the extent of the allegations of abuse detailed in the Ferns Report. It makes sorry reading for all of us and especially for people like myself, born and raised in County Wexford. While rumour and innuendo were about for a number of years, people in Wexford remain shell-shocked at the catalogue of abuse which the Ferns Report contains. We share the concern and heartache of many people as a result of the harrowing experience suffered by the victims, in some cases for years. They have shown great courage in coming forward to tell their stories to the Murphy inquiry. That was clearly not easy for them or their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">As Deputy Glennon and others said in this House, there are some excellent priests, and those of us who are practising Catholics recognise some of the great work being carried out by priests in County Wexford and across the country. However, what happened in Wexford probably happened throughout the country. One would expect that the Dublin report and other reports throughout the country will be carried out as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">With the Catholic Church perceived throughout the world as a great institution, it is quite amazing that there seem to be no guidelines or rules in existence, or available to bishops, on how to deal with allegations against priests of child sex abuse. Reading the Ferns Report, it seems the bishops tried to deal with abuse allegations in their own ways, switching priests around, turning a blind eye and hiding behind Canon Law, but never taking decisive action to deal with the allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Some people have expressed serious concern about priests being chairmen of school boards of management. Having talked to many priests throughout my county, I know that many of them would like to be relieved of those duties. The time has probably come for this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I too pay tribute to Bishop Eamonn Walsh. He has taken very decisive action with regard to Ferns and quite properly has dealt appropriately with all the allegations against priests from the time he was appointed administrator of the Ferns diocese and for all the time he has been there. It is generally recognised that no cover-up was involved and that every action possible was taken by Bishop Eamonn Walsh. He is to be complimented on that. I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for taking decisive action in dealing with the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Ferns Report has been referred to the DPP. People in my county, and all of us, would like to see prosecutions of the perpetrators of such acts of violence against young people. I know the DPP is independent, but going by the evidence to be put before him, there is a hope in Wexford that decisive action will be taken and that we will see prosecutions of the persons involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis labhairt ar an tuairisc seo. Crith talún atá i gceist maidir le héigniú agus brúidiúlacht a rinneadh ar pháistí i gceantar Ferns, Loch Garman.

Ní fiú na ceachtanna a fhoghlaim muna bhfuil muid sásta beart a dhéanamh dá réir.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the courage and strength of the many victims of child abuse on this island and, in particular, to those who helped Mr. Justice Murphy ensure that the truth emerged in the Ferns Report. I hope that other victims will have the same courage when they receive opportunities, whether in Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland, to expose the systematic abuse of young children perpetrated over a number of decades within the church and other institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Both the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Child Care Act 1991 enshrine the principle that the welfare of the child must be the paramount consideration in all decisions and interventions. If the Government is to deliver on this moral duty and legal obligation, a number of issues must be addressed. My colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, identified a number of measures and Deputy Crowe made the case for providing resources for Children First. Funding should also be made available directly to the youth work sector to enable it to deliver appropriate child protection training specific to the needs identified by that sector. This might be rolled out under the aegis of the child protection unit of the National Youth Council of Ireland and would encourage sectors which work directly with children to take on extra responsibilities. However, if they do so, we will have to fund them.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The upholding by the State of its special responsibility to protect children must be underpinned by prevention and response. As Sinn Féin spokesperson for justice, equality and human rights, I will elaborate further on recommendations made by Deputy Ó Caoláin on Garda vetting and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">For every employee working with children in this State, there are at least 20 volunteers. In September 2004, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced that the Garda Síochána's vetting services would be extended to cover volunteers who work with children, a declaration which was widely welcomed. More than one year later, there is still no sign of this being delivered. Yesterday, in the wake of the Ferns Report, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, indicated that volunteers will not be vetted in order, she claimed, to protect volunteerism. This notion is at stark odds with the reality that the main source of demand for the vetting of volunteers is the voluntary sector itself. The Government's ongoing failure to deliver this essential element in the prevention of child abuse is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The Garda Síochána is the only agency in the State with statutory responsibility for the investigation of child abuse. As such, it is imperative that every garda receives comprehensive child protection training to a level adequate to equip him or her to address child protection issues. Only a select few gardaí have received such training. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure this training is made compulsory for all new and existing gardaí. It should be developed, resourced and rolled out as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">It is scandalous that we must address a report such as this, that these events occurred in the first instance and that the complete facts of the matter took so long to come before this House. Those involved in the Murphy inquiry did tremendous work in bringing forward these findings and should not be slighted. However, these events were covered up for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Other Deputies referred to files that went missing. Every inquiry this House initiates seems to involve missing files. That in itself is a scandal and I expect that charges will be laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions against those who were involved in cover-ups, interfering with the work of the inquiry or the destruction of files. Every Member of this House would welcome charges which send the message that the State will do its utmost to ensure events such as these will never be repeated and that anybody who contributes to cover-ups involving the abuse of children will face the full rigours of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">A number of the priests who abused children in Ferns also committed similar deeds in other dioceses. Further reports on these matters will reveal the full extent of this horrific scandal, the consequences of which this society will have to address. Members of this House must give their full backing to measures that will ensure such a scandal will never happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The definition of physical abuse, as outlined by Children First, includes injuries resulting from neglectful failure to protect a child. The Government, Garda and those who hold positions of power and respect have the duty to protect children with whom they come in contact or who may be put in danger. I put it to the Government that the demands made by Sinn Féin and others must be met if the next generation of children is to be protected from abuse. Abuse should not be inflicted on a child by the Catholic Church, State institutions, schools, sporting organisations or in any situation where children are in the care of adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">We must put in place the best possible protections and preventative measures and, should abuse occur, we should not wait decades but respond as quickly as possible. This is not a party political issue but a societal one. Child abusers should be dealt with effectively. I hope the DPP will bring charges against those who violated the trust of children and society.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMulcahyFF" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_737">I read the Ferns Report on two occasions and join others in praising the courage of those victims of child sexual abuse who have come forward voluntarily to give evidence. These acts of courage were borne out by the judgment of Mr. Justice Murphy. The process was obviously distressing and hurtful and impacted on the private lives of the victims and their families, but their decisions to come forward with evidence have been helpful. A learning process for this society must be at the core of this report. I disagree somewhat with the previous speaker in that this matter is not about prosecuting people <i>per se </i>but is about examining a sorry chapter in the history of the diocese of Ferns and the terrible wrongs perpetrated on a large number of young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I also pay tribute to the team who delivered this report, in particular retired judge, Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, formerly of the Supreme Court, Dr. Helen Buckley and Dr. Laraine Joyce. I have read numerous reports over the years but this one is a model of clarity and succinctness. I particularly like the fact that, in one chapter, all of the allegations of abuse are set out, item by item and then, in a later chapter, again on an itemised basis, one can see and easily follow the nature and extent, if any, of the State agency response to that abuse. It is easy to follow and comprehensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">We should remember that this was not a typical judicial inquiry, in that it was entirely voluntary in nature. In that context, I wish to refer to a section from Chapter 8, Conclusions and Recommendations, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_740">The persons against whom the allegations were made were not given an opportunity to confront or cross-examine the complainants in the course of this Inquiry. The Terms of Reference of the Inquiry require it to identify the allegations of child sexual abuse as reported and to consider the response to those allegations by the appropriate authorities. Such response could not be predicated on proving the truth or otherwise of such allegations. The Inquiry does not express, and was not required to express any view as to the truth or otherwise of any allegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Therefore, judicially, all of these allegations are actually unproven. They may have been given under oath and so on but they are not proven in the sense that evidence was properly taken either in a court of law or before a judicial inquiry. That is as it should have been because the key point is for the State to look at itself and see whether the response of its agencies — the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and, in particular, the Garda Síochána — was adequate. All Members of the House who read the report can see that the response varied from case to case.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I wish to focus on the response of the Garda authorities. They are criticised quite strongly, particularly in terms of keeping inadequate records. There also seems to have been a reluctance to investigate in certain cases, particularly those dating from before 1960. In fairness, however, if one reads the chapter where all the responses of the Garda authorities are detailed, the inquiry finds that most of the responses were quite good or quite adequate. In fact, the word "adequate" is used a great deal. Therefore, other than the unacceptable failure to keep records and the pre-1960 reluctance to investigate, it seems that Garda investigations were fairly adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Unfortunately, not enough people were prosecuted for abuse at the time. Formal complaints were made in respect of ten priests and seven investigations were conducted. No prosecution arose in one case, the remaining six were prosecuted, with only three criminal convictions secured. As part of the lessons for the State, we must acknowledge that the number of convictions was very small.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I welcome the setting up of the commission of investigation, under Ms Justice Yvonne Hardiman, into the Dublin diocese in the period 1975 to 2004. I read the comprehensive speech delivered by the Minister of State, Mr. Brian Lenihan, and accept his statement that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_745">It is proposed that the commission may investigate the situation in any Catholic diocese in the State following a notification from my office that the diocese may not be implementing church guidelines on child sexual abuse by a priest or religious or a notification that a diocese may not be implementing satisfactorily the recommendations of the Ferns Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">I was not totally happy with that paragraph, however, because it appears to be putting the onus back on the church authorities to police themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">More importantly, perhaps, I wish to repeat a question posed in <i>The Irish Times </i>today. Why is there only an investigation into the Dublin diocese? I do not know the answer to that question. It is possible that clerical child abuse may have been a widespread practice in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Therefore, is there not a case for a more general investigation? This is not a question, as the Minister of State also argued, of a grand inquisition into the Catholic Church. Rather, we need to look at ourselves, as a regulatory body and as a State, to see how we responded to allegations of child sexual abuse in every diocese. I understand that the new commission of investigation will only examine the period between 1975 and 2004. I hope the Minister can indicate why earlier periods are excluded. Why are the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s not included in the investigation?</p>
          <p eId="para_748">In general terms, I agree with what the Minister of State said. I too am appalled, shocked and dismayed by what I read. The report is a document of the utmost seriousness. By and large, the State and the monitoring agencies did not put adequate or timely monitoring procedures in place to stop the abuse. I do not believe we can ever completely stop it. However, all organisations, within their own cultures, must want to prevent a situation where this kind of thing can happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">It is sad that it was the State, and not the church, that brought forward this document. The church has learned and has moved on. However, it is healthy for us to have this debate and I hope we will learn more and improve the situation for the benefit of the children of this country in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_750">I commend Mr. Justice Frank Murphy and the team who carried out the inquiry and compiled the report. On reading the report, it is obvious that much hard work, sweat, discussion, interviewing and reporting went into it and it is a very fine piece of work. I also commend the victims who came forward and had the courage to tell their stories because the stories they told are harrowing and saddening, both for them and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">It saddens me to speak on this subject. I come from the diocese of Ferns and I know, or know of, many of the victims. I also know some of those who carried out the abuse and this is very upsetting for their families too.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The Ferns Report outlines exactly what happened. The truth is in this report. As we have seen, there was a culture of secrecy that protected the abusers in the diocese of Ferns for many years. I have no doubt that secrecy about many other abusers exists in many other dioceses, not just within the church but also outside it. No child should feel unable to report anything that has happened to them. It is difficult for a child to come forward and report any type of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">One story in the report relates to Vincent who decided to travel to Rosslare in Wexford at the age of 17 or 18 to find summer work. He arrived in Wexford by bus on Friday evening in the late 1980s and was looking for directions to a youth hostel. He noticed a priest, who turned out to be Fr. Seán Fortune, standing on the pavement. He trusted Fr. Fortune like he would a garda or any citizen because the priest was an upstanding man in the community. People should read about how Vincent was treated over that weekend, after which he was given money for his return bus fare. However, it was only when he saw the programme "Suing the Pope" that he told his story. This is one of many stories of young people and people in their late teens trusting an upstanding man in the community. On seeing the programme, it took courage for this man to report the incident. Any child or teenager who has been abused and who may now be in their 20s or 30s should come forward and report any incident because without their courage and strength, we would not be debating this report this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">While there are many fine organisations working in the field of child abuse, there is huge confusion at present in regard to reporting of abuse. For example, there are currently in the region of 17 organisations offering services to victims of abuse. The Government set up the commission to inquire into child abuse, which I welcome. There is also the Residential Institutions Redress Board, the National Office for Victims of Abuse, Comhar, the national counselling service operated by the Health Service Executive and many voluntary groups, such as the Samaritans, One in Four and so on. These organisations are doing excellent work in trying to help victims of child sexual abuse. However, we could improve the situation for them if there was one central organisation, which was funded by the Government, instead of one group looking for funding of €70,000 and another looking for funding of €100,000 just to remain in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">A central organisation should be set up which would have a helpline number like the ambulance service or the Garda. There should be a helpline number such as 999 or 111 and when a child rings up, he or she should be treated with the utmost respect, urgency, integrity and professionalism. I am not saying that the existing organisations are not dealing with child sexual abuse issues in a professional manner, they are doing so. However, as we have seen from the Ferns Report, people were afraid to report incidents. Some people did not even know where to go to report an incident. I call on the Minister to investigate the matter and come to some conclusions because he has the back-up to do so. This service should be funded and advertised in schools, on billboards, etc., so that every child is aware of how to report these incidents. If one asked children in primary school the number for the fire brigade, ambulance service or Garda, they would all know that it is 999. They should also be aware of a number to call if they are being abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Other countries such as the UK have many fine organisations. I refer here to Childline. These services can be very successful if they are provided with a helpline. I have no doubt that if such a service is well advertised, children and victims will know where to go. Mr. Justice Murphy made a similar recommendation in his report. He also noted the reluctance of some of the victims to report incidents to the authorities. People think that if they go to the Garda, the health service or wherever, everyone will know what has happened. The service will work if it is operated in a professional manner. The report also notes the efforts being made to reduce this reluctance by enhancing public confidence in the reporting and investigative system. I believe the public will have confidence in such a service. People will have the confidence to pick up the phone and speak to someone.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I ask the Minister to take note of what has been said. I compliment Bishop Eamonn Walsh, the apostolic administrator of the diocese of Ferns, who has done excellent work in the diocese. I have no doubt he will ensure that the Ferns Report and the church's recommendations will be implemented fully. He has done great work in child protection in County Wexford in setting up a group within the church, for which he must be complimented.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The people of Wexford want to move on from here. They will continue to give the excellent church leaders, including priests and those who carry out pastoral duties, 100% support. I call on the people of Wexford to continue that support for the priests of the diocese because there are some excellent priests in the diocese. Again, I empathise and sympathise with the victims referred to in the report. We would not have this report if they had not come forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_759">Like many of my colleagues, I also begin by paying tribute to all those who came forward to speak to the inquiry and outline the appalling abuse they suffered over a number of years. As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said, these courageous people have offered the inquiry, and Irish society as a whole, a crucial, though harrowing insight into the nature and extent of this problem and the lasting trauma that undoubtedly it can cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The witnesses who came forward have shown the strength of character and courage which has also been evident to all of us who met with survivors of abuse over the years. I wish to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to them because, without their statements, the report would not have been compiled.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">As others have done, I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Murphy and his team. As well as increasing public awareness and understanding of the horror of child sex abuse the report he and his team has produced provides practical and far-reaching recommendations to strengthen child protection measures. Their extremely beneficial work must be recognised. I pay tribute also to a former Member, George Birmingham, an eminent senior counsel who did a preliminary inquiry which laid the foundation for this inquiry. He deserves a great deal of thanks from all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">I preface my remarks by offering a word of support to those priests who have done no wrong. They too deserve our support and sympathy at this difficult time. They have been badly let down by a small number of their colleagues in a most evil fashion. I too welcome the statement by the church authorities that they intend to introduce the inter-agency review as well as the current Ferns model in all areas. I was heartened to hear two members of the Catholic hierarchy, Bishop Willie Walsh of Killaloe and the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, this morning putting to rest any lingering doubts we might have about the earnestness of the Roman Catholic hierarchy's wish to co-operate with all the inquiries. If there was any lingering doubt about the primacy of State law over Canon Law, I hope it has been laid to rest. I think there was some concern in certain quarters that the tenets of Canon Law may, in certain circumstances, take primacy over State law.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The Ferns Report makes for some extremely disturbing reading. The stark reality of the abuse suffered by children and young people and the lack of support and assistance provided to these people at their time of greatest need was in a culture of secrecy, bullying, dominance and over-bearance by the clergy involved in this horrific abuse. The victims, children of all ages, suffered the most awful forms of sexual, physical and psychological abuse at the hands of these clergy. Furthermore, they suffered in silence. Betrayal and inaction on the part of the church meant the church placed the protection of the most vulnerable below their concerns to protect themselves and the church. Were it not for the courage of people such as Colm O'Gorman we would probably still be in the area of guesswork.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The report has had a major effect on the country as a whole. People are appalled, shocked and dismayed at the extent of the abuse outlined and the lack of response by those in charge. Its content has struck at the very core of our society, particularly given that those who carried out the abuse were figures who held responsible positions in society and who commanded trust and respect from all of us. It is clear from the report of the Ferns Inquiry that there was a general failure to recognise the terrible hurt and damage child sexual abuse can and does cause to victims and their families. Deputy Keogh cited one example but one can read other accounts whether families were broken and children were no longer trusted and loved by their parents in some cases. It is clear that prompt and effective action was not taken to protect vulnerable children over a period of many years. It is clear that child protection was way down the list of priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">As a society we must learn from the mistakes of the past and never allow what happened then to happen again. Our job in Government and as Members is to protect those within our country who cannot protect themselves. There have been shortcomings in the past. However, the abuse that has come to light in recent years and is so starkly outlined in the Ferns Report dictates that it simply cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Developments have occurred under successive Governments during the past 15 years which have gone a considerable distance towards protecting our children. Educating our children on this type of abuse has been a priority of Government and the Department of Education and Science, in particular, in ensuring a high level of awareness and the necessary skill to address child protection issues is maintained in all schools. The Department has introduced child protection guidelines for primary and post-primary schools and has clearly defined procedures for reporting allegations or suspicions of child abuse. We have also sought to raise awareness of the issue in the school curriculum through the very good social, personal and health education and Stay Safe programme. It is a matter of concern that there are some schools that are not in a position to implement the Stay Safe programme. Whatever reticence there is should be addressed and clear positions should be adopted for the implementation of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The programme aims to reduce the vulnerability to child abuse through the provision of excellent in-service training for teachers, parent education and personal safety education for children at primary level. The programme aims to provide children with the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse and teaches them always to speak out about any situation they find unsafe, threatening or abusive. It is a personal safety and skills programme which can be used with school children from senior infants to sixth class. It seeks to enhance children's self-protective skills by participating in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, touches, secrets, telling and strangers. Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of bullying. That is one area that is not sufficiently addressed in the Stay Safe programme and may have emerged as a bigger issue since the Stay Safe programme was first drawn up. Notwithstanding these developments we cannot be complacent and must continually strive to put in place better safeguards to ensure the levels of abuse outlined in the Ferns Report can never happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The youth work sector, the non-formal education sector, has led the way. I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, who has overseen the introduction of first-class training programmes for youth workers, both full-time and volunteers. Organisations such as Catholic Youth Care in Dublin, the National Youth Council, the National Youth Federation and others, including the scouting organisations, have introduced programmes. If nothing else, such programmes can reassure participants, young children and young adults and especially parents that children are not at risk when they participate in out of school education. The practical guidelines have been touched on by a number of speakers. Nonetheless it is important to address them over and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">On the issue of vetting procedures by the Garda, whatever resources, training or overarching mechanisms are required should be given to the Garda to ensure, in respect of those who work with young people, whether in a residential or community setting, that under no circumstances can a situation be allowed to develop where, because of trying to spare a few euro under a particular budget, somebody will suffer the satanic type of abuse outlined in the Ferns Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The fundamental imperative of all our actions must be the protection of the child. It is the duty of the Government to ensure that child protection practices are in place, stay in place and are continually monitored. Our duty as a Government and as a nation is to ensure these protection practices operate to the highest possible standard. If such horrific actions are to be prevented in future we must all work together to ensure every possible area is covered and that all recommendations are enforced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_771">Three years ago, an inquiry was established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Frank Murphy with simple and straightforward terms of reference, unlike those for the inquiry into the Dublin archdiocese that has recently been established. The first of these terms was:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_772">To identify what complaints or allegations have been made against clergy operating under the aegis of the Diocese of Ferns in relation to alleged events that transpired prior to 10 April 2002 and to report on the nature of the response to the identified complaints or allegations on the part of the Church authorities and any public authorities to which complaints or allegations were reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">I pay tribute to all the victims who suffered and then courageously came forward and spoke up, thereby making the inquiry so successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The inquiry carried out its works effectively and comprehensively. It identified approximately 100 complaints against 21 priests and detailed many of the horrific sexual assaults committed on young boys and girls in the Ferns diocese over long periods. Some 66 serious allegations of intimidation, sexual assault, rape and buggery were made against the notorious Fr. Seán Fortune. He was not removed from his ministry by either Bishop Herlihy or Bishop Comiskey but was moved from parish to parish. To compound the matter, he was not removed from the chair of the board of management of Ballymurn national school. He was even allowed to open youth clubs and build reconciliation rooms for young people in the basement of his house. Similarly, Canon Clancy was allowed to assault and rape young girls aged from nine to 15 for a period of almost 30 years from 1965 to 1992. He was also allowed remain on in ministry and, as manager of the local national school, he used his position to gain access to young girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">One of the disturbing findings by the inquiry was that "at various points in time during that period, members of the Garda, the teaching profession, the medical profession and the Church were aware of rumours and suspicious concerning Canon Clancy but no action was ever taken against him". I could give a number of other examples but the ones I have given are sufficient to highlight the abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The report addresses a number of the recommendations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The astonishing aspect of the current state of the criminal law is that the superiors, who connived or were negligent in the cover-up of crimes committed by religious against children, appear to have committed no criminal offence. I do not believe that any of us appreciated that when we passed the Criminal Law Act 1997, abolishing what seemed to many to be the arcane offence of misprision of felony, we eliminated the possibility of a criminal offence having been committed in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The report recommends consideration of a new criminal offence of "reckless endangerment". This would be modelled on a 2002 amendment to the Massachusetts criminal code, which provides that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_778">Whoever wantonly or recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child or wantonly or recklessly fails to take reasonable steps to alleviate such risk where there is a duty to act shall be punished by imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than 2 1/2 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">This seems to be the basis of the Minister's proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Labour Party wholeheartedly supports this recommendation, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has promised to insert as an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. However, the Government needs to consider whether this is adequate. The creation of an offence along these lines will punish the individual who recklessly creates a situation of risk for children or who fails to alleviate the risk where there is a duty to act. However, it does not, of itself, create the duty to act and so the Government needs to consider on whom such a duty to act should be imposed. Related to this is the vexed question of mandatory reporting of crimes against children. Even with a new offence of reckless endangerment and even when we succeed in identifying those on whom there should be imposed a duty to act, it will remain the case that one could eliminate the risk of the future endangerment of a child while covering up that a child has already fallen victim to an act of sexual abuse committed by a known individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Mr. Justice Murphy says he did not consider the question of mandatory reporting since his terms of reference confined him to examining the practices of the Roman Catholic Church and such a practice had already been adopted on a voluntary basis by the church in 1996. In the absence of the benefit of recommendations from Mr. Justice Murphy we must work out an approach to this issue. Doing so has divided the Government parties in the past. In this regard, I oppose any blanket proposal that would compromise the ability of health professionals to provide therapeutic and other services to their patients. However, where a person is in a position of authority over another person, whether that authority is spiritual or temporal, and has information about crimes of abuse involving children committed by that other person, then the person in authority should be under a legal obligation to report those crimes. A failure or refusal to report such crimes, without reasonable excuse, should be an offence. While a reasonable excuse for not reporting might be that the victim is now an adult and will take no part in an investigation or prosecution, the general rule should be that those in authority should be obliged to disclose.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The State agencies in the Ferns diocese did not exactly cover themselves in glory. The inquiry found that the response of the South Eastern Health Board was inconsistent and inadequate in terms of support for the victims. The response of the Garda Síochána was also inconsistent and inadequate up to 1990 and many critical Garda files have completely disappeared. The response of the DPP was minimalist and "a prosecution was initiated by the DPP only where there were multiple alleged victims of an accused or in one case, where there was one victim and the incident was witnessed by family members". It was not until 1991 that the Child Care Act put children first and stated that the State must "regard the welfare of children as the first and paramount consideration".</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The SAVI report of 2002 indicated that despite the extent of clerical child sexual abuse that prevailed in the Ferns diocese, 96% of child sexual abuse in Ireland is not clerical abuse. I compliment Colm O'Gorman and his team for the excellent and professional work that the One in Four group does. The 2004 report of that group stated that 27% of Irish women and men have experienced sexual violence as children and that adults who have experienced childhood sexual abuse are 12 times more likely to attempt suicide than those who did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">It is time to grasp the nettle and declare this issue a national priority. It is time to initiate a national campaign to inform parents and professionals dealing with children. It is time to make children aware of their rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> adults in a position of trust and authority over them and to introduce supervisory procedures pertinent to the role of those who work regularly with children. It is time to establish a full Cabinet post of Minister for children’s affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">We should further progress the Ferns Report by referring it to a joint Oireachtas sub-committee, representing the areas of justice, health and education, which would hold a series of hearings, inviting representatives of the victims of child sexual abuse and their respective organisations to tell their stories as we did on release of the Barron report. The sub-committee should also hear from the perpetrators and the relevant State and church agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I welcome the decision to establish a commission of investigation into the archdiocese of Dublin and I also welcome the statement by the Archbishop of Dublin that he will co-operate fully with it. However, I have severe reservations that the commission can carry out its work in the 18 months allocated to it, considering that the non-statutory inquiry into Ferns, a much smaller diocese, took three years. Much preliminary work must also be undertaken before the main investigation can begin and the commission must also be on standby to investigate other dioceses that will require investigation as clear, <i>prima facie </i>evidence of widespread child sexual abuse in certain other dioceses already exists. We will argue these points in more detail when the terms of reference of the commission of investigation are put before the House. From now on, let us put children first.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_787">The Ferns Report made for some very disturbing reading. It details the stark reality of the abuse suffered by young people and the lack of support and assistance at their time of greatest need. I pay tribute to the courageous people who gave evidence of their experience of abuse to the inquiry and express my thanks and appreciation to them. Without their witness, the report could not have reached its findings. I also thank Mr. Justice Frank Murphy and his team for the considerable work undertaken by them in producing this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">It is clear from the report that there was a general failure to recognise the terrible hurt and damage that child sex abuse causes to the victims and their families and that prompt and effective action was not taken to protect vulnerable children over a period of many years. As a society, we must learn from the mistakes of the past and never allow what happened to happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">In addition to increasing public awareness and understanding of the horror of child sex abuse, the Ferns Report provides practical and far-reaching recommendations to strengthen child protection measures in organisations working with children and to ensure a speedy and effective response to allegations of abuse. The Government has accepted the report's recommendations in principle and is committed to their implementation by Departments and relevant agencies. My Department will participate fully in the implementation process which is being driven by the National Children's Office under the leadership of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The fundamental imperative is the protection of the child. Ensuring this requires the full engagement of the Government, the church and the community. Our educational institutions and policies have a key role to play. It is fair to say there has been a major change over the past 15 years in our approach to child abuse. Nonetheless, every effort must be made to preserve and strengthen the more open environment of reporting abuse which has recently developed. While there is a much greater understanding of the horrific nature of child abuse and a much more enlightened approach to treating the problem, it is reasonable to ask, in light of the Ferns Report, whether we are doing enough and whether we can do more to protect children and ensure they grow up in a safe and secure environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">It is vital that we have effective child protection measures in our various educational settings. In recent years we introduced new child protection guidelines for primary and post-primary schools and clearly defined procedures for reporting allegations or suspicions of child abuse. We have also sought to raise awareness of the issue in the curriculum through social, personal and health education, SPHE, the Stay Safe programme and other initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Measures have been in place since 1991 to address child protection and child abuse prevention in schools. The 1991 guidelines were replaced by new child protection guidelines for primary schools which issued in 2001 and child protection guidelines for post-primary schools which issued in 2004. The publications were circulated to all schools, together with a copy of Children First, published by the Department of Health and Children. Each school is obliged to follow the guidelines. They emphasise that the safety and well-being of the child is paramount and that there is an obligation on schools to seek to provide pupils with the highest standard of care in order to promote their well-being and protect them from harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The Department's guidelines set out the steps to be taken by school personnel should they suspect a child is being abused or are aware of allegations that a child is being abused. They also include guidance for boards of management with regard to dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse made about a school employee and for dealing with peer reviews and bullying by young people. A central facet of the guidelines is the requirement for each board of management to designate a senior member of staff as the designated liaison person for the school. That person acts as a liaison with outside agencies such as health boards and as a resource person for any staff member with child protection concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">While dealing with investigations relating to allegations made about a school employee are a matter for the school authorities in the first instance, the Department's position on this is very clear. The person being investigated should not have access to children while the investigation is ongoing. In general, the person is suspended, put on administrative leave or in some cases may go on sick leave. The child must be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Yesterday, I referred in the House to the intention to introduce Garda vetting for all employees who have unsupervised access to children in our schools. Currently, Garda vetting conducted in the formal educational sector is in respect of special needs assistants, bus escorts and children detention schools. Some 17 additional staff, three gardaí and 14 clerical officers are being made available to the unit, bringing the total staff complement to 30. This will enable the unit to handle a greater volume of requests from employers. It will commence the augmentation of the vetting arrangements as soon as it takes up its new offices in Thurles.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The provision of the additional staff resources will enable the Garda vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children. In looking at the position of those with substantial unsupervised access to children and-or vulnerable adults, the issue of how to deal with volunteers and other non-employees with access to children is also being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">It goes without saying that our teachers must be given the appropriate support and training to deal professionally and sensitively with child protection issues. In the past few years training has been provided to primary and post-primary principals and teachers on the implementation of the Department's child protection guidelines and the role of the designated liaison person. Pre-service training is also provided by the colleges of education to ensure new teachers coming on stream are familiar with issues of child protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">We also need to provide support and training for members of boards of management of schools. Over recent years funding has been made available to the various school management bodies for the board of management training. My Department has been developing new funding procedures covering all management bodies according to set criteria, which will include awareness of child protection issues. Support will be provided directly to management bodies to deliver their own training in line with the criteria and to the agreed standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Children nowadays are more confident and aware. Even among them, there is a greater awareness of child abuse as a potential threat. Much of this is due to the more open society in which we live. The curriculum has also moved on and has helped to raise awareness of the issue. Social, personal and health education is one of the seven curriculum areas in the revised primary school curriculum introduced in 1999. It has been implemented in all schools since September 2003 and is taught to pupils from junior infants class up to sixth class. From the beginning of their primary schooling children learn in an age appropriate way how they develop, the importance of caring for oneself and others with dignity and respect and how to identify people, places and situations that may threaten personal safety. For example, the curriculum for third and fourth classes provides for the child being enabled to identify situations where he or she is being touched inappropriately, being asked to keep a difficult secret that is worrying or that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">We also have the Stay Safe programme in primary schools which aims to prevent child abuse. This programme aims to reduce vulnerability to child abuse and bullying through the provision of inservice training for teachers, parent education and personal safety education for children at primary school level. This programme is on offer in the majority of our schools. I encourage those schools that do not offer it to offer it now. It gives children the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse and victimisation. It teaches them that they should always tell of any situation they find unsafe, upsetting, threatening, dangerous or abusive. The programme has also been modified for use with children in special education. It can be of real value to children in all our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">I and my Department are very conscious of the fact that every child in the country attends our schools, from the age of four or five to 18. These children need our protection. We have strict guidelines, rules and procedures. We will continue to keep these under review because the protection of the child is paramount.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_368">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_802">I will share time with Deputy Timmins.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">In the litany of statements today we have heard expressions of sadness, disappointment and, wholly justified in the circumstances, anger. The debate may to some extent have helped to obscure rather than illuminate the issues we are here to discuss. I do not doubt we are talking about a pre-eminent religious organisation in this State. We must not lose sight of the role of the State in delegating and abrogating its authority in respect of the interests of its citizens, whose tragic circumstances are described in the Ferns Report. This House must take its share of the collective responsibility for the problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">In 1972, the people of the State voted to remove the Roman Catholic Church's special position in the Constitution. That change to the Constitution was not followed through with further legislation. The Ferns Report makes clear that the level of deference that was shown to that church by the agencies of the State remained unaltered, unfortunately. Some 25 years after that referendum, State institutions like the Garda Síochána and the health boards acted in a deferential and reverent manner in their dealings with that church, rather than taking the action that should have been taken. It is a source of huge disappointment to me that Irish society did not progress in the manner it should have after 1972. I see signs in today's debate of continuing residues of deference towards the Roman Catholic Church. For example, most Deputies have spoken about "the church", obviously referring to the largest religious organisation in this country. When one considers that its membership includes the vast majority of the Members of the Oireachtas and the citizens of this country, regardless of whether they practise their religious beliefs, it is obvious the Roman Catholic Church is this country's predominant and pre-eminent religious organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The Ferns Report is a damning indictment of the State's failure to put in place a clear distinction between its role and that of the religious organisations. As it tries to prevent further actions which might lead to the publication of future reports like the Ferns Report, the House should be clear about how that distinction needs to be made. The circumstances in which the Roman Catholic Church continues to provide health, education and social services which the State is unwilling to provide must be open to question. In providing many such services and advocating positions of social justice, the Roman Catholic Church articulates positions of real social justice of which the Government has lost sight. That church can be over-concerned about matters of sexual propriety, however. The contents of reports like the Ferns Report have demonstrated to us that the Roman Catholic Church no longer has any moral justification for using its influential position in Irish society to make such arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">When we discuss the Roman Catholic Church, we are not talking about "the church" but about "a church". I am concerned about the State's role and relations with that church. I question that church's future role in the educational system. I would like to ask the Minister for Education and Science, who has left the Chamber, why it continues to be the case, 33 years after the constitutional referendum to which I referred, that the patronage of the vast bulk of our national schools is automatically vested in this particular church. Why should we not have a debate on how we can make our educational system more democratic?</p>

          <p eId="para_809">I would like to use the short time available to me to speak about the role of the State, particularly in respect of mandatory reporting. Members of the House have received copies of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's most recent report, which mentions that mandatory reporting has been advocated in no less than five reports over the last 15 years. It was recommended in the Law Reform Commission's report on child sexual abuse in 1990, the report of the Kilkenny incest inquiry in 1993, the Kelly Fitzgerald report in 1996, the report of the Madonna House inquiry in 1996 and the Ferns Report in 2005. We have seen 15 years of inaction on foot of the reports, however, as no legislation has been presented to the House. No steps have been taken at political level by any of the Governments which have been in office during that time, to provide for mandatory reporting. The failure of successive Administrations to take action in this regard is a terrible indictment of our political system.</p>

We need to be honest in this House, but many Members have not been honest today, unfortunately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_815">I thank Deputy Boyle for sharing time. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well with the grave and serious task he faces. If, over the next year or so, he addresses the issues which have been raised in the Ferns Report, he will certainly "have done the State some service". I caution him not to restrict himself to the narrow but necessary confines of the Ferns Report and its recommendations, which comprise the tip of the iceberg in respect of this serious situation. I will not defend the case of the church because I accept that what happened was absolutely appalling. We should remember, however, that the exact same thing happened in many other organisations, such as the boy scouts and many sporting groups. I ask the Minister of State not to put all his energies into an examination of the church. He should look outside the box. When he introduces new legislative measures, he should ensure that they apply to every organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">During a debate about the Kilkenny incest case in the Seanad in July 1993, the then Minister for Health said "at that time the procedures which are now in place for the detection and investigation of sexual abuse had not been developed". Ten years on, we are discussing the abuse of many young people in the Ferns diocese. Many of the people in question were abused when they were teenagers, rather than when they were kids. They reported the abuse in the early part of this decade after Bishop Walsh established the Ferns Inquiry. Many of us who are speaking as part of this debate are in a comfort zone because a report has been published and recommendations have been made. When we have finished expressing our horror at the contents of the report and saying that it must not happen again, we can close the book in the knowledge that someone else is looking after the matter and we can move on to the next project.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I was very angry after I received a copy of the Ferns Report. I read the first 20 pages of it, skipped through the rest of it and read its recommendations this evening. I was not angry because of the contents of the report, but because I believe child abuse, which is the subject of the report, is still happening in this country this evening. I am sure that as I speak, some young child is being abused. He or she does not know what is happening to him or her. That abuse is being facilitated by our society's shortcomings, such as its failure to recognise and deal with this issue. The Seanad was told in 1993 that proper procedures were "in place", but it is obvious that was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I would like to refer to some aspects of the Ferns Report, such as its reference to the "powerlessness" of children. We all went to secondary school. I knew St. Peter's College in Wexford well — I played football against that school — and it always struck me as a normal school. It is troubling to think that students in the school, who were then aged 14, 15 or 16, were terrified because things were happening to them and they could not report it. The Ferns Report states that child sexual abuse may be committed by people of apparent charm, intelligence and high repute. It is obvious that paedophiles are not normal, but they are manipulative. People who abuse children are not those whom one might suspect as being engaged in such behaviour. It is possible for a paedophile to pass as an outstanding and righteous member of society. The report mentions that people who have a propensity to sexually abuse children are attracted to careers which give them easy access to children.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_820">It is terrible that I have to conclude after such a short time because I have a few more important points to make to the Minister of State, to whom I do not attach any blame. I received one of the most traumatic telephone calls of my life from a person in my constituency last week. The person did not know where he could go or to whom he could turn. A publicity campaign is needed to publicise the number of a telephone line that victims of clerical and institutional abuse can ring. A few months ago, I spotted an individual, whose photograph appeared in newspapers in the last few weeks, in a public place where children were present. I knew at that time that the man in question was a child abuser who had been given a jail sentence. I am not saying the man in question was doing anything wrong, but it sent a shiver down my spine.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Mechanisms must be put in place whereby people who hold positions of authority, be they in business or in charge of child facilities, know who these people are when they are out in the community. This is very important. I regret that I must finish. We must put mechanisms in place so people can report child abuse. We have a difficulty in this country with the concept of informing but a person who reports on harm to children is a true patriot. We must also educate our children.</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_822">The Ferns Report is a contemporary Pandora's box, containing as it does, distressing accounts and narratives of innocence destroyed, vulnerability exploited and power abused. However, it also carries hope for the future. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well in the important work that lies before him. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_823">The members of the Inquiry would express the hope that should the type of abuse chronicled in this Report ever occur again, there will be mechanisms and procedures in place which will enable victims promptly to report the abuse in the confidence that they would be believed and the certainty that appropriate action would be taken to terminate the wrongdoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">That really sums up what this is all about. The Ferns Report is a distressing document, relying as it does on the simplest of print formats to present its harrowing and disturbing account of, on the one hand, a hidden Ireland, and on the other, an Ireland where attempts to uncover wrongdoing went unheeded and often not believed.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">It is impossible to talk about the Ferns Report without referring in some meaningful way to the accounts relating to victims and alleged victims of clerical abuse. In fact, not to do so would be to do a disservice to those who have shown such bravery in coming forward and telling their stories. What is painfully clear from the Ferns Report and from evidence generally is that not all victims of sexual abuse lived to survive their ordeal. Some were so badly scarred that, sadly, they took their own lives. What a truly horrendous price to pay — loss of innocence and loss of life. One of the most disturbing aspects of the Ferns Report is the many accounts of how children had brought their abuse to the attention of elders, respected elders and people in positions of authority, but were not believed or were discredited.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">One example of this is Stephen, whose abuser, the now deceased Fr. Seán Fortune, continually abused him from the age of 13, culminating in violent rape. Stephen courageously reported the abuse to the principal of St Peter's College who "reacted angrily to him and refused to believe him". What is a child to do in these circumstances? What avenue is left open to people who, when they report such abuse it is simply brushed aside? Stephen made his complaint under the threat from Fr. Fortune that he would be expelled from the college, a fate that according to the devious Fr. Fortune, would "cause great hurt to his parents". This, among many other incidents outlined in the report, indicates abusers who knew very well, all too well, the power and influence they held over those in their care, for long or short periods of time. Fr. Fortune and others abused their position of responsibility within the community and abused their roles as pastors, their relationship with their parishioners and above all, abused innocent boys whose only failing was to trust those in positions of authority, in whom society had placed its trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">This report provides us with a vividly distressing account of how abuse took place, where it took place and how it was perpetrated in its many manifestations. The Ferns Report tells us fundamentally about innocence abused and trust and respect misplaced. It tells us also of the overriding priority that the protection of the institution took over the protection of children. Like others, I acknowledge and appreciate the work of Mr. Justice Murphy, Dr. Buckley and Dr. Joyce. I also commend Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and Bishop Eamonn Walsh for their leadership roles in this sad episode. I also avail of this opportunity to commend and offer words of support and encouragement to the many clergy who have toiled so courageously and selflessly over generations and whose reputations have been collectively tarnished by association.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I wish to reply briefly to comments made by Deputy O'Donnell who said earlier that the special relationship with the Catholic Church must end. The Catholic Church does not have a special relationship with the State based on its creed. It is true that in its role as a provider of services in education and health it has a partnership role like other religious organisations. The days are thankfully long gone when an archbishop would have a quiet word in the ear of a Minister before the Government would introduce legislation. In Ireland of 2005 we do not prioritise the Catholic Church over any other church and I could not see myself being part of any Government that would do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">I make these comments at a time when the State is undertaking an important process of church-State dialogue, an institutional dialogue not just with the Christian churches, Catholic, Protestant and eastern Orthodox churches, but also the Islamic community, Buddhists and the Humanist Association of Ireland among others. This dialogue which is being established by the Taoiseach's Department will take place between the State on the one hand and church and faith based communities and non-confessional organisations on the other. This is a healthy, progressive and even historic development, reflecting the Ireland of today which, as we all know, is a multi-ethnic and multicultural society.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I have no doubt that these organisations, churches and individuals with their wealth of experience and knowledge will assist us greatly in developing our policies into the future. We already engage successfully and productively with the social partners and many non-governmental organisations in the formulation of Government policy. This new form of dialogue will be in all our interests. I make these comments to clarify as far as I am concerned the true relationship between the Catholic Church and the State. This dialogue is taking place in the spirit of article 52 of the proposed European constitutional treaty. We are the first member state of the European Union to take this step. Structured dialogue with the churches offers the opportunity to listen anew in an open and transparent way to the inner voice in the Irish and European tradition. The constitutional reference to the Catholic Church is long gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The Ferns Inquiry exposes failures on many fronts, by the church, the State, the Garda and our health and educational systems. A collective effort is required to ensure we do not fail in future. In my opening remarks I referred to the hope expressed in the Ferns Report that should such sexual abuse as chronicled in this report ever occur again, adequate and appropriate procedures and mechanisms would be in place that would enable victims to promptly report the abuse in the confidence that they would be believed. I am convinced the Government has taken the correct approach. The announcements made yesterday by my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will put procedures in place to deal as comprehensively as possible with this important matter and will provide the highest possible level of protection for our children. This will require a collective effort by us all.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_832">In the short time left I thank Deputies for the high level of interest shown in this debate and for their constructive contributions. In particular, I record my thanks to the many Deputies who wished me well in the task to be performed by my Department, the Health Service Executive and other statutory agencies in the implementation of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The Government intends to implement all of the recommendations of the Ferns Report. I was delighted to hear this commands universal support and encouragement from within this House. Naturally, questions were asked about certain matters. I am very short on time but I wish to make the point that the key recommendation in the Ferns Inquiry is the establishment of the inter-agency approach at diocesan level. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has often discussed and elucidated the culture of confidentiality and secrecy to which some aspects of Canon Law have led. It is clear that the establishment of the inter-agency group at diocesan level will ensure a culture of openness, the assessment of information and co-operation with the civil authority will take place once that machinery is put in place. That is why I attach enormous importance to that recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Deputies were naturally concerned that we do not have universal vetting in terms of negative criminal clearance of all persons who have unsupervised access to children. The position is that we only started having vetting in 2001. We have made considerable progress since then in extending it to the entire health sector. I am pleased to say that I secured the necessary staff last year to extend the service. Premises have been identified in Thurles and the office is due to open next week. I understand the service will be rolled out on a phased basis to all the other sectors. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, outlined her plans in regard to the education sector. The voluntary sector is also very important in this context. I thank Mr. Paul Gilligan, the chief executive officer of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children who is working on the implementation group on the vetting proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Naturally the debate was considerably wider than the Ferns Report, which is welcome. It would not have been open to me as Minister of State to go into some of those wider questions, as my focus must necessarily be on the recommendations in the report, but given the unanimous support the recommendations commanded it is no surprise that Deputies availed of the opportunity to canvass wider questions about the relationship between the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church and the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Before going into that question I wish to deal with a matter raised by Deputy Mulcahy that was not specifically in regard to the Ferns Report but related to the commission of inquiry announced for the Dublin archdiocese. The difficulty is that some line must be drawn in regard to inquiries. We have all had a particular experience in this House in regard to inquiries into planning matters and how the setting of certain terms of reference can lead to an inquiry that appears to go in many directions. Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I are anxious to ensure the focus of this inquiry is clearcut.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMulcahyFF" eId="spk_380">
            <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
            <p eId="para_837">I thank Members of the Opposition for tabling this motion on an important matter but it is based on a false premise. It notes that 323 persons have been killed on our roads in the first ten months of 2005. However, there is no mention in the motion of the substantial increase in car registrations. If one goes over the number of roads deaths in recent years and the number of new car registrations, one would come to the reasonable conclusion that the number of road deaths as a percentage of cars on the road is decreasing. In the period 1998 to 2004, there were 40% more vehicles on our roads. There were 472 fatalities on our roads in 1997, 458 in 1998, 413 in 1999, 415 in 2000, 411 in 2001, 376 in 2002, 335 in 2003, 374 in 2004, which is a provisional figure, and 326 so far in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">One life lost on our roads is one too many. We should not look at this problem in an abstract way. It is a scandal and a shame that anyone is injured on the roads. As a Government backbencher, I do not mind saying the Government could do even more in this area. I am not convinced that the resources have been applied by this or previous Governments. Is anything more important than road safety and people's lives and health?</p>
            <p eId="para_839">Another criticism I have of the motion is that it does not mention something which will be the greatest contributor to road safety, namely, the new transport plan, Transport 21. With a network of hugely improved roads, I have no doubt that there will be a massive decrease in the number of road injuries and fatalities. If the Opposition was a little bit more mature, the motion would have welcomed the new transport plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The EU third road safety action plan has set a target of a 50% reduction in road deaths across the EU by 2010 but that is not enough. We can do better than that. I genuinely believe this issue should be at the top of every EU government's agenda. However, it is not only a matter for central government. Local authorities have a critical role to play in regard to the design and construction of roads. They also have a role to play in regard to lighting and signage on roads. Local authorities throughout this country fail miserably under those headings.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">There is no question but that the penalty points system has had a beneficial impact. There are four categories to which it applies but I would like the number of categories to which it applies greatly expanded. I welcome the Opposition raising this issue but its motion is lacking in credibility and honesty and I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p>

            <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
            <p eId="para_842">It gives me no pleasure to discuss the issue of road safety on the basis that I come from an area which has endured a significant number of roads deaths over the past 18 months. Deputy Mulcahy said one life lost is one too many. If Deputies had attended as many corpse houses of young people under the age of 23 or 24 as I have, it would focus minds on the fact we all have a responsibility to ensure all those on the roads at the same time as us are safe. In one sense, I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on this issue but it raises the question for me and for the many people in my constituency who are grieving having lost someone and wondering what we could have done to prevent these deaths. If events have had one result, they have focused people's minds in my area on that question. I do not believe any one approach or any one Government will provide a solution to this issue. We must take a broader approach. We probably need pilot schemes in particular areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">An issue which is not helping is the fact the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government deals with certain roads while the Department of Transport deals with others. I tried to get fluorescent bands placed around the base of traffic islands so that if the lights failed for whatever reason, the car light would reflect on the band. Each time I asked the Department of Transport, I was told it was the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and when I asked that Department, I was told it was up to the county councils. Each county council has the right to make a decision in that regard. There is also the question of whether roads funding and other issues relating to roads should be the responsibility of one Department instead of being split between at least two Departments. Perhaps that would result in a better focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">The recent speed limit changes have resulted in speed limits on some roads being too high while being too low on other roads. The speed limits are not realistic. There should be some way to expedite the process whereby roads, particularly on which speed limits are the equivalent of 50 km/h, are brought back to 60 km/h where appropriate conditions are met. There is no point looking for the traffic corps to implement speed limits which are unrealistic.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">I welcome the recent assignment of a traffic corps to my peninsula. I am glad it is focusing on the real issues. On its first weekend, it caught seven drunk drivers. People must know they will be caught. However, that is not the only issue. There is no point always going out with a big stick. People must have a sense of responsibility. When we are driving, our passengers and ourselves must feel safe and other drivers must get a sense that we respect ourselves and others. Car safety programmes are in place in Sweden, an issue I will raise with the Departments of Transport, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science. A successful programme is being run in Sweden on passenger safety with the intention of awarding passenger licences. It is aimed at primary schools so that as children are growing they develop a better understanding of the implications of speeding and carelessness on the road. We should consider such novel programmes adopted by other countries in the context of road safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">Drink and drug driving must constantly be tackled. My committee had a debate on the increasing use of drugs earlier. If fatalities or serious injury are caused by a road crash, the drivers involved should be mandatorily breath tested. Advanced driving courses are needed. While the cost of car insurance has decreased, which is welcome given the difficulties experienced by young drivers, insurance should be used to encourage people to improve their driving on the basis that if they drive well, their premia will be reduced. That is a carrot as opposed to a big stick. More interaction is needed between the Garda and our youth on the issue of responsible driving. Driving lessons for transition year students on school grounds have been suggested. They can learn to drive in a confined, safe environment and develop good driving practices. Designated safe areas for young people to drive at speed have also been suggested so that they can get their adrenaline rush. Young people driving dangerously in souped up cars is a desperate problem and they are a danger to other drivers. The Department of Transport should be responsible for all roads issues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_382">
            <from>Mr. Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_847">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I am sad and disappointed that 326 people have lost their lives on our roads so far this year. I know a number of the victims and their families. Numbers can be cold because they do not adequately reflect the significant suffering families endure. I recently visited the family of a 16 year old girl in my area who was the victim of a hit and run accident. No words can adequately express the grief the family is experiencing. However, in addition to the fatalities, a significant number of people have also suffered horrific, life changing injuries and they must also be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">While the annual number of fatalities on our roads increased from 335 in 2003 to 374 last year, as Deputy Mulcahy stated, it must be borne in mind that there is an ever increasing number of vehicles on the roads. Approximately 1,000 new vehicles are put on the road weekly. The introduction of the penalty points system resulted in a radical change in driver behaviour and attitudes and this led to the reduction in road fatalities in 2003, which was the lowest number for 40 years. While the number increased last year, it did not increase to the level experienced in the late 1990s. For example, there were 452 fatalities in 1997 and 458 in 1998, despite the increasing number of cars on our roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Perhaps we should examine a number of factors that have contributed to the improvement. The penalty points system has had a beneficial effect. The safety standard of new motor cars is improving all the time with new cars having more safety features. The national car test ensures older cars are better looked after. Many roads have been improved considerably in recent years and awareness and education campaigns have had a positive effect. Garda activity has increased with the establishment of the traffic corps being particularly welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The question is often asked during debates on road safety about whether additional speed cameras would be a deterrent. I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and approximately one year ago we had an interesting meeting with officials of the Department of Transport and members of the Garda. We examined the operation of the existing speed camera system and one of the committee's clear findings was that the high visibility of mobile Garda patrols was beneficial. The committee was of the opinion that such patrols were the greatest deterrent. I am particularly pleased, therefore, that the Garda traffic corps, which was only established one year ago, will increase in size rapidly over the next number of years. By the end of this year, it is expected to comprise 563 members and it will comprise 805 by the end of 2006, which I welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">I have a reservation about the effectiveness of the GATSO vans used by the Garda. They often pull in beside main roads picking on soft targets. Garda enforcement should be targeted more at secondary roads, which are not designed to be driven on at high speeds, yet cars are driven at the speed limit of 100 km/h or above on these roads. Garda resources should be targeted at these roads. Other Members mentioned that local authorities have conducted reviews of speed limits and I agree they are still out of line with the standard of the roads. I visited County Cavan recently and travelled on a secondary road with a speed limit of 100 km/h. However, when I met an oncoming car, I had to pull into the ditch because there was not enough room for two cars. Appropriate speed limits and adequate enforcement are needed. The Garda concentrates too much on main roads when enforcing traffic laws. Many road accidents involving younger drivers take place at night on secondary roads where they drive at high speeds. The Garda needs to be more targeted in its approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The number of road fatalities in recent years indicates the introduction of penalty points had a significant initial impact but, like many other initiatives, its impact has waned. The extension of the penalty points system must be accompanied with education and public awareness campaigns if it is to continue to have the effect it had when it was introduced.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimGlennonFF" eId="spk_383">
            <from>Mr. Glennon</from>
            <p eId="para_853">Like my colleagues, while I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute on this important topic, it does not give me satisfaction to have to deal with it. I am interested in the number of road fatalities in recent years. In 2003 there were 335 deaths on the road, compared to 472 in 1997. When one takes into account the number of additional vehicles on the road over that period the statistic is particularly striking. Any death from negligence is unacceptable but our task as legislators is to ensure the least possible number of deaths on the roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">It is significant that the introduction of penalty points in 2003 coincided with the least number of deaths. Penalties are the key to this issue and penalty points prove that. I do not agree with Deputy Curran on high-visibility Garda presence. The primary function of gardaí is investigating accidents rather than preventing them. Penalties are the means of prevention. Random breath testing for all drugs, including alcohol, cannot be introduced quickly enough. As a member of the Committee on Transport I look forward to discussions in a few weeks between the Minister for Transport and the Opposition spokespersons on the introduction of random breath testing. I hope it will be introduced for all drugs including alcohol, which tends to be overlooked but must be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">More stringent penalties must be considered and a system of impounding and confiscating vehicles after accidents must be examined. We must consider mandatory sentencing for certain offences and, in some instances, the removal of the option of suspension of sentences. Yesterday, a large proportion of a sentence was suspended and suspended sentences do not appear to have the deterrent impact on the public that good sentencing should have. We must examine this beyond road traffic offences. Many constituents have made suggestions on the leniency of the Judiciary in road traffic offences, such as dangerous driving or technical offences involving tax or insurance. Inconsistency and leniency exist in respect of these.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">I congratulate a constituent of mine who has fought a long campaign on the evil of drunken driving, Ms Gertie Shields. She is the chairperson of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Ms Shields suffered a personal loss that drove her to involvement in this campaign. She is not involved in the politics of the most recent tragedy. Her campaign is ongoing as ours should be.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PeterKellyFF" eId="spk_384">
            <from>Mr. Kelly</from>
            <p eId="para_857">This has been an interesting debate on an important subject. Despite the recent upsurge in road deaths, I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the marked improvement in road safety. The culture has started to change. Since the introduction of the first national road safety strategy, 1997-98, a change has taken place. Death and carnage on the roads was costing the country a significant amount of money and was taking a toll on families and individuals. I express my sympathy to all bereaved families. It is very sad to learn of road deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">In the past, injury and death was a common occurrence. Every morning brought news of two or three accidents and something had to be done. The initiative was taken by the previous Administration in publishing the road safety strategy in 1997-98. The downward trend of deaths and injuries over past years is proof that a co-ordinated, strategic, properly-funded approach to the education of road users, the design of roads and traffic calming measures, strong enforcement of legislation and ongoing monitoring and research can make travel safe for all road users.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">We are all road users, using footpaths and roadways. It is in everybody's interest that measures are taken to prevent accidents. The current Government and the previous one led the way in the introduction of a dedicated Department of Transport. Raising public awareness is essential in changing attitudes. As we have seen in the campaigns on drink driving, seat belt use and other issues, a well constructed advertising and education campaign, supported by good legislation and strong enforcement, alters the population's attitude.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">One's speed, route and destination are matters of choice and people must take responsibility for their actions. This message has been received over the years and an illustration of the cultural change has been the use of seat belts. For many years, taxi drivers, bus drivers and others in similar occupations would not consider using seat belts. The introduction of rules, making it mandatory to wear a seat belt, has worked despite widespread objections from those who suggested it would not work and would require too much monitoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">Despite recent figures the trend on our roads is one of a steady decline in the number of collisions and injuries. According to independent opinion, fatalities and serious injuries fell significantly in 1998, 1999 and 2002 following the introduction of new road traffic measures. The level of fatalities in 2003 was the lowest since 1964. These decreases coincided with a quadrupling of the number of drivers and vehicles. When the economy started to recover there was a noticeable upsurge in the number of people driving cars. In Ballymahon and Longford town in my constituency I used to see one car parked outside each house. Nowadays I see two, three or four cars parked in the driveways. Given an upsurge in road use it is logical that the number of accidents will increase. Recent measures take this trend into account and the strategy planned for 2004-06 goes further in underpinning them.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">We must maintain the progress that has been made thus far. I congratulate the Government on the investment it has made in improving the roads system. This year an additional €34 million is being invested in our non-national roads. Driving around the country, as most of us do in the course of our work, one cannot escape the noticeable improvements in the road network. Clearly, much work needs to be done on secondary rural roads, but significant strides have been made. The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities, has made significant progress and should be congratulated on doing so.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
            <p eId="para_866">Despite what the previous speaker said, it is probably true to say that in this country the most dangerous place to be is in a car on our roads. I cannot think of any more dangerous place. I want to focus on the issue of road accidents involving heavy trucks. I understand that following all road accidents, the Garda Síochána forwards detailed reports to the National Roads Authority and each local authority to establish accident causes and trends. As well as using these reports, it would be a useful exercise to commission a separate study into accidents involving trucks and to make recommendations based on the findings. I am focusing on trucks for a specific reason. If a car is hit by a heavy truck the strong likelihood is that there will be fatalities and horrific injuries. The fatalities will almost always be among the passengers or driver of the more vulnerable vehicle, namely the car. The truck driver will be either slightly injured or, as we hear so often in news reports of such horrific accidents, suffering from shock.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">We are told that in the region of 15% of fatal road accidents involve trucks. However, what percentage of all accidents involving trucks result in fatalities or serious injuries? I expect the percentage is very high. Despite that, however, it may surprise many road users that the rules of the road specify a speed limit of 80 km/h or 50 mph for trucks and coaches. How many of us see trucks travelling at less than 50 mph? The fact that trucks, which are lethal weapons, ignore these speed limits is a scandal. It is also a scandal that to some degree this problem is being swept under the carpet.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">Many people in control of trucks drive recklessly, irresponsibly and far faster than is permitted or safe for other road users. If they are involved in a road accident, however, the odds are that they will not be injured unless they are unlucky enough to be hit by a heavier truck.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">There is a need to establish the facts concerning truck driving in this country, to discover whether trucks keep within speed limits and whether the law is rigorously enforced. We must ascertain whether additional measures are needed to ensure that the number of people who die or are injured as a result of accidents involving trucks can be reduced.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_389">
            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_870">This motion is welcome. In addressing road safety, the House must have regard to the dangers posed to school children in this regard. It is nothing short of scandalous that school children's lives are being put at risk every day by motorists speeding past schools on primary, secondary, regional and country roads. As matters stands, such drivers can legally fly past schools at speeds of up to 100 km/h, which is approximately 63 mph. It takes 80 yards for a vehicle to come to a halt when travelling at 100 km/h on a dry surface. The corresponding distance is 137 yards on a wet road. It is difficult to control children at the best of times due to their youthful exuberance. It is extremely irresponsible to allow uncontrolled speeding to continue outside national schools where children congregate and interact in a robust manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">In my constituency, a school may be located across the road from sporting facilities, which further endangers the lives of school children. It is frightening for groups of children to have to cross a main road from their school to a football pitch when motorists are travelling at up to 100 km/h. I can imagine no other country where a Government, particularly a Minister for Transport would allow the lives of school children to be put at risk in such a callous manner. Nonetheless, it appears that this reckless situation will not be dealt with immediately. This is because measures to ensure the safety of our school children are delayed to allow designers to produce new road signs.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">A circular has been issued by the Department to local authorities informing them that a standardised sign is being designed. Consequently, local authorities will have to wait for the new design to be unveiled before manufacturers can start to produce the road signs. While awaiting the arrival of the new signs, our school children's lives are put at risk. There is no justification for further procrastination. I urge the Minister to ensure that local authorities can proceed immediately to create controlled speeding zones outside national schools.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_390">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_873">Following the introduction of penalty points approximately two years ago, there was an immediate and welcome reduction in the number of fatal and non-fatal road casualties. This was clearly attributable to the fear of enforcement, financial penalties and increased insurance costs, but when people realised that there was no visible element of enforcement and they could flout the law, the numbers rose again. Laws must be seen to be enforced. If a deranged person continually went into shopping centres at the weekend and shot five or six people while injuring many others, there would be an outcry. In the case of road accidents, however, there has been a meek acceptance of what is happening. When it comes to car crashes, people seem to think, "But for the grace of God, there go I". That is the prevalent attitude. At bank holiday weekends, gardaí maintain high visibility checkpoints. They advise us not to drink and drive, yet each holiday weekend brings its own degree of tragedy on the roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">There are well-known methods for reducing fatalities on the roads and if they can work in other countries there is no reason they cannot be used here. For example, the authorities in New Zealand operate a driver curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which has reduced road accidents. If that measure can have such a dramatic effect in New Zealand we should consider employing that and other ideas that have been tried and test abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">People may experience difficulties finding a taxi to drive them home after attending a social function. Members of my family have had to wait for up to two hours for a taxi and considered themselves lucky when one arrived. People can also be stranded when roads are icy or foggy. Recently, a judge in Monaghan said he was considering not granting late night extensions to premises unless they could prove that a taxi service was available to take people home from such functions. It is unacceptable that late night extensions are granted willy-nilly without provision being made for people to return home safely.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">We must examine road signs in the context of the recent changes from miles to kilometres per hour. A speed limit of 80 km/h is in force on some side roads. One can drive at 80 km/h on those roads where there is only space for two bicycles to meet. One is in danger walking on them as pedestrians regularly have to stand into the ditch. The speed limits on these roads should be lowered. It gives some people a thrill to drive at 80 km/h on a narrow road fit only for single lane traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">In Castleblaney two people were killed crossing the road because they fell into the blind spot of a lorry. We should proactively cover these blind spots, whether by using sensors on lorries or whatever. These factors should be urgently examined because they cause death and will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">There are other anomalies, for example, in the workplace one's skills would occasionally be tested but one gets a driving licence when one is 17 years old that serves for a lifetime. There should be test periods. The only test period applies when one loses one's licence and has to re-sit the driving test.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_879">On 11 October last I asked the Tánaiste why two years on from a promise given by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, random breath testing had not been introduced. In her reply the Tánaiste said "there are complex reasons for the difficulties in this matter". The current Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, added "There are constitutional issues to consider". Since then he has told the Joint Committee on Transport that he is committed to the Government's road safety strategy pledge to introduce random testing by the end of 2006 but insists that the legislation must be legally sound and have all party support.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">I ask the Minister of State to stop the delaying tactics. There are no difficulties on this side of the House, in the same way as there were no difficulties in respect of the ban on smoking in the workplace. The Government had total support, and it has full and unequivocal support from the Green Party and the other Opposition parties to introduce random breath testing.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">The Government should stop making excuses and introduce this measure which will save hundreds of lives. The facts speak for themselves: 33% of all fatal collisions are associated with alcohol consumption. Some 89% of blood and urine assessments, and 81% of breath specimens analysed in 2003 by the medical bureau of road safety were above the alcohol limit for driving. This suggests that many people are driving who are over the limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">When random breath testing was introduced in Victoria, Australia it was an outstanding success and prevented many accidents associated with alcohol. That state has witnessed a dramatic reduction in drivers killed: in 1987, 49% of all drivers killed there were found to be in excess of the alcohol limit but in 1992 that number had been halved. The evidence exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">The Minister of State could this evening pass by a large pub whose car park is full of vehicles. We know that people are consuming alcohol then getting into their cars. If we introduce random breath testing that practice would end and there would be a dramatic reduction in fatalities. That is what must be done. Diageo and other members of the drink industry support random breath testing. Let us forget the pretence. There is no opposition on this side of the House. We will support the Government on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_890">Cycling has not been mentioned but in this city it is extremely dangerous. Transport 21 has not addressed the difficulties that we cyclists must face daily. Many parents will not allow their children cycle to school for obvious reasons. Cycling must at some stage become not just a leisure pursuit but a means of transport, if we are to deal with many problems including global warming.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">The Government must make cycling safe. There are too many fatalities. I have lost too many colleagues and friends in cycling accidents. One talks about the dangers when a truck and car collide but a cyclist has no chance in a collision. I urge the Minister of State to make cycling safe.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_397">
            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_892">The immediate establishment of a road safety authority is probably the most pressing of the proposals in this motion. It would exercise ultimate authority and responsibility for measures and policies in respect of road safety. The current system seems to be confused between the Department of Transport, the National Roads Authority and local authorities. When something goes wrong it is not clear who, if anybody, is responsible or will do anything about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">A recent accident argues the need for this road safety authority starkly. A year ago a young woman was killed in a road accident on the N59 in County Mayo. The events before and after this accident illustrate the problems arising, unless responsibility for implementation and enforcement are clearly defined and under the remit of one body. The stretch of road where the accident happened had only a base course, lacking the essential surface dressing which provides grip and prevents skidding. Despite NRA guidelines which mandate that no white line can be laid until the surface dressing is applied and where the speed limit exceeds 50 km/h, a white line was laid.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">An accident was sure to happen on this stretch of road with a speed limit of 100 km/h. Prior to the fatal accident there was a non-fatal crash, mirroring the circumstances of the later accident but no action appears to have been taken. The road continued to be used at 100 km/h with no signs to warn motorists, resulting in a tragedy that could have been avoided.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">Despite the absence of signs and warnings, Mayo County Council subsequently claimed this was an unfinished stretch of road, which is questionable given the presence of the white lines and the NRA regulations on these. The NRA seems to use this claim as a reason not to get involved. The Health and Safety Authority when consulted refused to become involved, on the basis that no builders' vans or other machinery was present and the road was therefore not a workplace. Any inquiries to the Department of Transport yielded the standard response, namely, that the Minister had no responsibility for this matter as it fell under the remit of the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">This is the strange case of a road that was not quite a road, a completed road that was not completed and work in progress that was not a workplace. It would be funny were it not so tragic. Without wishing to prejudge the report on the Meath school bus tragedy, which has been withheld, similar issues to those I have raised here were mentioned in that inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">To ensure international best practice on our roads in all areas we need a single agency where the buck stops. As long as there is a multi-agency approach with no clear definition of responsibility, issues will continue to be kicked from pillar to post, delays will occur, mistakes will not be rectified and avoidable tragedies will continue to occur. Surely the families of accident victims have enough with which to deal without being sent to different agencies. I support tonight's motion in calling for the immediate introduction of a road safety authority.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_398">
            <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_898">I wish to share time with Deputies Kehoe, Enright, McGinley and Deenihan.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Each year more then 40,000 deaths are caused by road traffic accidents in the EU and, in addition to this unacceptable human suffering, there are substantial direct and indirect costs which have been estimated at €180 billion or 2% of EU GNP.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">This is particularly important while the road safety standards and practices in the new member states are considerably lower than in the EU 15. Fine Gael MEPs in the European Parliament voted in favour of the own-initiative report of our French colleague Ari Vatanen in Strasbourg in September and the subsequent resolution that cross-border enforcement of road traffic law remains very unsatisfactory.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The discrepancies in the highway code between the Republic and Northern Ireland should be of particular relevance to the Government in this regard. Northern Ireland uses the miles per hour unit of measurement while we have recently converted to kilometres. The symbols and signs used in Ireland are almost identical to those in the North, as both jurisdictions have adopted the original British highway code almost directly. I am glad to see the operation of a penalty points system in the North, but what will the Government do to encourage the integration and mutual recognition of the two systems in order to promote cross border road safety? Bilateral action with Northern Ireland on this issue should be a priority. Legal adjustments would be necessary but surely the integration of both systems would not be a very costly task.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">The European Parliament made a number of other very rational and original recommendations. The need for a European framework for safe infrastructure management is one point of interest for us in Ireland. Considering the huge overruns and mismanagement of many road projects which have been a feature of the Government's term in office, I would welcome a framework directive that would ensure Irish taxpayers enjoy the highest possible standards of road safety. The European Parliament resolution also called for the setting up of expert networks enabling the exchange of "best in Europe" approaches to safe road design and management.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">There are four motor technologies that we must consider priorities in our fight to end carnage on the roads. The first involves seat belt reminders and advanced restraint systems. The second is electronic stability control or ESC as it is commonly known. International research is unanimous that the lifesaving potential of ESC is enormous. It is an electronic mechanism that compares a driver's intended course with the vehicle's actual movement, and if instability is detected, ESC can automatically apply brake and reduce engine torque.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The third technology involves speed limitation systems including intelligent speed adaption, ISA. This is a system which, with the use of an in-vehicle digital road map on to which speed limits have been coded, is aware of the permitted or recommended speed for any particular road. Research in Scandinavian countries has shown that the use of ISA could reduce crashes by around 35%. Finally, eCall, an emergency call generated manually by vehicle occupants or automatically via activation of in-vehicle sensors when an accident occurs, has the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatalities and injuries as well as stress in post-crash situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">Some of these new ideas may be known to the House or to the Minister. I raise them for two good reasons. The figure for deaths on the roads so far this year is around 380. Three times as many people have died on the roads as died in Northern Ireland in the same 30-year period. That is a shocking indictment. When we think of all we did to help solve the Northern Ireland problem, which had to be done, we need to do something similar about deaths on the road. We must look at new ideas — if not the ones I mentioned, then others.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">I ask the Minister of State to address one issue in particular when replying. I understand that the statistics of the community road accident database show that on average the number of males killed on our roads is almost triple the number of women. What specific measures is the Government taking to encourage a greater culture of safe driving among men in Ireland, particularly among young men? What can we learn from this and what emphasis is the Minister of State putting on this aspect?</p>
            <p eId="para_907">I commend my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, for tabling this motion. A British Government study recently discovered that around 20% of accidents on long journeys on truck roads and motorways are caused by fatigue. Now that we have motorways, we must address these issues. We must approach this in a different way.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_399">
            <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
            <p eId="para_908">It seems that my party raises the issue of road safety every year. The Government has done nothing about it. The proof is that the number of road accidents and the numbers killed on our roads have increased rather than decreased. The numbers of young people under 30 being killed on the roads increases every year. The Government is not getting the message and is not trying to solve the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">I will give an example of the NRA and a county council at loggerheads over placing road signage. In my constituency this morning an articulated lorry overturned at a roundabout. This is the tenth lorry in recent months to have overturned on this roundabout going into Rosslare harbour. This is a major problem at that location. I was told this evening that although most of the accidents which take place there involve lorries from overseas with overseas drivers, Wexford County Council cannot put up signs in European languages at the approaches to the roundabout. The council has been told that it will take four to five months before the NRA can give it permission to erect any sort of warning signage.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">This is a scandalous situation involving two State bodies, the NRA and the council, at loggerheads, trying to come up with some form of safety solution and unable to do so. I call on the Minister of State to give a satisfactory answer on why a solution cannot be found. It might save lives. There are many similar locations across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">We must consider the numbers of European drivers visiting Ireland, especially over the summer months. There are very few European road safety signs on our roads. We must be proactive. The many drivers who come here from France, Germany, Italy and other countries must be catered for, just as they cater for us in their countries. I ask the Minister of State to look into this as a matter of urgency.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_400">
            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_912">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue which unfortunately is not being sufficiently recognised and dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">The quick responses to terrible accidents which we have seen in some areas are not enough. There is a lack of Garda visibility on our roads. It is clear to anyone who travels the road that Garda presence is very hit and miss. We go through periods of great action as we did during the past two or three weeks. Several people have said that to me recently. We also go through long periods of inaction when Garda visibility is very poor.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">As far as I know, there is no law with regard to the visibility of pedestrians requiring them to wear a yellow jacket or arm-band for example. I would like the Minister of State to take the issue on board. If there is a law, I would like to see it implemented, and if not, legislation must be introduced. Pedestrians walking on unlit, dark, wet roads primarily place themselves at risk. This is a particular problem in rural areas where at any hour one can come across someone walking in the dark and invisible until the last moment. That is also a risk to the driver of a car and to other road users, as the driver will swerve if he or she sees someone only at the last minute. This needs to be dealt with and would not cost a fortune. It could have a very good outcome if we concentrated on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">Last year, the Minister for Transport missed an opportunity to do something about speed limits outside schools. The limits should be compulsorily reduced by way of national legislation rather than leaving it to individual local authorities. If there are cases to be made — though I believe they would be very few — outside particular schools for whatever reasons, a local authority might be allowed change the speed limit, but in general the limits should be reduced as a matter of urgency. Many schools have raised this issue with me. Local authorities sometimes do not even review the local speed limits once a year. They have to consult the Garda, give public notice, enter discussion and so on. It is a very slow process, and while it is ongoing children's lives are at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">Why has there been a delay in the penalty points enactment, with only four of the 69 areas earmarked for points enacted to date? As gardaí claim that they have difficulties with the system, the fault seems to lie on the other side of the House. Significant cultural changes are needed in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">While the absence of statistics on excessive consumption of alcohol by people killed in car accidents means that I must rely on anecdotal evidence to make my points, discussions with young people indicate that drink driving is taboo to the majority of them. However, I would like to know how many of the young people who died over the past few years had alcohol in their systems. Two issues that need to be addressed with regard to young people are speeding and drivers who over-estimate their abilities. A more visible Garda presence will cause people to behave differently out of fear of being caught.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">The delay in driver testing hinders the resolution of these problems. Significant delays are experienced at each of the three test centres located in my constituency. Almost 50% of those who take driving tests fail, which means they are not safe drivers. However, we allow them to return to the roads. Immediate reforms are needed to the system, including the regulation of driving instructors and, as was called for by Deputy Gay Mitchell, improvements in the structure of the driving test. Those failing the test need to learn their errors because it is nonsense to send them away without informing them why they failed. I ask the Minister of State to consider these issues.</p>

          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_401">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_919">It is timely, opportune and appropriate that we are discussing this motion and I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for bringing it forward. I hope that Members will forgive me for confining my remarks to the disturbing number of fatal accidents experienced recently in my county. Tragically, the people of County Donegal have become accustomed to waking up on Saturday and Sunday mornings to news reports of serious and often fatal accidents in different parts of the county involving young people in cars or pedestrians or cyclists.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">An examination of the past year will reveal a litany of terrible accidents. Most recently, 8 and 9 October was a black weekend for County Donegal, with the tragic deaths of five young people, most of whom were teenagers, on the Inishowen peninsula. Not long before that, on a Sunday afternoon in September, three people lost their lives in a road accident near Ballintra in the south of the county, of whom one was a close friend of mine.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">To date this year, 26 people in County Donegal have lost their lives in road accidents. In 2004, the figure was 30. With two months left of this year, there is no guarantee that we will not reach last year's disastrous levels. How can one explain that almost 10% of road fatalities in this country occur in County Donegal? Serious questions need to be answered as to why the level of road deaths is so high in a county which accounts for 3.5% of the total population. Every part of the county has been affected by this waste of young lives. Families and communities have been shocked and traumatised by the needless loss of lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">County Donegal's Border location is a contributing factor to the slaughter on its roads. Some reckless drivers from Northern Ireland cross the Border and indulge in speeding without fear of penalties for infringements of safety regulations and the same is probably true for those who go from the Republic to Northern Ireland. Harmonisation of policy on both sides of the Border is of critical importance. I concur with the comments made by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on this matter. A discrepancy exists between kilometres on this side and miles on the other and points given in Northern Ireland are not recorded in the South.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Gardaí in the county are doing their best with limited resources but they cannot counteract by themselves the culture of living dangerously which seems to have convinced many young people that they are invincible. The prevalence of mobile telephones means that young people have a sophisticated communications system at their disposal to avoid gardaí and engage in handbrake turns and doughnuts with virtual impunity. Gardaí need the support and help of the entire community. Public co-operation is crucial in ending the epidemic of road deaths in Donegal.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_402">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_924">Ireland has 2.2 million licensed drivers out of a population of 4 million. Approximately 350,000 of these drivers possess provisional licenses, which is one of the reasons for the high fatality rate on our roads. In 2003, 335 people were killed on Irish roads and the figure for this year is 380, as well as 3,000 injuries.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">I would like to refer to the issue of speed cameras and hope that the Minister of State will respond. The 100 private speed cameras which were promised in the 1998 road safety strategy did not materialise. These cameras were again promised in the road safety strategy for 2004 to 2004. The legislation needed to allow for the outsourcing of speed cameras to private operators has been promised for next year. Will the Minister of State indicate whether the necessary provisions will be introduced? By the time the legislation is enacted, two national road safety strategies will have passed without the complete roll-out of the 100 cameras promised in 1998. It has been demonstrated in the UK, France and Australia that speed cameras are effective in reducing road fatalities. They have been very successful in the state of Victoria in Australia.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">A motorcyclist is 17 times more likely to be killed in a road traffic accident than a car driver and one dies every week on Irish roads, yet the Government has not delivered on its promise to introduce compulsory basic training for motorcyclists. It is important to make young people aware of the risks of this activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">The numbers of motorists who are suspected of driving under the influence of drugs has increased by 30% in 2005 but no system is in place to deal with drug driving. Roadside equipment to test for drug driving is being piloted in the UK and I suggest that similar measures be adopted here as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">I concur with Deputy Gay Mitchell that a number of accidents, especially those occurring during daylight hours, are fatigue or stress related. People, particularly those travelling between Cork or Limerick and Dublin, drive under stressful conditions and do not get sufficient rest. The practice whereby people fall asleep at the wheels of their cars should be discouraged.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">Although the Minister for Transport has promised for some time that legislation would be introduced to ban the use of mobile telephones while driving, no measures have yet been brought. Legislation should be introduced as soon as possible to prevent accidents which occur because people cannot watch the road while using their mobile telephones, particularly when traffic is bumper to bumper.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The chairman of the National Safety Council, Mr. Eddie Shaw, has been critical of the Government on its failure to implement the national road safety strategy. Recently, he estimated that the number of annual road fatalities in this country should stand at 240, a figure which represents six deaths per 100,000 people. The numbers killed on our roads imply that 140 people are dying unnecessarily every year and 1,200 suffer serious injuries.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_931">I thank Members from all sides for their contributions to what has been an open and interesting debate on road safety. I am particularly encouraged by the acknowledgement of a number of speakers, in particular Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Shortall, that road safety is an area of public policy that should not be the subject of political point scoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">Deputy Shortall listed a range of issues referred to in the road safety strategy where she claims progress has not been made. As the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, pointed out in his contribution yesterday evening, progress has already been made across a range of key areas identified in the strategy. He also confirmed that the Government remains fully focused on the delivery of the overall range of initiatives that are scheduled for delivery within the planning horizon established for the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The issue of random breath testing was referred to in the contributions of many Members, including Deputies Olivia Mitchell, Shortall, Jim O'Keeffe and Coveney. Deputy Shortall also raised the question of the charge imposed following conviction for drink driving offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The first road safety strategy, which related to the period 1998 to 2002, indicated that while the Government would consider the possibility of some change to the position that prevailed in advance of the publication of that strategy, it did not envisage the adoption of the unqualified application of random breath testing by the end of the period in question. Subsequently, the Road Traffic Acts were amended to provide that the Garda Síochána may require that all drivers involved in road collisions or detected committing any traffic offences must submit to roadside breath tests. This is in addition to the power to demand that a driver who, in the opinion of a garda, has consumed alcohol must submit to such a test.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">The road safety strategy acknowledges that the absence of full random breath testing places unnecessary constraints on the Garda Síochána in its capacity to enforce drink-driving laws. The Government is pursuing the recommendation in the strategy by seeking to identify an approach that would be the most appropriate for this country. The Minister for Transport has offered to meet the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and the transport spokespersons of the political parties to discuss this issue so a formula that crosses political boundaries can be identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">The proposal in the road safety strategy to advance random breath testing represents one of a number of linked initiatives in the area of drink driving that will be pursued together. These include the introduction of an administrative disqualification as an alternative to a court appearance for certain drink driving offences, an increase in the disqualification periods which apply to drink driving and an increase in the charge imposed by the courts on those convicted of drink driving as a contribution towards the costs of the medical bureau of road safety in carrying out its analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">Deputies have referred to the question of motorcyclists on provisional licences being obliged to display L-plates. In line with the commitment given in the Road Safety Strategy 2004 — 2006, a requirement will be introduced that motorcyclists with a provisional licences display L-plates in common with other provisional licence holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">With regard to training of motorcyclists, the strategy states that it is the intention over the course of the relevant period to introduce compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists before they are permitted to drive alone on a public road. Primary legislation is necessary to facilitate the introduction of such training for motorcyclists and it is proposed to include the appropriate amendment on Committee Stage of the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004. As indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, last night, this Bill will be re-titled the Road Safety Authority Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The registration of driving and motorcycle instructors will involve a test of the competence of individual instructors. Responsibility for the implementation of a system of registration will rest with the new road safety authority, as will responsibility for overseeing the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists. A prerequisite for the introduction of such training will be a registration system for motorcycle instructors who will deliver such training.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Coveney referred to the area of drugs and driving. The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda Síochána may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample, which will then be subject to analysis by the medical bureau of road safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Currently, there is no feasible basis for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs. However, screening devices based on oral fluid specimens are being developed for the purpose of carrying out roadside drug testing. Such testing devices are in prototype stages and the medical bureau of road safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_947">The strange thing about road safety, unlike other issues, is that there are definite, clear and obvious ways of preventing what is happening from happening. They have been obvious for many years. The issue for Fianna Fáil is that it is getting nervous about taking people off the roads <i>en masse</i>. It got very nervous around local election time. It was clear that the penalty points system worked. It was clear from information from the Garda Síochána that it slowed people down. However, because the Government did not introduce any more than four out of a possible 69 categories of offences liable for penalty points, the system lost its impetus entirely. It is clear that Fianna Fáil is unpopular and it is also clear that as it goes into a general election 18 months from now, the last thing it wants to do is upset large numbers of people by taking them off the road. It is simply about politics. Fianna Fáil understands local politics better than most and understands what I have said to be true.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">I disagree with some Members who spoke this evening. While it is true that increased visibility of gardaí provides a deterrent, it is not the only solution. The issue is about driver behaviour, taking a real crack at that issue and taking the necessary steps and Fianna Fáil has proven completely incapable and unwilling to take such steps time and again. This is epitomised by Mr. Eddie Shaw of the National Safety Council who said that 144 people could have been saved if the Government had taken those steps. It is obvious what those steps were. They were clear, determinate and definite but the Government has made no effort to take them over the last two or three years. All we hear is excuse after excuse. Whether it be mobile telephones or driver training, the Government has taken no concrete steps to address road safety issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">The issue is whether Fianna Fáil is prepared to lose additional votes by implementing measures that may be very unpopular with the public. It is not prepared to do so. That is obvious.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">I began my political career as a councillor in 1999 and one of the first issues I raised with the county council concerned a stretch of road, approximately four miles long. It was obvious that many people were being killed on this stretch of road. In one particular black spot, approximately 20 people had been killed over a period of 20 years, an average of one per year. Eventually, I managed to get a 60 km/h speed limit imposed. Nobody ever questioned my figures, contradicted me or said I was exaggerating or wrong. The problem was that we were reliant on the Garda for information on all of the crashes, and many minor crashes that took place on that stretch of road over 20 years were never recorded.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">We have not invested in the kind of research that is needed when it comes to crashes. In many cases we do not know exactly why they are occurring. We are reliant on information from the Garda Síochána, which in many cases is not sufficient to draw up a clear picture as to what should be done, what solutions might be effective, how dangerous a particular stretch of road might be or what can be done to minimise the danger. We will not improve overall safety on the roads unless we are prepared to make an investment in that kind of scientific analysis of what causes crashes. That is the case in regard to the first point I made, about which I feel strongly. I do not believe the Minister of State is honest, forthright or realistic about dealing with the issue because he knows it will cost the Government votes in the next election if people are taken off the road <i>en masse</i>.</p>

          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_409">
            <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_952">Last night, I highlighted the inadequacy of virtually every aspect of our traffic laws, whether the administration, legislation or enforcement. It is a long and sorry tale of either incompetence or indifference. I detected from the Government benches almost an acceptance that what we said was true. No one can stand over the current road death toll which is going in the opposite direction to every country in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">Tonight I want to be a little more positive when speaking about what the Government should do and what it should stop doing. I said last night that we must change the whole culture surrounding driving. To do so, we must change driver behaviour, which means better education, regulation and enforcement. There must be better driver education at all stages of life. People need education before going near the road, and long after they have passed the test they need ongoing education. We need an improved modern and reformed driving test, a test that must be passed at some point. We need an environment that encourages good driving and punishes those who offend and endanger their own lives and the lives of others. We must do something about mandatory training courses for instructors, together with a statutory register of instructors. At the moment, one does not even have to have passed a driving test to set oneself up as a driving instructor. It is essential that people have a minimum number of lessons before going on the road.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">There must be a change in the status of the provisional licence. It must be a provisional licence which leads to something; there is no point calling it a provisional licence if it leads nowhere. It is unacceptable to have a provisional licence for life. There should be a maximum number of penalty points for people on provisional licences so that there is some incentive to pass the test and learn how to drive properly. There should be a requirement for zero blood alcohol. The motorway ban should be strictly enforced. There should be an after-dark ban so that there is a real incentive to learn to drive and pass the test.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">Members spoke about the need for training for motorcyclists before they go near a motorcycle. No level of road deaths is acceptable but, as far as motorcyclists are concerned, the number is way off the scale. Motorcyclists comprise 2% of drivers and they account for 25% of road deaths, which is unacceptable. We were promised that this issue would be dealt with but nothing has happened. There should be an accident investigation unit to find out what is causing all these accidents. We say broadly that it is driver behaviour, but which behaviour? It is a nonsense not to have statistics in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">As my colleague, Deputy Enright, said, no toxicology test is carried out if one dies. It is at the discretion of the coroner but, in most cases, the cause of the accident is not known. If someone is to be charged, blood tests and so on are taken but there is no comprehensive information on what causes accidents. We guess that alcohol is the cause of 40% of deaths, but we do not know.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The NRA is the body responsible for publishing and collating the figures relating to the causes of accidents. It states that road conditions are the cause of approximately 2.5% of accidents, which I do not believe. It may be that that refers to national roads only but, in any event, no agency should adjudicate on itself. As it is responsible for the upkeep of roads, it should not be involved in such a task. We need an independent agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The gardaí must be upskilled. Approximately eight of the 12,000 gardaí have the forensic training to investigate causes of high speed crashes. No matter how many laws and regulations are introduced, if there is no enforcement, it is a complete waste of time. I said last night that fear works, and Irish drivers perceive they have nothing to fear. Until we enforce the law, we are just wasting our time.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">In Victoria, Australia, there was a high incidence of road traffic accidents and a very high number of deaths. Four or five years ago, the authorities introduced a rigorous road safety campaign, which has worked. They believe that compliance measures have been the cornerstone in reducing fatalities. They are the key contributor to the substantial number of lives that are saved in Victoria each year. It would be great if we could say the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">What is missing is not the Government's awareness of the problem, every area of policy is in a complete unmitigated shambles. I do not think anyone can deny it. It is entirely due to a lack of political leadership and a lack of a concentrated concerted effort to deal with the barriers to road safety. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, who is abroad is like a gadfly. He alights momentarily on every problem and then flits off to something else. He has not grasped the problem to ensure success in this area. One must do more than just turn up for the photo shoot. He espouses one cause after another if a photo shoot is involved. He espouses it for half a day or a few hours, with no apparent preplanning and no attention to detail. It is no wonder every initiative is floundering on the rocks of inattention to detail and failure to plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">We were promised outsourced driver testing to clear the backlog. A number of people went to the trouble of tendering for the work and someone was awarded it. However, because there was no preplanning or prior consultation, it has now ended up in the Labour Court. Outsourcing never happened and no one took responsibility for it. We were promised outsourcing of the national roll-out of speed cameras. Then it was discovered that legislation was required, but it was not introduced and no one took responsibility for it. We were promised an automatic seamless penalty points administration system, but it was discovered that the computer system could not cope with it. A large number of gardaí did not even have access to a computer, therefore, nothing happened and no one took responsibility. We decided on an outsourced payments system for the penalty points system. I have been hearing about this for months, but nothing has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">The driver testing and standards authority was promised, which would solve all the problems. The legislation was published, we all spoke about it and then it was withdrawn mysteriously. Nothing has happened and no one has taken responsibility for it. We were promised random testing, which gardaí say is crucial to improving the conviction rate. It is also crucial as a deterrent. At least if there was the threat of it, it would work as a deterrent. That has been abandoned on legal advice and no attempt was made to find a solution, despite the fact that the conviction rate continues to drop. Nothing has happened and no one has taken responsibility. However, I am delighted to hear tonight that we are to have a meeting about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The previous Minister promised legislation to ban mobile phones while driving, but that was dropped on legal advice because he could not define a mobile phone. Nothing happened and no one took responsibility. These are just a few instances in a long litany of disasters which can only be due either to gross incompetence or a lack of political will and political leadership on the part of the Minister. I believe it is the latter because I do not think he is that incompetent. He must stop being a hands-off Minister, so to speak. He must stop being the ten-year, one-page Minister. He must stop being the kind of Minister who said he did not give Dublin Bus any buses because it did not ask. When a matter is too complex to deal with, he must stop thinking that setting up new bodies and outsourcing are a solution or an alternative to applying himself to detailed planning and getting the matter off his desk.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">Once and for all he must achieve what he set out to achieve rather than try to find a legislative solution that gets the problem off his desk. The solution is for the Minister to be a Minister. The Minister with responsibility must take responsibility. It is not rocket science but if one person does not take responsibility for driving forward and delivering all these measures, and we accept they must be brought forward, legislated for and enforced, people will continue to die needlessly. The only person who can do it is the Minister. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_410">
            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_1081">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter this evening. My purpose in doing so is to establish the situation regarding lands in the ownership of the HSE in Tuam, Portumna and Ballinasloe, County Galway. The lands in Tuam were purchased more than three years ago by the old Western Health Board at the behest of the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for the construction of a 60-bed community hospital with x-ray facilities, a primary care unit, an ambulance base and other ancillary medical facilities. Although a planning brief was submitted to the Minister in 2002, nothing has happened on the project since then, despite a firm undertaking given in 2002 by no less a person than the Taoiseach. This commitment was given on his own behalf and on behalf of the then Minister, Deputy Martin, the local Fianna Fáil public representatives and the local Fianna Fáil organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">It now appears that the lands which were purchased for the construction of a community hospital are being assessed to establish how many housing units could be built there under the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. What is the status of this latest madcap idea for the site? Is the proposal to build houses here serious? If so, the community hospital for Tuam is dead. What are the Government's plans for those lands? Is the Government about to sell the lands?</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">A specific project is proposed for the HSE lands in Portumna, which requires the full amount of those lands in order to be viable. South East Galway Integrated Rural Development Limited, in association with South East Galway Housing Association working in conjunction with Galway County Council, the Heritage Council, Galway Rural Development, Galway County Association for the Mentally Handicapped, east Galway mental health services and others, have formulated a €24 million project for those lands which involves the restoration of old workhouse buildings and the construction of social and private housing. Plans for the project were greatly advanced even to the extent of agreement having been reached to transfer ownership from the HSE to South East Galway IRD and South East Galway Housing Association. It appears that consideration is being given to utilising two acres of those lands under the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">If the sale of those lands proceeds it will render this community project unviable and will leave the old buildings as a blot on the Portumna landscape for the foreseeable future. What are the plans for the Portumna HSE lands? Will part of the lands be sold or will the lands in their entirety be transferred to the South East Galway IRD and South East Galway Housing Association so that they can proceed with the valuable work in which they are engaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">The issue regarding the lands in Ballinasloe may not be as critical as with the lands in Tuam and Portumna as no specific project is planned for those lands requiring the use of all the lands under the control of the HSE. However, the western region of the HSE has a requirement for land in Ballinasloe. That requirement needs to be comprehensively established before further consideration is given to the sale of any of the Ballinasloe lands. If after a full appraisal of the needs it is found that some of the Ballinasloe lands are surplus to requirements, consideration should be given to selling part of the land, provided the proceeds are reinvested in Ballinasloe. What is going on with regard to the lands in Tuam, Portumna and Ballinasloe? Is it the case that one arm of the State does not know what the other is planning or is the Tuam health campus project being abandoned, the Portumna community project being torpedoed and the future of health projects in Ballinasloe being put in jeopardy? Is it the case that the Galway lands are being used to fund inner city Dublin social housing?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1086">I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to provide the House with an update on the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">While considerable progress has been made in recent years in increasing overall housing supply, the demand for housing remains high, particularly in major urban areas. Against this background, the parties to the pay agreement, Sustaining Progress, proposed a new initiative aimed at further enhancing the supply of affordable housing, with the objective of significantly increasing the supply of such houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The Government is therefore strongly committed to the ambition of delivering the affordable housing initiative and other arrangements under the Planning and Development Acts. It is envisaged that housing provided under the initiative will be aimed at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but who find that they are unable to do so in the current housing market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">With regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, the Health Service Executive western area has been advised of the Government decision to release State lands in the health sector for affordable housing under Sustaining Progress. The executive has identified a number of sites for consideration for inclusion in this initiative. It is engaged in a process of reviewing the implications of the initiative on these sites for planned health services development. This review will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">I understand that the executive will communicate its views shortly to the parties concerned, including the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is not intended that the affordable housing initiative would have a negative impact on planned developments in the health sector. The Health Service Executive will strive at all times to strike a balance with regard to individual proposals to satisfy in the most realistic way possible both its own objectives and those of the initiative.</p>

          <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_412">
            <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
            <p eId="para_1091">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, and hope he will have a favourable reply for me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">Will the Minister of State explain to me and the people of County Kerry the reason the number of home help hours in County Kerry has been reduced by more than 100,000 in the space of just two years? Figures the Labour Party recently obtained from the Department of Health and Children show that in 2002 there were 789,011 hours of home help provided to people in County Kerry. In 2004, that figure dropped to just 683,296, a drop of 105,715 hours in two years. Does the Minister of State realise the enormous value of 105,000 hours of home help to people in County Kerry? Home help is probably the most valuable social health service available to an elderly, infirm or housebound person who wants to remain at home with dignity but needs a little care and assistance, usually daily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">We have heard much from the Minister for Health and Children about her desire to see the elderly and the incapacitated cared for at home and kept out of long-stay institutions where possible. The Minister and the Government have emphasised the need for greater investment in home care to enable people to live at home with dignity and to free up long-stay institution places and hospital beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">I have often spoken in this House about the lack of funding for the Cúram home care grant for people in County Kerry. Successful applicants are being denied the grant because funding has expired. The cases and figures I am putting on the record of the House give the lie to the Government commitment of investment in home-based care. How can the Government say it is investing in home care when it has cut by more than 100,000 the number of hours of home help provided in County Kerry over the past two years?</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Let me explain to the Minister of State the reality locally of these kinds of cutbacks. I spoke to a constituent of mine recently whose home help told her that she could not stay and chat any more as she had only so many hours to do her chores for the woman concerned. She had to get in and out of the house as quickly as possible because of her set quota of home help hours. This elderly woman was also told by her home help that she would wash her clothes, but not those of her husband because he was not the person in receipt of home help. The home help sorted the man's from the woman's clothes. What kind of society is it where this happens? Is the Government willing to stand over that kind of a system?</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">One of the most important roles of the home help service is to provide a level of social interaction to the client who may often not see another human being from one end of the week to the other. Now it seems that thanks to the cutbacks, home helps are only in a position to do the basic household chores and are gone out the door shortly after they arrive. I have heard the Minister for Health and Children persistently deny that the Government is cutting back on home help and insist it is investing more money. It is true there may be more investment but it goes mainly towards increased wages for home helps, and rightly so. However, thousands of people are losing out on the hours of home help they receive because of cutbacks in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">I appeal to the Minister to stop cutting back on what is arguably the best and most valuable social health service available to people who are living at home but not in a position to do some of their household chores. I ask her to give a commitment to the House that the hours lost, particularly in County Kerry, will be restored.</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">As the Deputy will be aware, the policy of the Department of Health and Children on the development and delivery of services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies. It aims to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent and to encourage and support the care of older people in their community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies. The role of the home help service is vital to the implementation of this policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">Following the publication in 1998 of the report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I am pleased to say that there has been a major step forward in the implementation of the home help scheme from 1999 onwards with the service being provided to an increasing number of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">The aim of the home help service is to enable people to remain at home, where appropriate, who would otherwise need to be cared for in residential care. It is recognised that the service is an essential support to family and informal carers. The HSE southern area has advised that the total number of home help hours provided in Kerry in recent years is as follows. In 2002 some 789,011 hours were provided. In 2003, the hours provided came to 701,216. In 2004, some 683,296 hours were provided and the projected hours for 2005 come to 720,000 hours.</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_1103">It is understood that the home help hours figure for 2001 was similar to that of 2003. However, the total number of home help hours provided in 2002 included once-off hours, arising from the national home help agreement 2000, for annual leave and training and other elements of the service relating to the agreement. Therefore, the 2002 figures reflect both the core service hours for that year and the additional once-off arrears relating to previous years. There have been significant increases in the investment in the home help service since 2002. Some €95.7 million was spent on the service in that year and it is estimated that €120 million will be spent this year. That represents an increase of 25%. As the home help service is a flexible service that responds to clients' needs, the level of service required in individual cases fluctuates from time to time. The service is targeted at high and medium dependency clients, in accordance with their assessed needs, to ensure that an effective prioritisation of the service assessments is undertaken at local level and carried out in all cases by the HSE's public health nursing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">I am aware that Deputy Moynihan-Cronin has taken a particular interest in this matter. I agree that the home help service has been a wonderful success and has brought great benefits to those who are targeted by it. Those involved in the service appreciate what is being done. The jobs that are done might be quite small in some cases, but small things make a great difference to the quality of life of the people who receive them. As I have explained, the Government has increased its investment in the home help service. All the studies show that people are much happier in their own homes. The home help service allows many men and women to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. It becomes impossible for them to stay in their homes in some cases, unfortunately, and they have to move on to long-term care. Our experience has taught us that the home help service works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The Government will continue to support and expand the scheme, which offers exceptionally good value for money. Not only does the service benefit older people and carers, but it also solves a number of problems in our hospitals, for example by freeing up beds. The Government appreciates the participation of so many people in the scheme, which is working well. It intends to continue to develop the scheme by investing more money in it.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_417">
            <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_1106">I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to raise this important issue. Cardiac Self-Help Wicklow is a voluntary group that was established in the autumn of 2003 with a view to making defibrillators available in the wider community. Several thousand people die in Ireland from sudden cardiac arrest each year. The many causes of sudden cardiac arrest include genetic propensity, illness, heart attack, environmental conditions and physical contact. A hard blow to the chest can knock a person, even a fit young athlete, into cardiac arrest. Dehydration or heat exertion can also bring on sudden cardiac arrest. A person of any age can be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">As a result of the ambulance service's work with voluntary groups in County Wicklow, the first responders scheme is in operation in 14 parts of the county. Under the scheme, trained local volunteers assist the ambulance service when a person in the locality suffers or is threatened with cardiac arrest. A further eight communities are in the process of getting involved in the scheme. Cardiac Self-Help Wicklow intends to extend the first responders scheme to all parts of the county, with the co-operation of local communities. Under the targeted defibrillation programme, local groups can privately purchase a defibrillator and make it available in their immediate areas. Shopping centres, airports, schools and sporting clubs have defibrillators on site and have trained people to use them. Local community groups have been called into service more than 40 times since the scheme became operational in County Wicklow in the spring of this year. The scheme, which is extremely successful, provides assistance and assurance, particularly in isolated areas. The success of the first responders scheme in County Wicklow is due in no small part to the progressive involvement of the ambulance service in the HSE region that succeeded the former ERHA area. Other HSE areas are reluctant to get involved, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">I am aware that a Government task force, chaired by Dr. Brian Maurer, will report soon on the issue of sudden cardiac death. I am confident that he will strongly recommend the national roll-out of a first responders scheme like that in operation in County Wicklow. While the resources needed to establish and maintain such a scheme are minimal for the return, human resources need to be specifically allocated to the project. The Garda, fire service and other statutory bodies can also play a role. Planning guidelines need to be amended to provide for the inclusion of defibrillators in commercial developments. The Department of Education and Science has a role to play in including cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the school curriculum. Legislation is necessary to deal with the concerns of volunteers who have a fear of litigation and to assist with the concept of targeted defibrillation. Fine Gael has placed such legislation, the Good Samaritan Bill 2005, on the Dáil Order Paper. The Minister for Health and Children has repeatedly called for ideas from this side of the House. I have been pushing this idea, the implementation of which would greatly improve the health service at a nominal cost, for over two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">I know there is resistance to the first responders scheme among general practitioners and others involved in the medical profession, who have concerns about handing a piece of medical equipment to people in the community who might not be well trained in its use. The scheme, which has been very successful in County Wicklow to date, has worked beyond our wildest dreams because local people have given a tremendous level of commitment to it. My colleague, Deputy Lowry, raised on the Adjournment some time ago the issue of targeted defibrillations. I am aware that the editor of the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> has written a very condescending and ill-informed article on the issue. I invite him and anyone else involved in the medical profession who has doubts about the matter to travel to County Wicklow to see how the scheme is operated there by volunteers who have been trained by the ambulance service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">The scheme is validated every 90 days by the ambulance service. If a person in the parts of County Wicklow in which the scheme is in operation dials 999, or whatever the relevant number is, not only will an ambulance come from Naas, Wicklow or Baltinglass, but the local scheme volunteer will also be contacted by mobile telephone so that he or she can get to the scene of the difficulty. It is a very successful scheme. When Dr. Maurer's report has been published, I hope the Minister for Health and Children will initiate a proactive and progressive campaign to bring the scheme into operation throughout the country.</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_1111">I thank Deputy Timmins for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the House some details of the work being done to improve how cardiac emergencies are dealt with. As the Deputy said, Deputy Lowry raised a similar matter in the House some months ago. I would like to update the House on the developments since then. The Health Act 2004 provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive on 1 January last. Under the Act, the HSE is responsible for managing and delivering, or arranging to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. As part of the reform of the health service, a national ambulance office has been established, under the auspices of the national hospitals office within the HSE, with responsibility for the provision of pre-hospital emergency care, including the development of the first responder service where required. The 2001 report of the strategic review of the ambulance service has largely formed the basis for the development of pre-hospital emergency medical services in recent years. The report recommended that all ambulance services should consider establishing first responder programmes to support the ambulance service. In line with that recommendation, the eastern region of the HSE trained more than 1,000 people last year in cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the community. The Department of Health and Children has been advised that a number of community first responder schemes are in operation throughout the country. The HSE has advised that the further roll-out of such schemes will take place subject to the pre-hospital care needs of particular regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">Deputy Timmins is aware that a national task force on sudden cardiac death was established in September 2004 to address the problem of sudden cardiac death. The task force, which is chaired by Dr. Brian Maurer, has almost completed its work. It will make recommendations on the prevention of sudden cardiac death and the detection of those at high risk. The task force will advise on equipment and training programmes, to improve the outcomes in the cases of those suffering from sudden cardiac collapse, and on the establishment of appropriate surveillance systems. In particular, the task force will advise on maximising access to basic life support and automatic external defibrillators, appropriate levels of training in basic life support and the use of automatic external defibrillators and the maintenance of that training. It will also consider who should be deemed to be priority individuals and priority groups for such training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The task force will make decisions on the geographic areas and functional locations of greatest need, the best practice models of first responder schemes and public access defibrillation and the integration of such training services. I understand that the task force has been involved in widespread consultation with individuals and organisations and that a report will be published shortly. I thank Deputy Timmins for his contribution. It was heartening to hear his report on the success of the first responder scheme in County Wicklow. The task force's recommendations will inform future policy in this area. Funding will be provided through the HSE to support the implementation of the recommendations.</p>

          <heading>Third Level Fees.</heading>
          <speech by="#CeciliaKeaveney" eId="spk_419">
            <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
            <p eId="para_1114">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this issue which is of importance to the students of Donegal and all the Border counties, in particular, as well as the rest of the country. Third level fees were introduced in the North of Ireland a few years ago and a change to the fee structure is being planned for September 2006 whereby top-up fees will be charged to students. It would appear that while in the past the tab for students from the Republic was collected by education boards, this will no longer be the case and, therefore, fees will be applicable to Irish students attending Northern universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">I declare an interest in that I attended university in Jordanstown just outside Belfast for seven years. I know how important and useful it is to be able to access many different universities when filling in UCCA forms and other third level college application forms at leaving certificate stage. In the context of the Good Friday Agreement we are supposed to be advocating all-Ireland policies and the integration of the Thirty-two Counties in terms of access to education, health, retail therapy and so on. It is important that the Minister for Education and Science would intervene in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">I was annoyed on looking through the manifestoes and policy papers of Northern Ireland parties because, as a member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, the issue of top-up fees and access to Northern colleges would probably not arise if the Northern Executive were up and running. One of the parties stated that fees exacerbate inequalities in access and that the decline in the number of students from low income, rural, isolated and marginal communities was unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">Another party, coming from a different background, stated that fees act as a deterrent to potential university students from disadvantaged backgrounds and that Queen's University and the University of Ulster had worked hard to be open to all. One party referred to the intention of Queen's University and the University of Ulster to apply a maximum of £3,000 per year from 2006 and that this would lead to severe hardship for students. However, another party stated that the amount of £3,000 per year would only be an introductory amount that would inevitably rise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">A further argument propounded by one party was that top-up fees would damage the health service because people from working class backgrounds would not be attracted to the health professions because of the cost. A party from a completely different background stated that students could opt for cheaper courses regardless of the value they add to their education because subjects like science, engineering and professions such as law and medicine would be more expensive and thus people would not apply for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">Coming from Donegal, I would like to think that the people with all these views on education would make their own decisions. I would love to see the Executive up and running so that these decisions could be made. Unfortunately, as the Executive is not up and running, students from the Republic could face fees that did not exist previously. This will be to the detriment of students wishing to attend the University of Ulster at Jordanstown, Coleraine or Magee or Queen's University. We have enough anomalies in the system with the recognition of courses and NVQs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">We are supposed to encourage people into education to give them foundations. We keep on using the mantra that a better educated population is a better equipped one in terms of society and the big, bad world, yet we appear to be in a negative free-fall since the Good Friday Agreement in that, in the past, people like me from the Republic were free to go to Northern universities and their fees were dealt with but students in future will be charged. The argument in the North is that everybody is getting charged so everybody is being treated equally, but I am getting representations from people who want to avail of Northern universities and from families that have more than one child who wishes to access university. The prospect of such fees is bad enough for one child but would be extremely difficult for families with a number of children wishing to go to university.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">Given that the Executive is not in operation, it is important that the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, would pass on my request to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to raise this issue as a matter of urgency with her counterpart in Northern Ireland rather than wait for people to complain this time next year about fees or that nobody went to the Northern universities.</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_1122">I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I will reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who is unavoidably absent owing to a prior commitment. The free fees initiative scheme operated by the Department of Education and Science provides free tuition to eligible students who attend approved third level courses. The main eligibility conditions of the initiative are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. The courses approved for free tuition are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years' duration which are followed in approved third level institutions in the State. At present, in the region of 40 institutions deliver courses approved for free tuition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">There are no plans by the Department of Education and Science to extend the eligibility conditions of the free fees initiative to cover students attending third level institutions in Northern Ireland. Under the terms of the Department's maintenance grants schemes, grant assistance is available to eligible students attending approved third level courses in approved institutions. An approved course for the purpose of the schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution. To qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must satisfy the prescribed conditions of the schemes, including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Students from this State who attend undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of the Department's higher education grant scheme and vocational education committees' scholarship scheme. Both these schemes provide that where a candidate is not eligible for free tuition under the free fees initiative and is pursuing an approved course at undergraduate level in an institution listed in the State, the local authority or vocational education committee may award a full or part grant in respect of the candidate's lecture fee, subject to the terms of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">There are no plans to extend the payment of tuition fees under the student support schemes to undergraduate students attending approved courses outside the State. It is understood, however, that students attending higher education institutions in Northern Ireland and who are ordinarily resident in a member state of the European Union will be eligible for a fee loan from the Northern Ireland authorities up to the amount charged by the higher education institution. Further clarification is available from the Department of Employment and Learningin Northern Ireland. Its e-mail address is <i>studentfinance@delni.gov.uk</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 also provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states. I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this matter in the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1134">The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, it controls and manages the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement the fund's investment strategy. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term subject to prudent risk management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">The independence of the commission is a cornerstone of the legislation which ensures that the commission will invest in a manner that maximises returns. Essentially, it is similar to the trustee arrangements that apply to private pension funds and places an obligation on the Commission to act commercially and in the best interests of the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">With regard to commercial investment in public sector projects in this country, the Annual Report of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission for 2004 states that the commission has made an initial allocation of €200 million for investment in public private partnerships in Ireland and will increase this allocation should suitable opportunities arise. I also understand that, to date, no moneys have been invested by the commission in any such projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_1142">The Government Supplies Agency, as part of its procurement responsibilities, has placed contracts for several years with Bord Gáis Éireann for the supply of natural gas to a large number of state sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">As with all procurement, the agency seeks to achieve the most economically advantageous terms available for its end users. Prior to 2003 this involved negotiating a price for the supply of natural gas with the single supplier, Bord Gáis Éireann. Following deregulation, there was scope for competition in relation to the unit price of gas, and the GSA initiated a process of competitive pricing for the unit cost, which is still in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">With regard to transmission costs the Deputy will be aware that gas has to be transported from either Inch, County Cork, or Moffat in Scotland to each site in the country. This transmission or transportation mechanism is operated by Bord Gáis Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The Commission for Energy Regulation, on 29 July 2005, invited observations from the public and interested parties on its proposed decision regarding transmission or transportation tariffs for the 2005-06 gas year. The Government Supplies Agency, in response to that invitation, submitted its views to the Commission on 25 August 2005. The agency's observations, which related to transmission costs only, were offered as part of an ongoing dialogue on the provision of energy supplies between the agency, acting on behalf of its customers, and the commission. The agency acknowledges and accepts that the commission will take a wider range of considerations into account when reaching its decisions. The agency did not receive from the commission any direct feedback on its letter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1149">I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy and of concerns expressed in relation to the continued growth in credit, particularly to the household sector, and the possible effects of increasing indebtedness upon borrowers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">The Deputies may wish to note that the growth of credit and the associated increase in indebtedness are in the first instance a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, taking into account its role as a part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">While the report referred to highlights the increasing indebtedness of Irish households, it also highlights the fact that the sustainability of household debt is supported by strong demographics, low interest rates and a high savings ratio. This view is generally supported by the findings of the recently published Financial Stability Report from the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority. A key finding of the bank's report is that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels. The Central Bank's report does, however, highlight the continuation of strong mortgage credit growth as an important risk factor. It, therefore, emphasises the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders, to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">The Deputies may also wish to note that in the current environment of historically low interest rates, the level of private sector credit has been increasing strongly in a number of countries, including Ireland, and also other eurozone countries. In our case this is occurring in a context of strong economic growth and increasing employment. I reiterate the importance of borrowers acting sensibly and taking into account the prospect that interest rates will be higher in the medium term. I fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the financial regulator on the issue of personal credit and mortgage debt, and in reminding the lending institutions of the need for prudence on their part.</p>

            <p eId="para_1154">Public procurement of computer systems operates within a policy defined by European and domestic procurement law. Up to date guidelines for public procurement, including information technology solutions, were issued to Government Departments and offices by my Department in 2004. I am satisfied that the procurement systems in place are robust and as a general rule operate in a satisfactory manner. They are kept underreview.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">The specification, design and implementation of computer-IT systems can be quite complex and challenging. There are many examples of good implementations of such systems throughout the public service, for example, the Revenue on-line service and the motor tax on-line system etc. However, there are also, unfortunately, a small number of examples where projects have run into difficulties for a variety of reasons. Delays can occur because of a change in requirements or scope or because something arose that was not foreseen. Sometimes, unfortunately, expenditure overruns arise from poor planning and poor decision-making in an individual organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">My Department continually keeps this matter under review. Due to the increasing size and complexity of ICT projects now being undertaken in the Civil Service, it was felt that the delegation arrangements had to be strengthened, particularly for large ICT projects. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently decided that peer reviews should be immediately put in place for large ICT projects. It is intended that progress will be made before the end of 2005 in relation to having peer reviews carried out on some large scale projects. This will bring to bear the experiences of senior computer managers across the Civil Service to evaluate the viability of project proposals, to determine the best implementation method and to review progress at critical stages. Peer reviews will not override in any way the accountability arrangements in place within organisations. It is worth noting that forms of peer review are also being implemented in other administrations to deal with size and complexity issues in ICT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">The peer review process will particularly focus on: the preparation of good business cases, affordability, procurement, detailed planning, strong governance arrangements and on limiting the scope of a proposed project to the current ICT capacity of the sponsoring organisation. The Deputy will be aware of a recent Government decision which significantly strengthens controls in the area of project management and the peer review process will check that these new controls have been taken fully into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1159">As a small, open economy, Ireland is heavily reliant on the international economy and external shocks have the potential to significantly reduce Irish growth. In this regard, my Department is constantly monitoring developments in the world economy. For example, in the Economic Review and Outlook, published August 2005, my Department identified a number of external risks to the economic outlook going forward, including: the high level of oil prices; the possibility of a sharp dollar correction leading to an appreciation in the value of the euro; and lower growth in the euro zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">My Department, in partnership with ERSI, makes use of the institute's model HERMES. Using this model it is possible to simulate the impact of external shocks on the domestic economy, for example, oil price hikes and exchange rate movements. For example, in chapter 4 of the Stability Programme Update, published with the budget, my Department publishes a sensitivity update, which examines the impact of interest rate changes and growth surprises on the general Government balance, using the HERMES model.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">However, it should be recognised the model-based analyses are subject to a number of limitations. Simulations rely on extrapolation from past trends in indicators such as growth, inflation, employment etc. Substantial structural change has taken place in the economy in recent years which may make the results of any simulation less accurate.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1163">The issue of making unused tax credits refundable was examined by a working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare system. The group was made up of representatives of the social partners and was chaired by my Department. Among other things, it examined the issues which might arise if personal tax credits including the basic personal tax credit, the employee PAYE tax credit, the one-parent family tax credit, the home carer tax credit, the incapacitated child tax credit, the blind person's tax credit, the dependant relative tax credit and the widowed person tax credit were made refundable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent estimated cost of making the main personal tax credits refundable when they are unused is broadly in the region of €1.8 billion annually. The main category of refund would relate to the basic personal credit — single, married and widowed — where the annual cost of refunding the unused portion of the credit to income earners with insufficient income to fully absorb it would amount to €900 million approximately. The next categories of refund in order of scale would be the employee credit —€840 million approximately — and the homecarer credit —€32 million approximately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">The estimate of €1.8 billion relates only to the cost of extending refundable tax credits to all those on Revenue's tax files. If a refundable tax credit system were to be introduced, one would have to consider those who are not on the tax files, for example, those who are of employable age but not working, including those in social welfare. This would increase the cost hugely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">I assume that what the Deputy has in mind in his question is whether the provision of income support by means of refundable tax credits in the tax system would be more equitable and efficient than the present approach where it is provided through the social welfare system. That would depend on the nature of the arrangements put in place. However, on the question of equity, a refundable tax credits system would not necessarily mean that all would benefit equally from budget day tax changes. If rates of income tax are reduced or increased in a budget, only those paying tax benefit lose whereas the situation for those outside the tax net remains unchanged. In addition, such a system would not necessarily be more efficient. It could not operate on an automatic basis and potential beneficiaries, especially those outside the tax system, would be required to contact the Revenue Commissioners to secure their entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">It should also be noted that a system of refundable tax credits could bring with it possible downside effects. A refundable tax credits system would have the characteristics of a partial basic income system. Such a system could impact adversely on enterprise and effort in the economy. A possible disincentive to work and adverse implications for competitiveness and output of the economy may also be among the main disadvantages. The system would also be very complicated to administer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1169">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are conducting their investigation into the use by taxpayers of life assurance investment products for the purposes of tax evasion in two stages. In the first stage of these inquiries taxpayers, who invested undisclosed and undeclared funds in life assurance products were given until 23 May 2005 to advise Revenue of this. This part of the disclosure stage has now been successfully completed and about 10,000 notices of intention to make a disclosure were received from taxpayers or their agents and a total of €374 million has been paid in tax, interest and penalties by approximately 5,000 individuals. Some of the notices received by 23 May were protective. Correspondence was received from others indicating that no liabilities arose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">Revenue formally commenced the second stage of its investigation into the use of life assurance products for tax evasion on 23 May 2005. New powers were provided in the Finance Act 2005 to authorise Revenue officers to examine the records that relate to a class or classes of life assurance policies and policyholders in the course of conducting sampling exercises. Revenue has completed the preliminary work regarding the use of these new powers and authorised officers are actively engaged in the sampling process. The information gathered in this process and from the voluntary disclosures will be used to ground applications to the High Court for orders directing insurance companies to furnish details on policyholders and policies to Revenue. It is envisaged that the initial applications will be made in late 2005 or early 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1172">A 20% tax credit applies to companies that incur incremental expenditure on research and development, R&amp;D. An incremental tax credit is preferable to a volume based credit in that it lessens the dead-weight expenditure qualifying for the credit and encourages increases in R&amp;D expenditure, which is the policy aim behind the incentive. The definition of R&amp;D is based on best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">The credit also helps to enhance our competitiveness as a location for new internationally mobile research-related investment, and will encourage existing overseas and indigenous firms to add research functions to their operations in Ireland or to increase their level of research activity.

            <p eId="para_1174">The credit was introduced in 2004 and it is too early for a detailed evaluation.

            <p eId="para_1181">The IMF has provided a good assessment of Ireland's economic policies and prospects. I note the IMF executive board's concerns about the erosion of competitiveness reflecting a combination of relatively high growth in wages and prices in Ireland over the last number of years.

            <p eId="para_1187">I might first clarify that the Commission has no role in promoting increased cross-Border consolidation as such, as that is a matter for the market. The purpose of the study is simply to identify if any unfair barriers exist that would obstruct cross-Border mergers. That said, the Commission has pointed out that in a truly integrated EU market, cross-Border mergers and acquisitions must be one of the options open to financial institutions. However, it equally acknowledges that financial integration can be achieved in other ways. For example, any EU licensed bank can sell its products throughout the EU through branches in other member states, supervised by its home supervisory authorities, and a number of European banks are active in the Irish market on this basis. Alternatively, they can set up or acquire subsidiaries in the other member states which are supervised by the host supervisory authorities in those member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">A key issue in the cross-Border consolidation context is a provision in the codified banking directive which allows banking supervisors to block a bank takeover on prudential grounds. The financial services industry feels this provision can be abused by some member states to prevent incoming cross-Border takeovers in particular, thus acting as a barrier to cross-Border consolidation. The Commission is developing proposals, in consultation with the member states, to tighten up the prudential criteria on which a takeover approach will be assessed and also to make them more transparent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">On 8 November ECOFIN was briefed by Commissioner McCreevy on actions to improve the regulatory framework for cross-Border mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry and the Presidency reported broad consensus for the continuation of the Commission's work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">I might also note that Ireland has proven itself to be open to cross-Border consolidation, and there have been six foreign takeovers of Irish-based banks in recent years. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has a small domestic banking market, and these foreign market entrants can do much to improve competition.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1194">Section 3 of the Act sets out its functions in regard to advising State authorities on the optimum means of funding public investment projects in order to achieve value for money, including by means of public private partnership arrangements, PPP.

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1195">Under section 21 of the Act, the NDFA provides an annual report not later than six months after the end of each financial year. The report includes the accounts of NDFA which are presented to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. The report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Currently the report provides information on how the NDFA has performed its advisory functions in the year of account, including a list of projects on which it advised, and presents the annual accounts of the agency with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General thereon.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">The impact of maturing SSIA funds on the economy in 2006 and 2007 is subject to ongoing consideration within my Department. The impact on consumer demand is difficult to estimate and will depend on how the accumulated savings are spent or saved, how that portion of an individual's income that was previously saved in SSIAs is used, and the extent to which savings are rolled over into other investment products. The economic effect will also depend on the state of the economy in 2007, when the bulk of SSIA funds mature. To date, a number of reports have been prepared regarding the impact of the SSIAs by, among others, Goodbody Stockbrokers, Lansdowne Market Research, the Irish Mortgage Corporation and the Bank of Ireland. However, there is no consensus in these reports as to how these funds may be used. It is inevitable that there will be a lot of uncertainty about the likely outcomes. As a scheme such as the SSIA has not existed previously, it is not possible to draw on experience as a basis for anticipating the impact the maturing accounts will have on the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">Tax revenue is a product of the level and composition of economic growth. Whatever assessment is made by my Department of the likely economic impact of maturing SSIAs next year will be reflected in the tax forecast for 2006 which will be published in budget 2006. Any impact on tax revenues arising from the economic impact of maturing SSIAs will be once-off.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1204">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the following information is the up to date position on court prosecutions initiated for tax evasion. In 1997, there was one prosecution and one conviction. A fine of €635 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In 1998, there were six cases and eight convictions; fines totalling €42,854 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of six months suspended and one of two years suspended. In 1999, there were two cases and one conviction. In one case a fine of €19,046 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In the other the defendant was acquitted. In 2000, there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling €952 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of two years, reduced to 18 months on appeal, and another of 12 months suspended. In 2001, there were four cases and four convictions. Fines totalling €14,284 were imposed. There were four custodial sentences, one of 12 months, two of six months suspended and another of three months. In 2002, there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling €5,540 were imposed and one custodial sentence of six months. In 2003, there were six cases and seven convictions. Fines totalling €29,365 were imposed and one custodial sentence of two years suspended. In 2004, there was one case and one conviction. A fine of €5,000 was imposed and 180 hours community service was imposed in lieu of a three months custodial sentence. In 2005 to date, there have been seven cases and nine convictions. There have been three custodial sentences, one of 16 months— this is currently under appeal — and two of three months each. In another two cases 240 hours and 120 hours of community service were imposed in lieu of custodial sentences of six months and three months, respectively. Fines totalling €185,400 were imposed. A further five cases are before the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">The Revenue Commissioners have a clear policy of prosecuting cases of serious tax evasion. This function is tasked to their investigations and prosecutions division. Following the restructuring of Revenue in 2003, all investigation activity was consolidated in this division with a remit to co-ordinate all Revenue prosecution work and, in particular, to increase the number of criminal investigations for serious tax offences and ultimately to increase the number of prosecutions. The number of investigators was also increased for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">The most recent figures indicate that this approach is proving successful. There are currently 56 cases under investigation for potential prosecution, the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a further 11 cases and has given directions to prosecute in another six. Bench warrants have been issued in two cases for failure to attend court and, as I stated, five cases are in the court process. Combined with the seven successful prosecutions to date in 2005, of which the conviction and sentence in one case is under appeal, it is the highest overall figure to date and vindicates the decision to concentrate Revenue Commissioners' prosecution resources in one area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1208">The provisions of section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 govern the operation of the scheme for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies. The administration of those provisions is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that primary and secondary schools qualify as approved bodies under the donations scheme once the education being provided is based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">Voluntary contributions by parents to schools can qualify as a relevant donation for tax relief purposes under the scheme once the contribution amounts to at least €250 in a tax year and meets the conditions set out in section 848A. One such condition is that neither the donor nor any person connected with the donor receives a benefit, either directly or indirectly, as a consequence of making the donation. Accordingly, a voluntary contribution in exchange for education being provided to the donor's child would not be regarded as genuinely voluntary and would not qualify for tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">When the scheme was introduced in 2001 Revenue wrote to each primary and secondary school registered with the Department of Education and Science advising them of this new donations scheme and, in particular, of the conditions attaching to donations. Earlier this year, arising from certain concerns, the Revenue Commissioners specifically reminded each of some 90 fee-paying primary and secondary schools that school fees or contributions substituting for school fees did not qualify as eligible donations under the scheme. Contact has also taken place between Revenue and the Department of Education and Science on relevant issues associated with the overall operation of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">The Revenue Commissioners advise me that in 2004, 61 schools out of a total of over 4,000 registered with the Department of Education and Science lodged refund claims in respect of donations by individual PAYE donors. I have also been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they implement controls and monitoring procedures in relation to the operation of the donations scheme in an appropriate and balanced way, commensurate with the risk to the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1214">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total tax debt outstanding at 31 March 2005, as reported in Revenue's annual report and in the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was €1.2 billion, not €2.5 billion as quoted by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">As with any tax system, there will always be people who pay late, people who try to avoid paying and people who can not pay. In this context it is important to note that the debt of €1,217 million at 31 March 2005 is €146 million or 10.7% less than at 31 March 2004. The figure represents 2.5% of annual gross collection and is one of the lowest percentages of any tax administration internationally. This compares to a total debt of 4% of gross receipts in 1999, 15% in 1994 and 30% in 1989. Of this figure, €278 million of the total debt is under appeal with a further €349 million under control or at enforcement. The remainder, €590 million is under active collection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">It is the goal of Revenue, as stated in its statement of strategy 2005-2007, that all debt on record should be less than five years old, or the subject of active enforcement or court proceedings. In this context, I am advised by Revenue that it would expect the current collectible tax debt and any additional debt that will arise for periods up to 31 December 2004, through assessments made by Revenue or submission of overdue returns by taxpayers, would ultimately be reduced over the next five years very substantially. That reduction will be achieved primarily by collection of the debt due.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">Revenue has emphasised the changing element of the debt make-up and the difficulty that this creates in making an estimate of the likely reduction in the debt figure over a five-year period. Revenue's strategies and methodologies adopted to achieve a reduction over a five-year period will be subject to annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">I am broadly satisfied with the rate of both financial and physical implementation of the national development plan, NDP. The monitoring committees for each of the national development plan's seven operational programmes, OPs, have met in recent weeks to consider progress to end June 2005 for their respective programmes. It is estimated that around €39 billion or some 88% of the profiled expenditure for the period of the NDP from January 2000 to end June 2005 has been incurred at end June 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">With respect to the operational programmes, the economic and social infrastructure OP is performing well with expenditure at 102% of profiled expenditure for the period January 2000 to end June 2005. Expenditure on the employment and human resources development OP has achieved 97% of profiled expenditure for the same period and is on course to meet its targets. Performance of the productive sector OP is behind target with 49% of the original profiled expenditure having been achieved. The key factors accounting for this relate to the lower take up of financial opportunities by the private sector and less than anticipated absorption capacity for research and development projects in the BMW region. Despite this, physical performance is close to target for the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">The Border, midlands and western, and southern and eastern regional OPs, are showing absorption rates of 61% and 68% of profiled expenditure for the period January 2000 to end June 2005, respectively. Good progress is evident under the local infrastructure and social inclusion and child care measures. Difficulties still exist in the tourism and agriculture sectors where implementation has been slower and demand for grant support has been less than anticipated. The PEACE and technical assistance OPs are on track to meet their targets by the end of the programming period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">With respect to the eventual outturn for the NDP, I expect the end-2006 position for the key economic and social infrastructure OP and employment and human resources development OP to be close to or above targets. Similarly, the position for the PEACE and technical assistance OPs will be close to their targets at the end of 2006. The regional programmes and the productive sector OP are unlikely to achieve their end 2006 targets.</p>

         asked the

        when the Government will honour the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government that 80% of all earners will pay tax only at the standard rate, especially in view of the fact that the proportion of taxpayers paying at the higher rate is expected to increase from 32.61% in 2004 to 33.17% in 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1246">The 80% target in An Agreed Programme for Government is given in the context of a broader economic and budgetary strategy which provides, among other things, that the public finances will be kept in a healthy condition and that personal and business taxes will be kept down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">Further progress in this area will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual budgets over the next number of years consistent with the Government's overall economic and budgetary strategy. However, I point out to the Deputy that the Government's tax policies since 1997 have ensured that Ireland now has the lowest tax wedge in the EU, and one of the very lowest in the entire OECD as measured by that organisation using comparative data relating to those earning an average production wage. In addition, after tax income, adjusted for CPI inflation, for a person on the average industrial wage, is now 40% higher than it was in 1997. About half of this increase is due to lower taxes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">Moreover, I should add that one reason many income earners pay at the higher rate is because incomes have increased significantly. This is an indication, not of a problem, but of a major economic success.</p>

            <p eId="para_1250">From the outset both the Government and I have made it clear that participation in the decentralisation programme is voluntary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">Because of the nature of the programme it is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of public servants who do not wish to relocate as individual circumstances are open to change and therefore figures can fluctuate. The picture will become clearer over the coming period as staff are assigned to decentralising organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">As people who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin. A number of people have already availed of such opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1255">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Ansbacher review team has been carrying out detailed investigations since October 1999. The investigation has essentially two elements. There are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and 159 of these cases have been finalised. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names. The 289 cases are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors' report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed in the authorised officer's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">A total of 211 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and four cases with insufficient identity information. The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to cases under investigation is now nearly 700.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Revenue has made ten successful applications to the High Court for the production by financial institutions and third parties of books, records and other documentation, which are relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders. Some 200,000 documents have been received under the terms of the High Court orders. Advanced investigative computer software is used in controlling and managing the documentation.</p>

The information in this report has been carefully considered as regards the tax liabilities of the persons concerned. In addition, Revenue made a further application to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the High Court inspectors' report. The High Court order in the matter was granted in June 2004 and perfected in January 2005 and allows for access to documents relating to clients of Ansbacher named in the High Court inspectors' report and those persons and companies, including members of the board, found by the High Court inspectors to have failed to co-operate with their inquiry. The order also allows for Revenue to make application and grounding affidavit for the obtaining of information and documents relating to any other individual or company. Access to documents is subject to the direction of the High Court. Revenue has applied, on foot of the order, for access to documentation in respect of certain cases named in the High Court inspectors' report. Some documentation has been supplied and further documentation is awaited.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1371">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of initiatives has already been taken to inform PAYE taxpayers of their entitlements to tax credits-reliefs and so avoid potential overpayments of tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">Revenue informs me that the vast majority of PAYE workers receive their full entitlements every year. At the beginning of each year a tax credit certificate is issued to every PAYE taxpayer and this reflects the most up-to-date information that Revenue has regarding an individual's entitlements. Revenue completed the issue of 2.24 million such certificates for 2005 in mid-February. Each certificate was accompanied by a simple but comprehensive leaflet giving full details of the credits-reliefs to which a taxpayer may be entitled including: main personal tax credits available for the year in question with comparative figures for the preceding year; tax rates and tax bands for the year in question; exemption limits for single, widowed and married persons; and how to claim an adjustment to the tax credit certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">Revenue uses media advertising on a regular and systematic basis to acquaint taxpayers about their entitlements and to encourage them to claim these. In relation to the PAYE community in particular there is extensive advertising of the budget provisions each year including a Revenue free-phone service which operates for two days immediately following the budget. Again when the tax credit certificates are being issued during January and February each year a newspaper and radio campaign is run to alert people to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">In February 2005, Revenue launched a new self-service option for PAYE taxpayers. This service allows PAYE employees to claim, using the Internet, text messaging or the lo-call 1890 phone number, age credits for those over 65, service charges and trade union subscriptions. It also allows them to request a Form 12 — return of income, a Med 1 — medical expenses claim, a P50 — unemployment claim and a Rent 1 — rent relief. These facilities were widely advertised in the media and were included in the information leaflet issued with the tax credit certificates for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">Revenue also publishes a wide range of claim forms, leaflets and guides on all PAYE credits and reliefs which can be downloaded and printed from the Revenue website or ordered on-line. There is also a 24-hour telephone number available, 1890 30 67 06, for requesting forms or leaflets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">Revenue is well advanced in introducing a redesigned PAYE computer system which, in the early part of 2006, will provide on-line services to PAYE taxpayers including: access to their Revenue records over the Internet to ascertain allowances-credits given and details of pay and tax; amendment of their tax credit details over the Internet, for example, to claim an allowance-credit not on record or to change the amount involved for an existing relief; and requesting an on-line review of their liability or a balancing statement, based on the details available on the Revenue record, including where amended in relation to entitlements. This will further improve the facilities for taxpayers to check whether they have claimed their full entitlements and if not to claim them immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">Revenue already liaises with other State bodies and private institutions to facilitate the granting of credits-reliefs to PAYE taxpayers. For example, liaison in relation to: the tax relief at source, TRS, system which was introduced a number of years ago and which ensures that all those entitled to mortgage and medical insurance reliefs get these reliefs at source and do not have to make a claim to Revenue; and there is an ongoing exchange of information between Revenue and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in regard to certain taxable payments made by that Department to PAYE employees. This interaction will be enhanced considerably through the more timely exchange of information made possible by the redesigned PAYE system already referred to.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">I am accordingly satisfied that Revenue is already very proactive in the manner in which it ensures that PAYE taxpayers are made aware of their entitlements and facilitated in claiming these. Revenue keeps this issue under constant review and takes whatever steps are necessary in relation to public information campaigns so as to continue to inform taxpayers of their entitlements and to simplify as far as possible the arrangements for making these claims. The upcoming bulk issue of over 2.2 million tax credit certificates for 2006 will again be the focus of an information campaign as will the rollout of the PAYE on-line system in early 2006. I emphasise, however, that the primary responsibility for ensuring that Revenue has the most up-to-date information on a taxpayer's affairs lies with the taxpayer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">Article 87(1) of the EC treaty prohibits, in general terms, the granting of aid by the State which distorts competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, in so far as the aid is liable to affect trade between member states. There are a number of components to this provision, all of which must be met before a particular type of support can be classified as a State aid. The principal components are that: the aid in question is granted by a member state, which includes regional or local authorities, or other bodies that are acting on behalf of the State, or through State resources in any form whatsoever; the aid confers an advantage on the recipient; the aid is selective in its application, in as much as it is not afforded to other undertakings in the market in general; the aid is capable of distorting competition, usually by strengthening the competitive position of the beneficiary relative to other participants in the market, and is thus liable to have an effect on trade between member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The EC treaty also provides for circumstances in which State aids may be permissible in light of considerations of public policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The enforcement of the State aid rules across the member states is primarily a matter for the European Commission. It is not the practice of Ministers to comment on areas where, depending perhaps on interpretation of rules, or changing practice or jurisprudence, the Commission might wish to take a view in relation to the Irish tax code. As far as Ireland is concerned, all new proposed tax incentives are examined in light of the State aid rules, and it has been the general practice over recent years to discuss such measures with the European Commission and to notify schemes as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1390">The central scenario underpinning the Central Bank's Financial Stability Report published on 1 November, is that the outlook for the economy is broadly favourable. In overall terms the report concludes, on the basis of a comprehensive and wide-ranging analysis, that the Irish banking system remains in a good state of health and is reasonably well placed to weather possible adverse changes in economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">A key finding of the report is that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels. The report does, however, highlight the continuation of strong mortgage credit growth as an important risk factor. It emphasises, therefore, the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders, to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">I share the Central Bank's assessment of the importance of maintaining financial and economic stability. In this regard, for my part I intend maintaining a responsible approach to maintaining stability in our public finances, which will ensure that the strategic direction of our economy will focus on sustainable real improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure. In this context, I draw the Deputy's attention to Government debt levels, which are the second lowest in the euro area, as well as to Ireland's comparatively high levels of household savings rates, including SSIAs. My Department continues to monitor the effectiveness of the current legislative framework for the regulation of consumer credit by the financial regulator.</p>

            <p eId="para_1400">As previously advised to the Deputy, capital gains tax, CGT, is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order, CPO.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">It was announced in the 2003 budget that no rollover relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. Such reliefs and allowances made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above. In budget 1998, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Taxing capital gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so, and this change brought CGT into line with other areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1432">In addition to those listed, the Minister for Education and Science recently announced her plans to provide 27 new schools by way of public private partnership and, as the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Transport has made a recent announcement about a major investment in transport infrastructure under the Transport 21 investment framework, which includes a significant PPP component.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">In July 2005, I announced a new initiative aimed at accelerating the delivery of PPPs for key capital infrastructure projects in the central government area. The role of NDFA is being expanded to facilitate the consolidation of the relevant skills and capacity required to support PPP procurement in a specialised centre of expertise, responsible for the procurement of all new PPP projects in the central government area with the exception of roads and rail, where existing arrangements will continue. The initiative focuses in the initial stages on progressing projects suitable for PPP procurement in three key Departments, namely the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">The system developed for the selection of public private partnership projects, like other capital projects, is based on the application of the Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure in the Public Sector and complementary PPP-specific guidance issued by my Department. Departments and other sponsoring agencies must also seek the advice of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, on the optimum means of financing the cost of public investment projects or groups of PPP projects over €20 million in order to achieve value for money and on all aspects of financing, refinancing and insurance of public investment projects to be undertaken by means of public private partnership. This system has been developed on the basis of the experience gained with the pilot projects and international experience. We continue to keep the process under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">The selection of projects to be procured by means of PPP is a matter for individual Departments, subject to the overall multi-annual capital investment framework and the relevant guidelines. Also, there are a number of forms of PPP used in Ireland, such as design, build and operate, not all of which involve the use of private finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1451">As the Deputy will be aware from previous statements, duplication of staff in Dublin and the new locations is not planned. The Government has always recognised that, in addition to the personnel who have applied to decentralise, there is another group of equally dedicated civil and public servants who, for a range of personal and other reasons, are not in a position to relocate from Dublin. At the time of the announcement of the programme, the Government made it clear that all of those wishing to remain in Dublin would be offered alternative public service jobs. Arrangements will be put in place to allow staff whose jobs are being decentralised and who opt not to move out of Dublin to be reassigned to other jobs in Dublin. These will be discussed with the trade unions.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1459">There is a North-South dimension to the work of a number of areas in my Department. The lead North-South section in my Department is mainly involved in the process of agreeing corporate plans, business plans and annual budgets for North-South bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement. In co-operation with sponsor Departments, it is also involved in agreeing guidance for the bodies on various matters such as proper financial procedures. This work involves regular attendance at joint North-South meetings and liaison at official level with the Administration in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">In addition, the freedom of information central policy unit of my Department has been involved, with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the NSMC joint secretariat and the OFMDFM in Northern Ireland, in the development of a code of practice on freedom of information to facilitate access to information held by each of the six North-South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited. Drafting of the code was completed earlier this year and was the subject of a public consultation exercise that ran for 16 weeks, ending on 7 October 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">During the consultation period, the code was also implemented on a pilot basis by the North-South bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited, which will continue to operate it on this basis pending formal adoption of the code by the responsible Ministers. The code is based on the provisions of FOI legislation currently in force in both jurisdictions. My Department is also involved in determining the remuneration, grading, numbers, pensions and other conditions of service of the staff of the North-South bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to my Department's substantial contribution to North-South co-operation. My Department actively assists cross-Border co-operation through supporting the Special EU Programmes Body in its role as managing authority to two EU-funded cross-Border programmes. The Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, is one of six North-South implementation bodies set up under strand II of the Good Friday Agreement. It operates under the political direction of the North-South Ministerial Council. The operating costs are met by my Department — 50% — and the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland — 50%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">The two North-South EU programmes are PEACE II and INTERREG IIIA. The aim of the unique EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, PEACE II, is to promote reconciliation and help to build a more peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland and the six southern bordering counties, namely, counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. It has a strong cross-Border focus and a minimum of 15% of funds are allocated to cross-Border activities in the public, private and community sectors. The total value of the overall PEACE effort since its commencement in 1995 is €1,504 million. The value of the PEACE II programme, which was extended at the end of 2004 for a further two years, 2005 and 2006, is €867 million since its commencement in 2000. I am very aware of the importance of the work of the programme to the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The INTERREG IIIA programme, 2000-2006, Ireland-Northern Ireland, aims to address the economic and social disadvantage that can result from the existence of a border. It covers most of Northern Ireland and the six southern bordering counties. All projects must be of a cross-Border nature. The value of the programme is €182 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">My Department is making every effort to ensure that there is continued support for these EU-funded cross-Border programmes as part of the EU budget agreement for the next EU financial period 2007 to 2013. My Department plays an active role in interdepartmental consideration of North-South economic co-operation. As the Deputy may be aware, I have recently emphasised the scope and necessity for such co-operation. In this context, my Department will co-ordinate the drafting of the next national development plan to cover the period 2007 to 2013 and the Government has stressed that this will have an important all-island dimension.</p>

            <p eId="para_1474">The CSO's most recent employment figures, taken from the Quarterly National Household Survey, showed that there were 1,929,200 people employed in the second quarter of 2005. This was an annual increase of 93,000 jobs, or 5.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">The sectors making the greatest contribution to this increase were construction, which was up by 36,400; and financial and other business services, which includes a wide range of service activities and was up by 20,100. Employment in the wholesale and retail trades also grew by approximately 7,000. On the other hand, employment in industry fell by over 6,000 persons and there was a decrease of about 3,000 in agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The CSO's estimate of GDP, that is, the total output of goods and services in the economy, for the second quarter of this year showed an annual increase of 4.1%. Output of all sectors, other than agriculture, forestry and fishing, was up on the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">By comparing the growth in employment and GDP, it is possible to calculate a crude indicator of the trend in labour productivity. For example, employment in the first half of 2005 was up 4.5% and in the same period GDP increased by 3.1%, implying an apparent decline in aggregate labour productivity of about 1.3%. However, care should be taken in interpreting differences between trends in quarterly employment and in GDP because timing differences and statistical volatility can affect the results. It is too early to conclude that aggregate productivity in 2005 has declined but there is evidence in recent years that while labour productivity levels continue to increase, the rate of growth is slower than was previously the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">A major factor influencing the slowdown in the rate of increase in labour productivity is the change in the sectoral composition of the workforce. Productivity rates in Ireland have been exceptionally high compared with other countries because of the large numbers of foreign-owned high-tech industries that generate very high levels of output or value added. However, much of the strong employment growth in employment in recent years has been in other sectors of the economy with the result that the overall productivity levels have not grown as quickly in the past and are moving closer to the international norm. With more persons employed in construction and in the retail and service sectors, average output per worker has not grown as quickly as in previous years, although the total numbers employed have increased at a record rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">In summary, while employment growth in the first half of 2005 has exceeded the growth in output as measured by the GDP, it is too early to conclude that there has been an unexplained collapse in labour productivity. The available information is still limited and part of the fall is explained by changes in the composition of employment. However, this is something that needs to be monitored as more information becomes available.</p>

Three involve the engagement of information technology professionals to develop and provide support for critical projects: integrated taxation services, ITS — the primary internal Revenue computer system; Revenue on-line service, ROS — the public facing pay and file service; and redesign of the PAYE computer system, PAYE. The fourth entailed management consultancy to support Revenue in the initial stages of the design of its large-scale organisational restructuring project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">All of the contracts were subject to open EU competitive tendering. Standard controls were applied to the tendering process and procedures followed as regards adherence to qualifying criteria, rigorous marking against the published acceptance criteria, with final presentation by the short-listed candidates to the specially constituted evaluation groups, which included external expertise as applicable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Given the nature and span of the work, these were multi-year contracts. Expenditure on ROS has been largely funded from the information society fund. The software products that result from this expenditure are tangible assets and are recognised as such in the annual Appropriation Accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">The following table sets out details of the contracts, including the payment made in each year in which there was a payment to the company. The Revenue Commissioners assure me that in each case the work contracted for was delivered in a timely manner, within budget and to specification, and that the office achieved value for money in each case. The continued enhancement and evident success of Revenue's collection, compliance and on-line services would not have been achieved without this expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1530">I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 181 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">As I have already outlined to the House, the stallion stud fee exemption was introduced in Finance Act 1969 and amended in 1985. The stallion relief was included as part of annual reports on aid granted in Ireland to the agriculture sector sent by the Department of Agriculture to the Commission in 1982 and on a number of subsequent occasions. The Commission wrote to the Irish authorities on 24 June 2003 stating a complaint had been received regarding the relief and asked that full details on the exemption be sent to the Commission in order for it to be assessed as a potential State aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">In a subsequent letter of 6 January 2005 to the Irish authorities, the Commission indicated that it had come to a preliminary conclusion that the stallion tax exemption would seem to constitute an aid scheme that is not compatible with the Common Market. The letter set out the Commission's reasoning and, against that background, invited Ireland to submit comments within one month together with any concrete proposals regarding how the scheme in question could be brought in line with Article 87 of the EC treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">Officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food met officials from the Commission Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development on 23 February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">I, along with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food, met the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development in Brussels on 12 May last on this matter. At this meeting, I outlined the background to the relief and the development of the industry in Ireland over the past 30 years setting out the importance of the horse breeding industry here in terms of its contribution to employment and economic activity particularly in rural areas. I also took the opportunity to advise the Commission that, while I fully understood the Commission's obligation to examine the relief on foot of the complaint it has received, it is necessary that the broader European and international aspects of this issue be taken into account. In particular, care should be taken not to disadvantage the Irish horse breeding industry — which is recognised as being a cornerstone of the European industry — relative to competitors from around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">I have reported on these discussions to my colleagues in Government and I have had further correspondence with the Commission on the matter over recent months. However, the issues involved regarding the tax exemption for stallion stud fee income are still under consideration. In the normal course, any proposals for change in tax exemptions are considered in the context of the annual budget.</p>

The €2.8 billion, which does not include spending on disabled persons who participate in and benefit from mainstream services which are available to the community generally, broke down as follows: Department of Health and Children, €2,143 million; Department of Education and Science, €532 million; Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, €63 million; Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, €56 million; and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, €8 million. In addition, the disabled drivers and passengers scheme under my Department was estimated to cost €45 million in tax reliefs this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Subsequently, on budget day, I allocated, for 2005 spending on disability services, a further €60 million capital expenditure to the Department of Health and Children in addition to an extra €3 million for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition, I announced a multi-annual funding package of almost €900 million in capital and current expenditure over the 2006 to 2009 period targeted at the delivery of high-priority disability services. This multi-annual funding was divided between the Department of Health and Children, which received a cumulative €500 million current and €220 million capital, the Department of Education and Science, which received a cumulative €82 million current, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which received a cumulative €40 million capital, the Office of Public Works, which received a cumulative €40 million capital, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which received a cumulative €12 million current.</p>

            <p eId="para_1553">As indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables including where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions over the remaining period of the scheme.

Revenue was not in a position to make any estimate of the numbers in advance of the deadline. Since that date about 5,000 individuals have followed up and made payments totalling €374 million whilst others have indicated that no liability arises. Revenue has been following up on those who having given notice of an intention to disclose did not do so and while final figures are not yet available, it now appears that a substantial number of them will have not have any additional liability.

It tests payment compliance, filing compliance and reporting compliance. Some 400 cases were allocated to the various regions and to large cases division. Most of these audits are either complete or well advanced. A full analysis of the results will not be available until after the end of the year. I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme which is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion by maximising the impact of their resources through focusing on risk. This is strengthened by their new taxpayer compliance testing programme, which ensures that all taxpayers will be exposed to the possibility of a compliance check or Revenue audit. This approach is in line with international best practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">The Centre for Management Organisation and Development is part of the organisation management and training division of my Department and its role is to provide a number of advisory and support services to the Civil Service in the areas of information and communications technology, staff development and management, and common systems development. It also manages delegation arrangements for ICT expenditures in the Civil Service, Garda, Defence Forces, Courts Service and Prisons Service. Delegation is given only where key technical and management practices are in successful use within an organisation, the most important of which are the use of project boards and formal project management techniques in their ICT projects and compliance with competitive procurement procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">In operating the delegation arrangements, Departments and offices are required to submit a broad value for money justification for each of their major ICT project proposals. This justification has to receive my Department's approval prior to any commencement. The delegation arrangements also require Departments and offices to report on an annual basis their progress in relation to projects in the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">Health boards prior to 2005 operated as statutory agencies and their ICT expenditures were dealt with by capital and current grants-in-aid from the Vote of the Department of Health and Children. As a result, CMOD did not have any role in monitoring ICT expenditures in the former health boards and had no involvement in the planning or development of either the PPARS or FISP systems. It is, however, directly involved in the review of PPARS development which is currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">As a result of the increasing size and complexity of ICT projects being undertaken in the context of e-government, it was felt that the delegation arrangements had to be strengthened, particularly for large ICT projects. As the Deputy will be aware the Government recently decided that peer reviews should be immediately put in place for large ICT projects. It is worth noting that forms of peer review are also being implemented in other administrations to deal with size and complexity issues in ICT. In a peer review a team of experienced people external to the organisation would sense check the project sponsors plans and the arrangements they intended to put in place for the completion of the project. Peer review teams would include people with relevant experience from both the public and private sector as appropriate. It is not intended that such reviews would override in any way the accountability arrangements in place within organisations. The peer review process will particularly focus on the preparation of good business cases, on affordability, on the existence of sufficiently detailed plans, on strong governance arrangements being in place and on limiting the scope of a proposed project to the current ICT capacity of the sponsoring organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">It is intended that progress will be made before the end of 2005 in relation to having peer reviews carried out on some large scale projects. In the HSE it is intended to carry out reviews of PPARS, FISP and the planned new hospital information system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">I should emphasise that the peer review mechanism is a significant strengthening of the delegation arrangements as they apply to ICT expenditures. It allows responsibility for the delivery of ICT services to continue to rest with each organisation, while increasing the level of oversight for significant project proposals. The Deputy will be aware of a recent Government decision which significantly strengthens controls in the area of project management and the peer review process will check that these new controls have been taken fully into account. My Department will also be monitoring the development of this new process to ensure its continuing efficacy.</p>

The new fees represent less than 45% of the maximum rates previously payable to tribunal or inquiry counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The Government's legislative programme for the current session includes a comprehensive Tribunal of Inquiry Bill 2005 which is being brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consolidate and reform the legislation relating to tribunals of inquiry. This Bill will also provide a statutory basis for the regulation of third party legal fees payable by the State and to improve the operational efficiency of tribunals. The foregoing measures are aimed at implementing the Government's stated objective of controlling costs associated with tribunals of inquiry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1574">I have been examining proposals for reform of the Estimates and budgetary process in conjunction with my Government colleagues on foot of my budget 2005 announcement that I intended to consider options for reform in this regard. These deliberations are still ongoing and I will also take into account the recent Committee of Public Accounts report. As I indicated in my reply to a previous parliamentary question in the matter, any changes to current practices would have to be capable of being implemented in the short and medium term, would need to meet best practice, improve both the quality of debate and the data available to the House on the budget, meet our obligations to the EU and be capable of being delivered within the existing budget timetable. As I stated in my 2005 budget announcement any changes must also retain the right and duty of the Government to direct and manage the budgetary process. As regards the timing of the budget, it is critical that the Government in formulating the budget has the latest possible information available on fiscal trends before adopting the strategy for the following year. Thus, at present information on revenues to the end of November is to hands when the final budget strategy is adopted. Similar issues arise in determining expenditure for instance on the question of capital spend or possible carryover. I hope to announce the Government's proposals for reform shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">I am fully committed to the principle that every euro of taxpayers' money is well spent.

This initiative builds on other measures introduced in recent years to improve the management of capital programmes and projects including five-year multi-annual budgets and revised guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure. The overall impact of these various developments has created a better framework for achieving value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_1580">It has been a basic feature of our corporation tax code that resident companies are chargeable to tax on their worldwide income and capital gains, with credit for tax paid in countries with which we have a double taxation agreement given against Irish tax payable. Unilateral credit relief may also be available in respect of tax paid in a country with which Ireland does not have such an agreement. While several other countries also apply a credit system, some countries choose to relieve double taxation by providing a full exemption to resident companies in respect of their foreign-sourced income and capital gains. This latter system, under which such companies are exempt from further taxation in respect of repatriated dividends of overseas subsidiaries and profits of overseas branches, is known as participation privilege.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">Limited forms of participation privilege were introduced in Ireland in 1988 for dividends repatriated from foreign subsidiaries — section 222 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 — and in 1995 for companies with foreign branch profits — section 847 of Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. These reliefs were terminated with effect from 15 February 2001 in order to conform with the EU code of conduct on harmful tax practices. Both measures required ministerial certification which had to have been issued before 15 February 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">Section 222 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided an exemption from corporation tax where dividends repatriated from subsidiaries located in countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement were applied towards the creation or maintenance of employment in the State. A certificate had to be given by the Minister for Finance specifying the amount of the dividends qualifying for exemption on the basis of an investment plan for the creation and maintenance of employment in trading operations carried on in Ireland. Such a certificate must have been given before 15 February 2001. In total 12 certificates have been granted to Irish companies although in a number of cases the investment plans were not implemented and so no tax relief was claimed. All the investments made on the basis of approved plans were executed before the end of 1999. Almost €287 million was repatriated for investment here under this relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">Section 847 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for an exemption from corporation tax and capital gains tax in respect of the income and gains of a foreign branch of an Irish company that creates substantial new employment in Ireland resulting from a substantial new investment of permanent capital in the State. The exemption is granted to a company to which the Minister for Finance has given a certificate before 15 February 2001 where the Minister is satisfied that an investment plan submitted to him will result in the creation of substantial new employment in the State and that the maintenance of that employment is dependent on the carrying on of trading operations by the company through a foreign branch or branches. The investment plan must be framed in accordance with published guidelines. The exemption cannot be claimed after 31 December 2010. Three certificates have been granted but in two cases relief had never been claimed. As only one taxpayer claimed the relief, it is not appropriate to give details of the amount involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1587">As outlined by my Department in Economic Review and Outlook, published in August 2005, while the outlook for the Irish economy is one of growth, there are significant downside risks which could alter this picture. One of the risks identified is the pace at which new housing output adjusts downwards to more sustainable levels given that sector's importance in terms of real growth in the economy. Developments in the housing market are being closely monitored by my Department. More broadly, in policy terms, I plan to retain a prudent macro-economic approach focused on improving competitiveness and providing economic stability and certainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_1593">As the Deputy is aware, it is not the practice for the Minister for Finance to announce the income tax or other changes he intends to make in forthcoming budgets. However, I might remind the Deputy that it was this Government that introduced the minimum wage to protect low paid workers and it was this Government which over the last eight budgets removed a record number of about 465,000 workers from the tax net entirely. In addition, I point out that we now have one of the highest minimum wages in the European Union, second only to Luxembourg. Since its introduction in April 2000, the minimum wage has increased by almost 37% taking account of the latest increase, well ahead of inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">As regards the statistics sought by the Deputy, the present entry point to income tax is €14,250 per annum for a single person aged under 65. The latest provisional estimate from the Revenue Commissioners is that there will be roughly 33,000 income earners in an income range which would bring them into the tax net if their annual earnings reflected fully the increase in the national minimum wage. However, this group will of necessity include part-time workers earning more than the minimum hourly wage, and certain pensioners whose earnings are in the equivalent range. The 33,000 should therefore be seen as the upper band for any estimate of the number who may ultimately come into the tax net on a full year basis as a result of the minimum wage increase.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
            <p eId="para_1603">The Government is committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004, involving some 10,300 civil and public service jobs in more than 56 locations. My office is in the process of procuring appropriate properties in the designated locations for the departments and agencies involved, with much progress having been made over the past year. Property acquisition negotiations are completed or are significantly advanced at 23 locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">The prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area have a significant bearing on the cost of acquiring sites. As the acquisition process is still in progress, it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise estimate of the cost of the site acquisition programme. However, for working purposes only, an indicative figure of €75 to €100 million is being used by the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">As the Deputy will know the Decentralisation Implementation Group, DIG, in its report of November 2004 announced the names of the Departments and organisations selected as "early movers" and set out a timetable for provision of accommodation. At the same time the group published a report on the procurement and financial aspects of decentralisation. A further report, of June 2005, updates the timetable announced in November 2004, includes a timetable for the balance of organisations comprehended by the decentralisation programme and sets out commencement and completion dates for accommodation ranging from the final quarter of 2005 to end of 2009. I am confident that this programme will be successfully implemented. In relation to the public private partnership approach recommended by the DIG my office has been developing a comprehensive risk-adjusted costing of project elements to measure the value-for-money of future PPP bids.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on that basis. However, in advance of actual market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large-scale, diverse and complex programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">It is estimated that approximately 210,000 sq m of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme. Current OPW cost norms in respect of standard office accommodation would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of €1,800 per sq m to €2,200 per sq m in suburban and rural locations. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees, inflation and site works. In addition the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at approximately €4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of information and communication technology and specialised equipment requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. Nevertheless it can be estimated that, generally-speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared to central Dublin locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and indeed maintenance costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1611">Section 50 of the Finance Act 2004 provided for the introduction of a limited scheme of relief from excise tax, for biofuels. The purpose of the provision was to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel. As the Deputy may be aware, it was necessary to obtain approval from the EU Commission as the proposed scheme represented a State aid. Approval was granted in March 2005 and the scheme was subsequently advertised by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Excise relief was granted to successful applicants to the scheme from August 2005 for a total of 16 million litres of fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">The current scheme includes excise relief on ethanol production up to a limit of 2 million litres. It is up to the project promoter to choose the most appropriate feedstock to produce the ethanol. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that Maxol, the producer of the 2 million litres of bioethanol under the current scheme, is sourcing the ethanol from the by-products of cow's milk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">The possible introduction of a wider scheme of excise relief for biofuels, including bioethanol, is under consideration. Sugar beet, as under the current scheme, would be an option for bioethanol producers in any such scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1631">I propose to take Questions Nos. 196, 197 and 206 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">The main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 is the Mental Health Commission which was established in April 2002. The commission's primary function is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. To facilitate the establishment of the commission, sections 1 to 5, 7 and 31 to 55 of the Act were commenced in 2002. No further sections of the Act have been commenced to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">A priority for the commission and for the Government at present is to put in place the structures required for the operation of the mental health tribunals, as provided for in Part 2 of the Act. Mental health tribunals will conduct a review of each decision made by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a person on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention. The review will be independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the detention or extension order being signed. As part of the review process the mental health tribunal will arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist and the commission will also operate a scheme to provide legal aid to patients whose detention is being reviewed by a tribunal. The commission has been in discussion with my Department, the Health Service Executive and other relevant agencies in recent months to ensure that all elements of the organisational and support systems required are in place prior to the commencement of Part 2 of the Act. Extensive discussions also took place with the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to securing the co-operation of their consultant psychiatrist members with the implementation of Part 2. No agreement was reached in these discussions, despite a commitment on the management side to invest significant additional resources in the mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">The Secretary General of my Department has now raised the matter of the continuing refusal of the IHCA and the IMO to co-operate with the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001, with the health service national joint council. This relates particularly to the participation of their consultant psychiatrist members on mental health tribunals under the legislation. The Secretary General has made it clear that, unless confirmation of their willingness to co-operate with the implementation of the Act is forthcoming, implementation of the next pay increase due under Sustaining Progress, with effect from 1 December 2005, to consultant psychiatrists would not be warranted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1660">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year cost to the Exchequer, based on projected 2006 incomes, of maintaining the current exemption threshold for the health contribution levy at €20,800 per annum, that is, the annualised value of its current level of €400 per week, is estimated at €137 million in a full year. If the existing threshold was to remain in place and was supplemented by an allowance equal to the first €127, €150 or €175 of weekly earnings, €6,604, €7,800 or €9,100 in annual terms, the additional full year costs are estimated at about €140 million, €165 million or €193 million respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">The current position is that once liability arises, the levy is payable at 2% on a person's entire income, including the portion below the threshold. This has been described as the "step effect" and it can lead to circumstances where an increase in gross pay for a person with an income at the threshold results in a reduction in his-her net take home pay. A €1 increase in annual pay can lead to a net reduction of €8 in net pay per week or about €416 per annum. Where in any tax year, a person's annual income is below the annual threshold, any amounts paid as a result of them having exceeded the weekly threshold may be reclaimed. To abolish the step effect entirely by converting the current levy threshold into an allowance of €20,800 per annum would cost an estimated €442 million in a full year. In such circumstances, only income above the allowance would be liable to the 2% levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">Since 1999, the value of the levy threshold has increased significantly by over 45%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1664">It has been accepted that the current infrastructure at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children does not generally meet the standards required for a modern paediatric hospital. The available facilities do not satisfactorily accommodate the range and extent of current clinical and associated activity. In recognition of this, a project team was established to plan for the overall future development of Our Lady's Hospital, either on the existing hospital site or at an alternative green field location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">The project team has undertaken a detailed examination of the potential to redevelop the hospital on its present site. The project team concluded that the existing clinical services could be retained and developed on the present site but also set out the implications of such an approach in terms of time, cost and disruption to services. As a consequence it is likely that the new hospital will be located at an alternative site. It was also agreed that a number of clinical departments at Crumlin, including the cardiology department, require urgent upgrade or expansion in advance of the overall redevelopment of the hospital. The cardiology project involves the provision of 25 dedicated in-patient cardiac beds, together with improved diagnostic, outpatient and administration facilities. The proposal for the provision of these upgraded facilities is currently under consideration by the Health Service Executive. My Department has asked the executive for a progress report on the cardiology project and I will arrange for this report to be made available to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_1699">In an increasingly integrated global economy, greater competition from low wage economies is inevitable. In these circumstances, we must remain focused on restoring and enhancing national competitiveness in order to maintain employment and to continue to attract inward foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">Developments in domestic prices and wages are a key component of competitiveness. Government policies are focused on this. On an EU harmonised basis, inflation is projected to average 2.2% this year, broadly in line with the euro area average. My decision not to increase indirect taxes in the budget has played a part in this. In addition, sensible incomes policies and a greater role for competition in the economy are also critical to enhancing competitiveness. The consensus approach to wage determination, therefore, has a crucial role to play in ensuring that wage developments evolve in a manner that is supportive of our competitive position. It is also important to maintain spending growth in line with revenue growth, thus keeping the burden of taxation low in order to maximise our economic growth potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">However, as a high income economy, Ireland cannot compete with low wage economies on the basis of wages alone. We must be cognisant of other factors which enhance our attractiveness as a business location, such as the skills of the labour force, the quality of our infrastructure and the stability of the business environment. Going forward, we must seek to continue moving up the value-added chain, attracting investment increasingly from sectors such as information technology, business services and pharmaceuticals, where the skills of the available workforce, the quality of the business environment and the available infrastructure are critical. It is for this reason that the Government remains committed to maintaining capital expenditure at the current high levels relative to GNP in order to reduce the existing infrastructural deficit. Investment in education is also critical in order to provide the Irish workforce with the skills to successfully compete in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1703">The role of Government with regard to credit growth and associated indebtedness has a number of distinct dimensions. First of all, it is important to note that, as far as overall economic and financial stability is concerned, the relevant measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland's fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world with government indebtedness the second lowest in the euro area. Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall, to the maintenance of low unemployment and to the achievement of record employment levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">Similarly, the growth of private sector credit and indebtedness needs to be assessed in an appropriate context. In evaluating the financial position of the private sector, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector's balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house purchase which, in turn, creates an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector underpins high investment levels and the creation of business assets yielding future income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">Account must also be taken of private sector savings levels. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has been actively promoting saving by individuals in the recent past, notably through the SSIA scheme. Comparatively high household savings rates by international standards in Ireland support the sustainability of household debt overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and the individual investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector — one that is both comprehensive and robust. I am satisfied that, on foot of the progress made over recent years, especially in establishing the financial regulator with a particular focus on the interests of the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. This follows from its role as part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the financial regulator, with regard to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">The financial regulator has already drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs. The financial regulator, with its statutory consumer mandate, has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the financial regulator's "it's your money" campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">The Central Bank's recently published financial stability report concludes that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The report does, however, emphasise the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment. I share the Central Bank's assessment of the importance of maintaining financial and economic stability. In that regard, for my part, I intend maintaining a responsible approach to maintaining stability in our public finances, which will ensure that the strategic direction of our economy will focus on sustainable real improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1713">As the Deputy is aware, a special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it — both on an administrative and user level — and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">The group's report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">Following on from the report's immediate recommendations concerning the appeals process, amendments to the regulations governing the scheme were made firstly by my predecessor, and subsequently, by myself, in April and again in September, to improve the operation of the appeals process. These amendments included providing for an expansion from three to 15 of the number of medical practitioners serving on the medical board of appeal — this is expected to substantially reduce the waiting time for appellants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">In respect of the long-term recommendations, I should say that, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance will consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. As the Deputy is aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the budget on possible budget decisions.</p>

Since the closing of the priority application period on7 September 2004, an average of over 20 new applications have been received each week over the past 14 months. The CAF remains open and continues to accept applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">When details of the Government's decentralisation programme were first announced in budget 2004, it was stated that the overall objective would be to ensure that property being acquired at a regional level be matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. In November 2004, the implementation group submitted a report on the procurement methodology and financial assessment of the property aspects of the programme, including a financial model, based on a property finance study carried out by the Office of Public Works. While the prevailing property market conditions in each area will have a bearing on cost, this model indicates that the break even position with regard to property will be reached in 2026.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">The total amount committed in principle to date by the Office of Public Works on site acquisition costs, excluding VAT, is approximately €35.7 million. Expenditure to date this year is €9.9 million. The programme is being implemented on a voluntary basis. There are no redundancies and, as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">With regard to other non-property aspects of the programme, a report was prepared byDeloittes at the request of the implementation group. This report provided a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that might arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised Civil Service. Decentralising organisations have now been asked to use this model to make periodic reports identifying costs incurred and savings made since the programme was announced and going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1733">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as the information furnished on tax returns does not generally require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of economic activity to be identified, the precise figures of net yield of tax revenues collected in respect of the activities specified in the question cannot be readily identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">Information can, however, be provided as to the estimated gross amounts of certain taxes paid, that is, before allowing for repayments, by taxpayers in the construction industry. The gross yield of these taxes from the construction industry was estimated to be €3,253 million in 2004, the latest year for which the relevant figures are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">The taxes in question include internal VAT, excluding VAT on imports; PAYE combined with PRSI from employees and employers; and corporation tax and income tax, non-PAYE. Income tax, non-PAYE, includes direct tax payments received from self-assessed taxpayers and estimated relevant contracts tax attributable to the construction industry but excludes certain "deduction" taxes such as deposit interest retention tax, withholding tax on professional fees and dividend withholding tax, as well as yields from audit and other back duty settlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the four digit NACE code Rev. 1, which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses, there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The figure provided for the estimated gross yield from the construction industry does not include the yield from activities and businesses in other economic sectors, particularly in the professional services sector, which are related either in whole or in part to the construction sector. An example of these would be architecture, engineering and real estate activities. This factor would have a particularly strong effect on the perceived sector distribution of VAT. VAT is levied on taxable activities, that is, provision of goods and services, and, accordingly, the yield from a vatable activity such as construction, can be spread over more than one NACE code grouping.</p>

            <p eId="para_1739">The sale of a new house will give rise to taxes on the purchaser and seller of the house. The purchaser of a new house may be liable to pay stamp duty and VAT, while the seller of such a house may be liable to income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax. The status of the purchaser and the seller need to be taken into consideration in computing these taxes, in addition to the type and value of the house.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">Where stamp duty is incurred it is normally paid by the purchaser. Purchasers who are owner-occupiers are exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the floor area of the house does not exceed 125 sq m and a floor area compliance certificate has been issued by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Where the floor area of the house exceeds125 sq m, stamp duty is charged on purchasers who are owner-occupiers on the site value or 25% of the property value — exclusive of VAT — whichever is the greater, at the rates applicable to second-hand residential property. For investors buying a new house, stamp duty is charged at the rates applicable to second-hand residential property on the full value of the property — exclusive of VAT — regardless of the floor area of the house concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">In this respect, a new house valued at €400,000, is exempt from stamp duty for a purchaser who is an owner-occupier. For a new house with a floor area in excess of 125 sq m this is based on the assumption that 25% of the value of the whole property is greater than the site value. Should the site value be greater, the stamp duty treatment may differ and some charge could arise. In the case of an investor purchasing such a house, a stamp duty charge of €21,145 will be incurred. The rate of VAT applicable on the sale of a new house is 13.5%, so the VAT inclusive price of a house sold for €400,000 will include VAT of €47,577. This amount is reduced by the sum the builder or developer is entitled to claim credit in respect of input VAT suffered on material costs etc. The amount of this claim will vary from property to property.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">Indirectly, any trading profit from the sale of the house will be liable to either income tax or corporation tax, depending on whether the builder-developer is a sole trader or a company.</p>

It was also agreed that the funding provided by France and The Netherlands, 55%, should be used to purchase the mast and transmitter, and Ireland's 45% would fund the purchase of the land and the civil engineering work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">As the mast was never erected, Ireland accepted that moneys were owed to France and The Netherlands in respect of the mast and equipment purchased jointly by them.

The Netherlands agreed to the transfer of the mast and equipment to France without any further formalities.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1797">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 261 to 263, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Neither I nor my Department has any function in decisions on individual claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">With the exception of those participating in my Department's back to education allowance scheme, people in full-time education are excluded under social welfare legislation from receipt of rent supplement or other payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. They are also precluded from receipt of unemployment assistance in this situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">The back to education allowance and related VTOS schemes are special second chance educational opportunities designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups, particularly people who have been unemployed for a substantial period of time and are having difficulty getting a job, to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of gaining employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">To qualify for participation in the back to education scheme, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a period of at least 12 months immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. In addition to the allowance payable, eligible people are also entitled to retain any secondary benefits such as rent supplement which had been in payment to them prior to commencing their educational course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">This scheme is not appropriate to the generality of students who complete their second level education and continue to third level studies in the normal way. The relevant state support mechanism in such cases is the annual third level maintenance grants scheme, to assist people from lower income households towards their living costs while undertaking college courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">None of the three people concerned satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the back to education allowance scheme as they have not been in receipt of a qualifying relevant social welfare payment for a period of at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">The Dublin/mid-Leinster area of the Health Service Executive has advised that while it would wish to be as supportive as possible of the people referred to in the question, in considering each of their applications for supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement, it has determined that they are not eligible for assistance on the basis that they are full-time students and they are not participating in my Department's back to education allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">One of the people concerned has withdrawn from her education course recently and her supplementary welfare allowance entitlements have been restored to her accordingly. The executive has further advised that each of the people concerned has referred his or her case for adjudication by the area appeals office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">In the meantime, the executive will also review the cases in question to consider whether rent supplement may be paid in these cases as an exceptional measure given the particular circumstances in which these individuals are seeking to improve their situation. Decisions on these individual appeals and the outcome of the local case reviews are expected shortly and the people concerned will be notified of the outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_1809">Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a recipient of a social welfare or Health Services Executive payment who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity can apply to his or her local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">The south eastern area of the executive has advised that the person concerned had previously been in receipt of a heating supplement. In the course of a review it came to the attention of the executive that the person's means and circumstances had changed. The executive contacted the person concerned in order to determine his current means and personal circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">He subsequently indicated to the executive at the beginning of November that he no longer wished to be paid a heating supplement. In the light of this question, the executive has contacted the person concerned again this week to clarify his current situation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1821">I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 to 270, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The company in question is a worldwide supplier of information and communications technology, ICT, industry research to suppliers and users of ICT. It has a number of services based around its continuous research programme. In addition to the provision of standard research papers and provision of access to the authors and analysts, it offers an executive programme aimed at senior ICT managers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">The executive programme provides additional research reports, which are not otherwise available, on deploying technology for business growth. It also provides access to additional on-line resources. The programme is supported by dedicated local and worldwide staff who actively liaise and follow up on specific issues. They also facilitate a number of local events for their membership, comprising public and private sector chief information officers, at which best practice and experiences are shared. Members are entitled to VIP status at company events. Essentially, this means they have preferential access to the industry analysts at the events and they receive tickets as part of their subscription.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">Although there have been a number of companies offering research and advisory services, the company in question has a worldwide reputation as the leading independent adviser in the industry. It offers a particular combination of research covering current and future technology in general, suppliers and their strategies and also reports on how ICT has been deployed in various industry sectors, including the public sector, worldwide. It supplements this research with a programme of direct support to senior ICT management which provides strong quality assurance for overall ICT strategy as well as advice on specific projects and technologies. It also includes making analysts available to senior business management as required. In addition to the industry monitoring and quality assurance aspect of the service, my Department considers that the programme offers strong support for personal development at a senior level. My Department had previously participated in other research programmes but, due to resource constraints, these have been discontinued. It also avails of ICT-related advice from various other sources but not on a membership basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">When the specific programme was designed in late 2000, my Department provided a business case to the Government contracts committee seeking sanction to join. The advice received was that the executive programme was a membership or subscription service and not subject to the normal contract procurement regulations. The membership service has not been the subject of an internal audit review. The director of my Department's IS division is a member of the programme along with one of the principal officers within the division, who is nominated as a back-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">Apart from the facilitation of peer interaction locally, the company organises a particular set of worldwide conferences twice yearly in Europe, one in Cannes in winter and one in Barcelona in spring. It also organises similar events in the United States and Asia. These worldwide events provide a mix of technology scenarios, a discussion of the external influences and constraints on a particular aspect of the industry and a forecast of how that sector will develop over the next few years, and commentary on specific suppliers and product lines. Typically, there would be up to 50 analysts presenting about 150 sessions over four to five days. My Department considers that, while it is a very intensive seminar, it provides an unparalleled opportunity for technical refresh, that is, updating of knowledge, personal development by providing a view across the whole industry and peer discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">Since the executive programme commenced in 2001, the director of the IS division has attended one conference as part of the executive programme in Barcelona in spring 2004, at a cost of under €500. In addition, a principal officer in the IS division availed of the executive programme membership to attend the conference in Cannes in winter 2002, for a cost of under €1,300. The cost of attendance is included in the membership, so the costs incurred are for the relevant economy flights, hotel cost and standard subsistence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">My Department has a budget of more than €12.2 billion and is responsible for more than 970,000 transactions each week, which rises in a full year to almost 60 million transactions, covering a wide range of schemes. Therefore, my Department is highly dependent on information and communications technology to support schemes, produce payments and deliver a proactive service to customers. It is highly desirable that ICT management engages in professional development and keeps informed of industry best practice. I am satisfied that the services availed of represent value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_1837">Since the start of 2000, applications for TEN-T, trans-European networks-transport, financial support for projects in Ireland have been submitted, in the main, within the framework of the multi-annual indicative programme 2001 to 2006, MIP. The financial assistance is committed by the European Commission on an annual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">The following are details of the applications submitted since the start of 2000 for road and rail projects for which Commission decisions have been received to date. In the case of road projects, aid amounting to €37.017 million for the planning and design of the Ireland element of the Ireland-UK-Benelux road link project was applied for and €24 million in aid was approved; aid amounting to €2.991 million for the N8 Cashel bypass project was applied for and €1.8 million in aid was approved; and aid amounting to €6.938 million for the N1 Dundalk to the Border with Northern Ireland project was applied for and €3.3 million in aid was approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">In the case of rail projects, aid amounting to €15.2 million for the elimination of a number of key permanent speed restrictions on the Belfast-Dublin-Cork intercity rail corridor project was applied for and €7.6 million in aid was approved; and aid amounting to €4.4 million for a project undertaking safety and upgrade work in conventional TENs routes was applied for and €3 million in aid was approved. This application was made outside of the MIP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">In addition to the above, two projects, namely, INSTANT and STREETWISE were undertaken by the NRA in collaboration with the authorities in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom which were supported under the TEN-T budget. The INSTANT, information and management system for multimodal transport in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, project is a joint project between the NRA and the Roads Service of Northern Ireland. The application for funding was made in 2000 and the amount of aid approved by the Commission was €1.398million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">The main applicant and beneficiary of the STREETWISE, seamless travel environment for efficient transport in the western isles of Europe, project was the United Kingdom's Department for Transport. The application for funding was made in 2001, and was approved by the Commission as a multi-annual indicative plan for the 2001 to 2006 period.

            <p eId="para_1858">No public relations company was used for the launch of Transport 21. There were no costs for the use of Dublin Castle. Costs were incurred for catering at Dublin Castle, producing backdrops, graphics, associated printing and producing a video. The required public procurement procedures were complied with in accordance with Government procurement guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">A company called <i>Webmaster.ie</i> produced the video, which cost €18,750 plus VAT. Details of the other costs incurred will be made available to the Deputy when invoices have been received and payments finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1957">My Department is responsible for enforcement of European Union rules governing drivers' hours and the use of tachograph recording equipment in heavy goods vehicles to monitor compliance with prescribed breaks and rest periods for drivers. Enforcement checks are carried out at the premises of the operator and at roadside checks. These rules came into force on 29 September 1986 and are set out in Council Regulations Nos. 3820/85/EEC and 3821/85/EEC. The rules apply to drivers of vehicles used for the carriage of goods where the maximum permissible weight of the vehicle, including any trailer or semi-trailer, exceeds 3.5 tonnes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">The EU Commission's proposals to upgrade the enforcement of drivers' hours rules is in the conciliation procedure between the Council and the European Parliament with a view to finding a compromise leading to final adoption. This will result in higher levels of drivers' hours monitoring and, through the introduction of the digital tachograph a more secure and tamper proof system of controlling drivers and ensuring adequate rest and breaks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">With regard to the issue of controlling the standard of truck driving, while monitoring of drivers' hours clearly makes a contribution to safer driving, the ultimate qualification standard is the HGV driver licence, which shows that a driver has trained and passed a recognised level of competence in trucks. In addition, EU Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the training of professional drivers will require EU professional drivers to follow a programme of professional driver training. The training will be compulsory for all persons seeking to become professional drivers and will comprise of training for an initial qualification followed by periodic refresher training equivalent to one day training per annum. Member states have until 10 September 2006 to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive. Such enhanced training regimes should make a further contribution to road safety in regard to commercial vehicles.</p>

These modern commuter railcars are fully accessible and bicycles can be conveyed on these trains outside the commuter peak periods. By 2007-08, 120 Intercity railcars for use on long distance regional services will have been delivered to Iarnród Éireann. These trains will have suitable accommodation for bicycles and will ultimately enable commuter railcars to be allocated predominately to suburban services, thereby ensuring greater access to facilities to transport bicycles on longer distance trains.</p>

            <p eId="para_1978">Transport 21 provides for funding for quality bus corridors, QBCs, traffic management and park and ride in regional cities throughout the period up to 2015. However, Transport 21 does not allocate funding for any specific quality bus corridors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">It is a matter for the local authorities to prioritise the most suitable routes for QBCs and to apply to the Department for funding. The Department has no application on hands for funding for a QBC from Loughgeorge towards Galway city. The possibility of a QBC from Loughgeorge towards Galway city has been the subject of extensive discussions between Galway County Council and the NRA since 2004. The outcome of that discussion was that the road from Parkmore junction towards Galway city centre was identified as the most suitable stretch of the N17 for implementation of a QBC primarily as it can be located in a reduced speed limit zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">Galway County Council has recently commenced work, with funding from my Department, on a quality bus corridor on the N17 from the Parkmore junction in an inward direction towards Galway city centre in order to assist in the alleviation of congestion on the N17 route. My Department has also funded the implementation of 800 metres of quality bus corridor in Galway on the Dublin Road from the Skerritt roundabout to the Renmore road, which was officially opened in February 2005. Galway City Council is currently carrying out a 2 km extension of this quality bus corridor on the Dublin road from the Skerritt roundabout to the Doughiska road with funding from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">In addition, my Department is also making funding available for a major consultancy study, commissioned by Galway City Council, to examine the potential for additional bus priority, bus transportation and park and ride in Galway city and environs. Funding will be available under Transport 21 for suitable QBC, bus priority, and park and ride proposals that emerge from this consultancy study.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">The bypassing of Claregalway, which should alleviate traffic congestion around the village, is part of the N17 Galway to Tuam project consisting of 25 km of high quality dual carriageway. The design work on the N17 project is continuing on an ongoing basis and it is expected that the environmental impact assessment-compulsory purchase order will go to a hearing during 2006. All the above measures will help to alleviate traffic congestion and to improve traffic flow within Galway city and in the city environs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2042">With effect from 1 January 1993, unsocial hours allowance, which covers night duty, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays was made pensionable under the Garda Síochána pension scheme. There are 1,446 Garda pensioners who retired prior to 1 January 1993 and who do not receive the benefit of unsocial hours allowance in their pensions. The current annual average rate of pension payable in respect of unsocial hours allowances is approximately €4,000 per Garda member. The current annual cost to the Exchequer of awarding a pension based on unsocial hours allowances to those members who are not in receipt of such pension benefits is estimated at €5,784,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">There are also a number of Garda widow's pensions in payment to the widows and children of deceased members who retired prior to the date in question. However, it is not possible to readily ascertain the cost of paying unsocial hours benefit to these pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">The position on the pensionability of Garda allowances is that the Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations have been agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group and a report from the Garda parallel working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">The commission considered the issue of parity of pensions for members of the Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1993 who do not receive the unsocial allowance element in their pensions, and for those who retired prior to 1982 who do not receive rent and other allowance elements in their pensions. The commission also examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of the Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations, but having assessed the arguments, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved. Having regard to the commission's report, I have no plans to initiate a further review on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2055">I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 to 352, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">My Department has a basic entry level contract with the company in question for vendor independent research material on the IT industry worldwide. The contract is for one senior official to have access to all the research material in question with regular reports on areas of special interest and also to request deeper analysis, as required. There are a number of briefings offered each year as part of this basic service. While there is a vast quantity of free information or material supplied by vendors available in the public domain, it is considered appropriate that a more substantive source is also availed of, especially when considering claims of rival vendors. The value of the contract with the Department in 2005 is €14,250. This is considered to represent good value for money and a more cost effective way of obtaining independent and reliable information than commissioning periodic studies and reviews. Above all, access to this service helps my Department to ensure that IT procurement decisions are soundly based and that good value for money is achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">At the time of the award of the initial contract in 1998 the Department availed of a central Civil Service wide agreement with the firm in question for analysis services which had been facilitated by the Centre for Management, Organisation and Development or CMOD. Since then our contract has varied slightly over time and at each renewal other companies' products are examined. The situation will be reviewed again when the current contract expires next year, in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the procurement of goods and services. Given the wide range of goods and services procured by my Department every year, it is not possible for the internal audit unit to review every individual procurement. It would be a departure from normal audit practice were the unit to do so. Our internal audit has had no particular reason to examine the procurement referred to by the Deputy and has no evidence to suggest that the Department of Finance guidelines were not adhered to.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">In so far as the additional services and executive programme referred to by the Deputy are concerned, the position is that my Department is not a member of that programme and no staff member from my Department has attended the event mentioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_2337">My Department's approach to tackling disadvantage has been refined in more recent initiatives to ensure that individual, at-risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating schools as disadvantaged, we now provide supports that are commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">The school to which the Deputy refers is included in the rural dimension of my Department's Giving Children an Even Break programme, aimed at combating educational disadvantage. The school receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">A key element of delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantaged experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters and communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools regarding the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2343">The North-South Ministerial Council agreed at a sectoral meeting in February 2000 that a joint working group on teachers' superannuation should be set up to consider the question of transferring the superannuation entitlements of teachers between this State and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">The working group has identified a range of options for effecting transfer arrangements. The group is fully aware that the superannuation arrangements of teachers cannot be considered in isolation and that any arrangements proposed in the case of teachers will have to have full regard to the costs and other implications for employers in the public sector generally. In this context, the North-South Ministerial Council, which established the group, decided at its plenary meeting on 28 June 2002, that a broad-based working group should be set up to consider the question of superannuation generally, including the mobility of pension rights not only between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland but between this jurisdiction and the wider United Kingdom. The North-South Ministerial Council was suspended, however, before it could formally establish the broad-based group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">Pending a return to devolution and the establishment of the broad-based working group, it is unlikely that any arrangements for North-South transfers can be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">I should add that the College of Commissioners of the European Union has recently proposed that a directive be made by the European Parliament regarding the portability of pension rights between member states. These proposals will be taken account of by the joint working group on teachers' superannuation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2358">I am conscious of the pressures being placed on education providers in areas of major population growth. In this context, my Department is prioritising the provision of new and enhanced educational facilities in these areas. The prioritisation criteria, recently revised in consultation with the education partners, allocates a top priority, band-one, rating to school building projects in such areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">My Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment. As a matter of course, meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and sites are reserved, where necessary, to ensure, as far as possible, the timely delivery of any required education infrastructure. Furthermore, under the provisions of the strategic development zones, SDZ, it is generally the position that sites must be reserved for schools and also that the schools must be developed in line with the housing and other developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">In addition, the school planning section of my Department is working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising my Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs, while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2361">With regard to the provision of sites for school infrastructure, the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 do not place any onus on developers to provide school sites other than at market rates. I am keeping an open mind on whether legislative change might be of assistance or prove the best way forward here. Any changes in this area would require careful consideration in the context of constitutional protection for private property and, indeed, in weighing up how any reduction in the price per acre of any land given for schools development might impact on the unit costs and affordability of houses developed on the remaining lands.</p>

            <p eId="para_2372">The Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which was launched in July 2004, started a process that will lead to a significantly enhanced Reserve Defence Force capability while ensuring the preservation of the traditional strengths of the reserve such as the spirit of voluntary commitment, the maintaining of strong links with local communities and a nationwide geographical spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">On 1 October 2005, an important milestone in the process was reached with the introduction of the new reserve organisational structures. The reserve is now organised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force with an Army reserve comprising three brigades and a Reserve Defence Force training authority and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve. The close working and support relationship between PDF and RDF units is an important contributory factor in ensuring that the RDF will acquire the appropriate capabilities as well as enhancing RDF and PDF interoperability, which is a key focus of the implementation plan. This will require co-operation between affiliated PDF and RDF units. The RDF training strategy specifies a number of ways in which the PDF and RDF will co-operate in training for improved capabilities and interoperability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">The revision of RDF training syllabi and the acquisition of modern weapons for RDF units will contribute to enhanced RDF capability and interoperability. In addition, the provision of PDF instructors to RDF units during periods of full-time instruction, RDF personnel undertaking training with PDF units, RDF personnel participating in exercises with PDF units, PDF assessment of RDF training and the PDF providing training facilities including transport, equipment and infrastructure for RDF training, are just some examples of the type of support and working relationships that are envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">The development of the integrated element of the reserve will further enhance the working and support relationship between the PDF and the RDF, as will the development of policies for the selection of suitably qualified reserve personnel for overseas service. The military authorities carefully considered all of the aforementioned issues in developing a plan for the new reserve organisational structures. The widespread consultation that was a feature of the planning process was an essential factor in ensuring that the new reserve organisational structures are consistent with the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan requirements. The plan was supported by the representative associations in particular the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association and I am confident that new reserve organisational structures throughout the country are appropriate and will contribute to a greatly enhanced reserve capability.</p>
