That is an increase of approximately 60% over the next 20 years. Anybody who feels this is sustainable and that we will be able to function is living in cloud cuckoo land. The Fianna Fáil Government since 1997 has invested hundreds of millions of euro in Dublin: the Luas project, the Dublin Port tunnel and the Ringsend sewage treatment plant, which on its own accounts for about €210 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">Several billion euro have been invested in Dublin over the last few years. Anyone who says this Government has not been committed to proper investment in Dublin simply does not know what he or she is talking about. I am surprised that Fine Gael Deputies in particular have not done their homework. Anybody who knows anything about spatial planning realises that Ireland has the highest concentration of population in its capital of any country in Europe, except Luxembourg. These are some of the percentages: Belgium – Brussels 9.5%; Germany – Berlin 4.1%; Italy – Rome 4.3%; France – Paris 16.2%; Portugal – Lisbon 18.7%; Finland – Helsinki 10.8%; and Ireland – Dublin 28.7%. That is completely unsustainable from a planning point of view.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_23">If people took the trouble to read the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office, they would understand that the population of Dublin is due to increase by 60%. Fine Gael is now in favour of a 60% increase in house prices. Fine Gael is in favour of 60% more traffic congestion in our city. It is a sad day for Ireland when the major Opposition party cannot do its research and comes out against a rational plan for decongesting Dublin and supporting balanced economic development throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I am not surprised because I took the trouble to read the speeches of Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Burton on the previous budget. If anyone takes the trouble to read the speeches from last year, they will see that both of them criticised two aspects on which they were entirely silent following this year's budget. Deputy Bruton criticised the special savings incentive account scheme and the pension schemes. He stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_25">How can the Minister for Finance ask the lowest paid in our community to accept that there will be no increase in their tax credits . . .  while at the same time he is going to protect those who can afford to save in these schemes? Where is the justice or equity in that?</p>
          <p eId="para_26">There was no reference this year to the SSIA scheme. He went on to criticise the national pension reserve fund as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_27">It is not justice or equity that is inspiring this but pride and ego. That is where this Government has gone so badly wrong. There is €1,300 million being stashed in the Minister for Finance's great pension fund. I agree with the principle of the pension fund. I am glad it was put in place. I do not agree, however, that at a time of serious bottlenecks in our infrastructure we should be using €1,300 million of taxpayer's money, most of it borrowed this year, in order to invest in the stock exchanges of New York and Japan.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The fact is that the stock exchanges of New York and Japan will deliver large increases to the capital value of the national pension reserve fund for the next few years. The stock markets are recovering and the value of that pension fund will increase significantly over the next few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Last year Deputy Burton also criticised the SSIA and the pension fund by stating:</p>
          <p eId="para_30">He cuts investment and insists on shovelling money into a pension fund, which will not be invested in the country's infrastructure and which is losing money hand over fist on international stock markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">In her speech this year there was no reference to the national pension reserve fund because she knows that the value of the pension fund will increase enormously over the next few years. She is embarrassed by what she said one year ago. I predict the fund will grow by 10%, 20% or even 30% over the next few years, while at the same time the Government has kept its promise of investing in this country. It is investing €5.5 billion a year in capital expenditure, which is a record across the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I do not understand the Opposition's position in this regard. Does it oppose benchmarking and decentralisation? If so, what exactly does it support? I was dismayed by the speeches made by Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Burton. They had nothing positive to say. There were no words of congratulations for the Minister for Finance who in recent years has steadily brought us down to one of the lowest tax economies in Europe, which is essential. Ireland will be competing against the ten new countries joining the European Union. These ten countries, which have very low cost bases and many of which have very low tax bases, will compete with us job for job. If we do not have a low tax base, we will haemorrhage jobs to eastern Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">That is not to suggest that there is room for complacency. We must reduce our cost base. I do not understand the logic in the Opposition's point of view.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_39">It is something which will be reflected in time. I welcome decentralisation. However, I would like to clarify a few issues. I assume the Government's cap on employment in the public service still stands, which should be clarified for people. Laoighis-Offaly is getting 965 jobs, which I welcome, as I am sure do my constituency colleagues. However, we are not getting new jobs in the sense of replacement industry for the jobs lost. It is great for the people of Birr, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Edenderry and Tullamore that public servants will come to live in the constituency. It will benefit the towns and provide more business for shops, restaurants, etc. but it will not replace the jobs that have been lost. It will not replace the 400 jobs lost in Leoni in Birr, the hundreds of jobs lost in Flextronics and Daiber in Tullamore or the jobs lost in Powerscreen in Kilbeggan.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_44">It is an important point to realise. While I welcome the benefits of decentralisation, it will not replace the jobs lost. The Government is not off the hook because of this announcement. It must be accepted that we still need replacement industries for those lost. I accept it is a nice position for the Government, but the reality is clear for the people who will not benefit from this measure in the sense that it will not create employment for them. The announcement on Wednesday was not relevant to the budget. It was a smokescreen to deflect from the proposals in the budget, a bit like the smokescreen of the smoking ban to divert attention from the conditions in many of our hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I would like to refer to the budget from an education perspective. These are some of the real issues we must accept. The Estimates announced last month indicated there would not be good news in the budget for education, which was confirmed last Wednesday. The Ministers for Finance and Education and Science have tried hard to create a myth that the budget will work for education. It will become clear that this is not the case because 2004 will produce real cutbacks. This is at a time when education services have already been cut back. If one examines the amount of money being spent on pay increases in the education sector, on the allocation to the institutional redress and child abuse boards and the demand-led schemes, current spending in the Department of Education and Science will have been reduced by €20 million for next year. I do not think there is any way of dressing that up and making it look better than it is. This will have a direct knock-on effect for everyone relying on the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">On Wednesday, the Minister announced an additional allocation of €30 million for the schools building programme. Given the appalling conditions in so many primary and post-primary schools, I welcome the allocation. However, it should be put in context and we should not clap ourselves on the back too quickly. Last year the Minister for Education and Science underspent on his capital allocation by more than €60 million. This was at a time when schools were crying out for grants for refurbishments and building extensions. There is no explanation why the money was not spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">When attending the Committee on Education and Science yesterday, the Minister for Education and Science said that the money was or will be spent somewhere in his Department. That is not good enough. We are entitled to know why the money was not spent on the capital projects on which it should have been spent. Given the number of schools seeking building extensions, refurbishment and proper access for people with disabilities, I do not understand how the Minister could fail to spend €60 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">More than 400 schools are on the school building programme, many of which have planning permission for their projects which are ready to proceed to tender, yet the Minister did not spend the money. There is no decent explanation for this. I do not believe that he can transfer willy-nilly €60 million to some other section, as he pretends. We need an explanation as to where exactly is that €60 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Science facilities in many of our post-primary schools are sub-standard or non-existent. We have witnessed the difficulties faced by the Minister for Education and Science when he tried to introduce a new junior certificate science syllabus. We are told that only 12 of our post-primary schools have no science facilities. The reality is far different. I have seen schools that are considered to have science laboratories but they are so antiquated that they cannot be used. I was in one school where it is hoped the Health and Safety Authority will not come knocking on its door because, if it did, its science laboratory would be closed immediately because of its dangerous state. Yet that is considered to be a laboratory. I do not understand how the Minister can justify that. Given that the Minister for Education and Science knew there would be opposition to introducing the new junior certificate science syllabus because of the existing poor facilities, I do not understand how he can leave €60 million unspent from capital programme. The Minister said it was €30 million in the budget and €23 million in the Estimates, which amounts to €53 million. Even if he is recycling the money, as it seems he is, that still leaves an extra €7 million unaccounted for by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">This budget will cause severe hardship for children and their families, particularly those waiting for psychological assessments. These assessments are critical. They provide valuable assistance to parents and teachers in discovering the best way to teach a child who may have a specific learning requirement. The appropriate intervention, at an appropriate time and as early as possible, can have a positive effect on children for the rest of their education and for their lives. If children are assessed prior to the age of six or seven they can participate fully in the education system with fewer special requirements in the long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">The provision for the National Educational Psychological Service in the Estimates has effectively been cut. We have seen an increase of 1% in the allocation to the National Education Psychological Service. This will not meet the existing demands of NEPS, not to mention expanding and rolling out the scheme. As well as its current workload, the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill which is being debated places huge demands on the National Educational Psychological Service. It envisages a far greater roll-out into the education system and more NEPS staff will be required to do what is required under the Bill. We are proposing to pass legislation when we are cutting the funding from the agency that is supposed to provide this service. It does not make any sense. I do not believe NEPS will be able to meet the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Even in parts of the country where the highest number of its psychologists are deployed, more than one school in ten is not covered by NEPS. The figures for the mid-west, north-west and the midlands are truly appalling. In the mid-west region 71% of schools are not covered, in the north-west region 57% of schools are not covered and in the midlands region 44% of schools are not covered. The figures for other parts of the country are similarly worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">In his recent report, the Comptroller and Auditor General revealed that since 2002 the Department has spent more than €2 million funding private psychological assessments because its own service has not been rolled out as efficiently and comprehensively as it should have been. In the absence of the NEPS in one's locality, it is right and proper that children are allowed get a private assessment but it does not make sense to continue to do it in this way. If the service was rolled out properly and the money put into a fully fledged national service there would no need to spend this amount on private assessments. Unfortunately neither the NEPS system nor the provision of private assessments reach all the children in need of these service. This is deeply worrying. In recent months a number of families in my constituency have spent €1,200 each to have their children assessed because of the inadequacy of the service provided by the Department of Education and Science. Many of these families have borrowed to meet this expense. For children waiting for an assessment from NEPS the message from the budget is clear, "Hold on and keep waiting and we might get around to you in a year or two".</p>
          <p eId="para_54">I wish also to focus specifically on the National Educational Welfare Board. A year and a half after its establishment the board is nowhere near to meeting its targets for the recruitment of education and welfare officers. As with NEPS, huge parts of the country have no access to the National Educational Welfare Board. The announcement earlier in the week of an expansion of the service is still seriously short of what is required. The number of education and welfare officers employed to date is far short of the target sought by the National Educational Welfare Board. The lack of funding provided by the Government has created this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Prior to the establishment of the board, schools could report any prolonged student absences to the Garda Síochána but since last year the Garda has no statutory entitlement to any function in this area. This is a shift in emphasis which I welcome. It was not appropriate for the Garda to be involved but there was no other system in place at the time. It is away from prosecution from forcing children into schools and is a more holistic approach looking at the reasons behind a child's absence from school. The chronic shortfall in officers means the Government has not provided any alternative form of assistance to schools with these problems. The Garda Síochána is not entitled to be involved, yet the officers of the National Educational Welfare Board are not in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">It is unacceptable, despite the Minister's attempt to create the impression of a huge improvement, that some counties, including Laois and Offaly which I represent, are left without any dedicated welfare officer. Some 73 are employed throughout the country. yet those two counties do not have one between them, not to mention one each. The increase of 1% for the National Educational Welfare Board in the Estimates will not even be in line with inflation. The board wanted to recruit its officers in three phases to roll out a nationwide service. However, the allocation to the board in the Estimates will not allow it complete the first phase. The Minister is deliberately ignoring the fact that the National Educational Welfare Board has a statutory duty to carry out specific functions, a duty it cannot fulfil without the proper provision of funding by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">All the long-term positives for individuals and society that arise from tackling early school leaving and drop-out rates are being ignored by a Government that cannot see a bigger picture. I fully accept the Minister's point that we do not need or want a duplication of services. That is a waste of money. I do not believe the National Educational Welfare Board is trying to duplicate its services. At present it is barely able to react in basic way and in some places it is not reacting at all. Its function is not just to be reactive but to offer positive answers and ways of addressing drop-out rates rather than the heavy-handed forcing of people into a school situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">The budget is a sharp blow also to the third level sector. Our universities and third level colleges have been through a period of uncertainty and confusion. Last year the planned release of vital investment to build and equip laboratories and scientific research facilities was put on hold, even though it was a stated objective of the Government to ensure Ireland developed a world class research capability. I welcome the fact that this hold has been removed. We have to plan for this sector in a more definite way. Research and attracting researchers from abroad cannot work if we put it on a stop-go. They have to know that if they come to Ireland they will be able to continue to carry out their research here.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">This year, it was the turn of capital programmes in the universities and institutes of technology to suffer savage cutbacks. There was a reduction of 47% in building grants and capital costs at the institutes of technology, and a 45% reduction in the same area for universities. How does this square with the commitment in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government to support advanced research in the physical renewal of third level campuses? It is not good enough to say it cannot continue to apply for new buildings and expect them to be funded. It is only a year and a half since the programme for Government was drawn up. Our campuses have not changed or improved dramatically since that time. Did the Government believe what it negotiated then? Why include something in a programme for Government if there is no intention of doing anything about it? It appears to me that it was nothing more than a token nod to our universities and institutes of technology. Rather than a real attempt by Government to foster and assist in the development of a dynamic, forward looking education sector with well-developed research facilities, capable of attracting people from all over the world, we have taken out the scissors and cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Already we are hearing about university libraries closing earlier. One college is taking an extended Christmas break to save on heating and lighting bills. That is not acceptable. If this is what the budget means for the third level sector we have to be worried about the long-term damage this may do to third level education in Ireland, the third level facilities being curtailed, the consequences for the students of today and tomorrow and Ireland's reputation as a knowledge-based economy. After the last general election third level students had to cope with a 69% increase in college registration fees. Those fees have increased again by €80 to €750 per annum. The idea of free education is one that does not hold much sway on the other side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">I wish to refer to the effect of the budget on those involved in youth work nationally. I met representatives of the National Youth Council on Wednesday evening who were a very disappointed group. The importance of youth work programmes and other similar initiatives in the non-formal education sector has been overlooked by the Department of Education and Science. Youth work will receive very small increases in funding in 2004, far less than the organisations involved hoped for. The National Youth Council said the budget bypasses young people and raises serious questions about the Government's commitment to them. The Government has failed to recognise the benefits that derive from youth work programmes. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would not require so much money for his budget if more was given to the Department of Education and Science.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Were it not for decentralisation, this would have been a non-budget. There was nothing to talk about. All the ills that existed previously still exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">I spent a lifetime seeking decentralisation of Departments and other facilities. As far as this change goes, I welcome it. There is no reason Departments will not work in these areas. There might be some difficulties at policy level but they can be overcome. We are led to believe that the thousands of people who would like to live and work in their own areas will be facilitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">I do not know, however, which Minister will be handling the programme. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance takes up the front page of half of the national daily newspapers to congratulate himself and I do not know what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is at now. There seems to have been a change of policy because the decentralisation of jobs will be arranged in an extraordinarily uneven manner. When speaking on the national spatial strategy, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government gave us a lesson on sustainability. We were told that unless there were sustainable hubs and gateways, the focus for future development would be lost. He said that we need a counterbalance to Dublin and that unless the centres are sustainable economically and socially, Dublin's problems will continue to get worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">For four years the Minister for Finance would announce from the side of his mouth at various elections that there would be decentralisation. One year followed another but all of a sudden we get the message for 2004. The fact that 11 June is the date for European and local elections never crossed the Minister's mind.</p>

The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism managed to decentralise his Department to Killarney. Everything else will be in the midlands or closer to Dublin. The Government took this decision on a political basis and, like the Milk Rás, it went everywhere. There is nothing wrong with that for those who benefit but I am sorry the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not here because Tom takes responsibility for everything in the midlands.</p>

Ballinasloe got 110. Why do I mention Ballinasloe? I do so because the leader of the Progressive Democrats is from just outside the town and she spent the last ten years telling the people there that she will solve their problems. No other town in Ireland has been ravaged by unemployment like Ballinasloe. We lost 1,100 jobs in five years and we got 110 decentralised jobs out of 10,000.</p>

That is a fact. What type of Government can oversee that sort of spending? If it will not change its ethos and approach on planning for the future of the regions it should at least ring-fence whatever sum it decides to spend in a particular way in a region. The Government did not do so. Its behaviour on the roads projects in the BMW region is a scandal. The Minister for Transport tried to tell me last week that somehow much of the money spent on Heuston Station in Dublin, of which we all approve, was good for the BMW region. It is difficult to understand how that could be.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Last Wednesday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, presented the seventh budget for the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. The budget implements our strategy for economic and social progress in every county, especially the 25 outside Dublin. Despite Deputy Connaughton's concerns, every county was accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The budget has four key objectives: to encourage employment and growth in every region by means of decentralisation, to target tax reform and social support for people on lower incomes, to continue to manage our public finances well and to secure competitiveness by controlling inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">This is a strategic budget, one which will begin to transform the regions. It will be known for many years as the decentralisation budget. It follows the publication of the Government's national spatial strategy last year. It also follows a clear pledge given by the Tánaiste in April last year at the annual conference of the Progressive Democrats in Galway that this would be the year of action on decentralisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">It is a budget which delivers fairness in a new way, not alone in tax reform and social welfare but in where and how Government spending will be distributed across the country, even in Deputy Enright's county.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Government has decided that eight Departments and the Office of Public Works will move their headquarters outside Dublin. As many as 10,000 civil and public servants will be involved. This radical change will offer substantial benefits for the communities to which the Departments will move, for the Departments themselves and for the staff who will be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The Office of Public Works will work from a new office in Trim and will co-ordinate the implementation group to oversee the process. I am pleased that Mr. Phil Flynn has agreed to chair the group. He is an experienced negotiator and his impartiality and fairness are respected by all. He is joined by a team of people with a track record at top management and I am looking forward to working with them in this programme of strategic change for Ireland. I am sure they can also count on the support of this House in getting the job done.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">This radical and reforming budget is only possible because our economic and social strategy has worked for people, for jobs and for our communities. Our main economic objective is to consolidate the gains that have been made in recent years and to build on our future prosperity. The significant gains made by Ireland in recent years are due in large part to the Government's sound budget policies. The proof of these policies is in our achievements. Over the course of the past decade a thriving economic climate has been created in Ireland and we have recorded one of the best economic performances in the world. Employment is up by 50% and about 600,000 more people are at work. From 1997 to 2002 Irish GDP grew by an average of 9% compared to an average of approximately 2.5% in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The fruits of this economic success have been put to good use. Taxes have been cut and the tax system has been reformed. We have invested in public services. Our top three spending areas are social welfare, health and education, in that order. Our public finances have been put on a sound footing. We are increasing spending at a rate we can afford and manage. The general Government debt level has been more than halved from 74% of GDP in 1996 to just 33% in 2003, the second lowest in the European Union. This means public resources can be used for services and investment instead of heavy debt payments. Provision for the future has also been made with the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This budget aims to build on these successes and strengthen the resilience of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Our economy has had to cope with a much more challenging environment over the past 18 months or so. However, we can conservatively expect GDP growth of 2% and GNP growth of 2.5%. These rates of growth are still well above the European average. The European Commission expects EU growth to average just 0.4% this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The economic performance of our country is excellent. It means we have a very sound basis for future social and economic development. Governments and policy makers around Europe now want to learn from Ireland and thousands of people come here for jobs and opportunity. That speaks for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">In recent years inflation has been a cause of concern. However, it has eased significantly this year from a high of 5.1% in February to 2.8% in October, its lowest level in four years. We now expect that it will average 3.5% this year and fall to 2.5% in 2004. This is a very positive development for all our people, including consumers, pensioners, savers and investors. Low inflation is critical for the business environment and competitiveness. This is what creates jobs and wealth and generates the resources needed to build the sort of society we want. We must continue to focus on competitiveness and value for money for our future progress. The more competitive we are the more we will benefit from the international upturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">We are also investing in the future by putting record levels of investment in research and development. We are providing €340 million across enterprise, agriculture, health and education. We have also introduced, this year, a research and development tax credit to encourage private sector research. Our future is based on knowledge and innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">We expect that our economy will respond to the international recovery as it develops so that Irish growth levels will remain significantly above the European average and will return to a trend growth rate of approximately 5% by 2006 if we continue to manage our economy prudently.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The Government is committed to providing public services which are of a high quality and give value for money. Since 1997 there have been real and effective increases in public spending on social welfare, health, education and infrastructure. We will continue to provide substantial funding for these key priority areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">We are committed to pursuing policies which improve social inclusion, protect those most in need, reduce the numbers living in poverty and raise living standards. The budget builds on our work to date and provides substantial funding for the most vulnerable in our society. The improvements announced in the budget provide total social welfare expenditure in 2004 which is €750 million higher than this year. All the social welfare rate increases in this budget are well ahead of projected inflation. The lowest social welfare rates will be increased by more than three times the rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Old age pensions will be increased by €10 a week. This brings the old age contributory pension to €167.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to €154 a week.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">Changes introduced in the budget will remove 41,400 taxpayers from the tax net, of whom 2,500 are aged over 65 years. The employee credit is being increased by €240 per annum, ensuring that 90% of the minimum wage is not taxable.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Minister for Finance has made only minor changes to indirect taxation to keep the rate of inflation under control. The price of a packet of 20 cigarettes will increase by 25 cent and petrol and diesel will increase by 5 cent per litre. These changes will raise €243 million in revenue next year and will add less than 0.4% to the consumer price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">To encourage better use of our agricultural land resource, relief for certain farm leases has been increased. For leases of five to seven years the exemption goes from €5,078 to €7,500 and for leases of more than seven years the exemption will increase from €7,618 to €10,000. The farm organisations have welcomed these changes very warmly.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The scheme of capital allowances for investment in farm pollution control has been extended by a further three years to end in 2006. Income received by Gaeltacht households under the summer student scheme will be exempt from income tax. Such income is already disregarded for social welfare income purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The Government recognises the need for an effective infrastructure network for all parts of Ireland in order to allow us to sustain and encourage investment. Since 1997 the Government has invested over €33 billion with the aim of closing the infrastructure deficit in Ireland. We will continue to prioritise our infrastructure development. In 2004 investment in infrastructure, including roads, rail, schools and hospitals, will rise to €5.6 billion. This is almost 5% of GNP and is double the EU average.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I am please that this infrastructure investment includes the budget's additional €30 million capital for education—</p>

          <p eId="para_254">In this year's decentralisation budget the Government has made a decisive step forward for economic development across all regions. This is a historic budget. It signals an end to the thinking about going up to Dublin and down the country, about the rich east, the poor west and the forgotten midlands. We are putting an end to that and making a start to a balanced, fair and inclusive Ireland, east, west, north, south and the magnificent midlands.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeJacob" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Mr. Jacob</from>
          <p eId="para_255">I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. I thank both colleagues for sharing their time with me. From the perspective of the Government backbenches, I view this budget in a positive light, I laud its thrust and it has my wholehearted support. The economy is emerging from a downturn which has also affected the global economy. I commend the Government for resisting what must have been a great temptation to borrow heavily, particularly as there were those who strongly advocated this course. Happily, it appears that lessons have been learned from the mistakes of the past made by Governments of all hues when this course was embraced with disastrous consequences. The Irish people and Irish taxpayers are still paying through the nose for those mistakes. We would have a wonderful economy today if we did not have to service that debt of yesteryear. The Government is now dealing with it in a more sophisticated and professional fashion and not as in the past, heaping all the take from the PAYE sector into that bottomless pit of borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Decentralisation seems to be the main topic of this budget. Members on all sides of the House have concentrated on this issue. I welcome the proposals for decentralisation. I envisage that it will breathe new life into many towns and communities throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Speakers on the other side of the House, such as Deputy Enright and my good friend, Deputy Connaughton, have welcomed this proposal. Deputy Connaughton stated he has spent a lifetime striving for decentralisation, as indeed have many of us in this House. Year after year during debates such as this I have advocated progress towards decentralisation because of the merits it can and will bring to the country. It is a logical and meritorious issue and I am pleased it is being done. In my wildest dreams I never thought that such a large step would be taken on the issue. The scale is very encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">All Members of the House should take a bow with regard to decentralisation. We all have our own drums to bang but I do not think it should be the subject of adversarial comment. For instance, in my constituency of Wicklow, the public representatives met as a group on a regular basis. At that time I was the senior political figure in the constituency because I was a Minister of State. I sat around the table with a Fine Gael councillor, Mr. George Jones. We worked together to make a presentation to Government. It was a superb presentation which displayed the wares of Wicklow, its towns and communities. The chambers of commerce and my colleagues from this House, such as Deputy McManus, now deputy leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Timmins and those of my own ilk, were all together at the same table. We produced what we regarded as a very meritorious application for an allocation to Wicklow. We were successful and we did it together.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Speaking as a Deputy for Wicklow I am somewhat disappointed at the scale of the allocation which it received. Deputy Connaughton spoke about his town of Ballinasloe being run down. He claimed it was perhaps one of the worst towns in Ireland. I suggest that he come to Wicklow and visit Arklow. In the past it was a thriving town but with the run-down of traditional industries it became the worst or one of the worst towns in Ireland, economically speaking.</p>

          <from>Mr. Jacob</from>
          <p eId="para_261">Thousands of jobs were gone in one fell swoop with the run-down of those traditional industries. I welcome decentralisation but the scale of County Wicklow and its large population warrant something more than those 140 new personnel. They will be greatly welcomed to south Wicklow but there are other areas of the county requiring attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">In his contribution yesterday, the Taoiseach spoke about decentralisation as did all the other speakers. He stated it would be an ongoing policy for the placing of future Government offices or services. He said that even in the present round, not all of the locations have yet been decided upon. I will rely on the statements by my party leader, the Taoiseach, that there is more to come. I ask him to bear in mind my comments and my appeal to further consider the requirements of County Wicklow with its scale and its large population. There is a downside to its situation on the immediate periphery of Dublin and it could do with further benefits from this programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and Mr. David Begg speaking on the radio this morning. They were discussing economic prosperity and social justice. I suppose everybody expected blood and an adversarial battle between those gentlemen who in their particular fields do an excellent job for the country. That did not happen and they spoke about the appreciation for the employment that has been created over the last number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Taoiseach in his contribution to this debate stated that schools were as important as roads in infrastructural requirements and progress. There are many schools in my constituency screaming for attention such as St. Saviour's Church of Ireland national school in Rathdrum, Lacken national school and Hollywood national school. The mother of all mistakes has been made in Avondale community college which is situated in my home town. I have had an excellent response on that matter from the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I am confident he will address and correct that <i>faux pas</i> in the short-term.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I wish to share my time with Deputy Gilmore. Having listening to Deputy Jacob's contribution I suspect that were he still a Minister, Wicklow might have figured more prominently in the budget, particularly concerning the schools' programme, but that is the way of politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">It is a pity the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has left the Chamber because I want to make a few comments on what he said. His political vision needs to be scrutinised somewhat. He has a rather schoolboy style of debate and when one strips away the trimmings, all that is left is the rhetoric of a traditional class warrior.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_268">This is a Minister who defends privilege and wealth. He is quite happy to tolerate and promote the idea of a heavy new form of levy on young house buyers, while at the same fighting tooth and nail to prevent a wealth tax. That is the reality of his position.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The budget, promoted by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, is about defending the super wealthy and providing tax breaks the wealthy can avail of, while others cannot. The budget is about middle income families struggling to pay for education to ensure their children have a good start in life so they can deal with the rising cost of living. That reality has not been addressed in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Minister has been quick to rewrite history but during the time of the rainbow Government there was a record level of house building. More importantly, however, people could afford to buy the houses being built because the balance between income and the cost of housing was reasonable. During the period of office of the Fianna Fáil-PD Government that balance has gone totally awry. The relationship between income and the cost of housing is completely out of kilter, to the point where many people are either getting into enormous debt or have great difficulty getting a foothold on the property ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The other legacy of the rainbow Government was its contribution to combating crime. It is important to point this out, particularly as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not mention crime in his speech.</p>

Where are the great achievements, such as the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau for which the rainbow Government was responsible? Where are the Minister's great initiatives? He is battling with the Garda Síochána and the prison officers but, meanwhile, gangs are killing each other in the streets and creating a dangerous environment for the rest of us.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">The Minister says he is only interested in jobs and claims that his Government has generated all the new jobs in recent years, but that is childish rubbish. Everybody knows that the jobs have not arisen as a result of something that happened in the last couple of years because the Government played around with the tax bands. This is about serious deep-rooted investment in education that goes way back. It is about EU transfers of large amounts of money to this country. It is about partnership where workers made sacrifices and reached agreements for the benefit of the entire community. Let us get real, therefore, and stop telling little stories that do not tie in with reality. It is a sign of the bankruptcy of the Progressive Democrats that we have this kind of flim-flam, while at the same time the Progressive Democrats are shoring up the so-called decentralisation plan, which is the greatest example of pork barrel politics we have seen in years.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Some 71,000 workers are now being brought into the higher rate of tax. Is that PD policy? Is that what they want to see in Ireland? I thought the Progressive Democrats were the low tax party. They are the low tax party for very rich people, which is essentially the impact of what they are doing. The fact that the budget has been overshadowed by the decentralisation programme does not mean it will not have a negative effect. Some 71,000 extra people will come into the higher tax rate, while mothers are wondering what they did to deserve an increase of only 20 cent per day in child benefit. What is it for? What can one buy for 20 cent? A lollipop perhaps. People are more interested in these sums when they come to assess the budget than the Government's grandiose decentralisation scheme, which is a minor distraction in most people's lives. Decentralisation is a fig-leaf to cover the embarrassing deficiencies in the budget, as well as being designed to create a benign context for next year's local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">It is worth repeating that the plan does not involve decentralisation at all. It is a scatter-gun dispersal of offices around the country, if it ever happens, which is hugely debatable. It is being done by a Government that has abolished real decentralisation through the health board structures, where there was accountability and decision making at local level. Flawed as the health board system was, it at least provided for local decision making, yet the Government has no compunction about abolishing the entire structure instead of reforming it. The Government is thus centralising the decision-making process that operated hitherto on a local basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The decentralisation plan has been driven by political rather than planning considerations. No impact assessment has been undertaken to inform us whether or not it will produce better Government or whether it will create a further fragmentation of services. Nor will the Minister for Finance tell us how he can reconcile his ambition to decentralise with the free choice of thousands of civil servants. He cannot do so because he has never bothered to find out what approach these civil servants, both senior and junior, would take to any such dislocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I am concerned that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, did not put on the record his approach to State property. Nothing has been said about the cost of long leases the Government is already tied into concerning State properties, or about such properties that are part of our historical architectural inheritance. The Minister of State should have been able to tell the House that he is not going to sell the Custom House, contrary to what has been floated in the media. It would be a disaster if that kind of architecturally important building fell into the clutches of commercial interests. That is the kind of thinking the Progressive Democrats have been promoting for a long time. While my fear may be groundless, it would be important for the Minister of State to make that commitment in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Health matters are of great concern to people but the budget has done nothing to alleviate their concerns. The most disgraceful of all the broken promises of this Government, and there are many, is the cold-blooded decision to refuse to increase the number of medical cards to those on low incomes. A specific commitment to provide 200,000 new medical cards was given by Fianna Fáil, while in its healthy strategy the Government promised to increase income limits for eligibility, but neither promise has been kept. The Government's record is truly shameful. Excluding the better off over-70s, the number of people with medical card cover is the lowest ever since the scheme was instituted in 1972. At 27.7% of the total population, it is a stark and telling figure. At a time when the country's finances were significantly restricted, approximately 38% of the population had medical card cover. The Government could have increased that, without any difficulty, to 40% of the population but it chose not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I ask that a commitment be given in the House that where incomes go over the limit because of an increase in the basic minimum wage or in social welfare payment, people will not lose their vital medical cards. These people are on low incomes. For them, the cost of attending a general practitioner, which is €40 or even €45, is the same as it is for those on high incomes. The cost of the community drug scheme has increased to €78. These people are trapped in an out of date and cruel level of income eligibility which dictates that a married couple cannot get a medical card if their combined income is over €200 per week. A single person under 66 years of age is over the limit once his or her income goes over €138. People cannot look after their health in those circumstances. I would like to see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform manage a family on that kind of low income and deal with medical bills. That would be a real and new experience which might enlighten him somewhat when he comes in here and patronises the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The people who cannot afford to see their doctor either get better, which does happen sometimes, or, more often, become unnecessarily seriously ill and end up in accident and emergency departments. That puts greater pressure on an already pressurised emergency service.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">At the Joint Committee on Health and Children I requested the Minister for Health and Children to correct the record after his Minister of State, Deputy Callely, made grossly misleading statements on radio the other night and I do so again because it has not been corrected. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, stated that eligibility levels for a medical card are the responsibility of the chief executive officers in health boards. That is mischievous nonsense. It is also dangerous nonsense because it shows the length to which the Government is willing to go to avoid bearing its responsibilities and living up to its commitments. We teach our children to tell the truth yet, increasingly, the truth is being bowdlerised by this Government. Ministers do not care about accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Before the general election we had a health strategy which promised a great deal but what did it deliver? It delivered a general election. That was the net effect of the health strategy. Since then we have had three new reports, Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly, which referred to fundamental changes, the abolition of health boards, the institution of new bodies to manage the health service, a doubling of the number of hospital consultants, a greatly enhanced ambulance service, highly developed primary care, hundreds of acute beds and their replacement, and the resourcing of the hospital service, none of which has been costed or measured.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">We often talk in health care about evidence-based medicine. It is important to base any comment on the Government's spin on evidence, and the evidence is very clear. The budget is telling a totally different story to the story being told by the Minister for Health and Children. The multiannual part of the investment programme makes sense but the figures published for capital investment simply do not add up if we are talking about a health reform programme as outlined by the Minister for Health and Children. There is no additional funding to implement the recommendations in the Hanly report. That is the clear message coming from the Estimates and the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I will briefly refer to the figures for the next five years. We are not just talking about next year but over a period of time. In 2003, the capital investment in our health service was €514 million. In 2004, that figure will not be increased but will be cut to €509 million. Direct Exchequer capital funding will reduce further to €475 million. In fact, over the five-year framework enunciated in the budget, the average increase in capital health spending by the Exchequer will be 0.5%. That is the true nature of health reform. What we are talking about in reality are cutbacks, not investment, as we have seen them in terms of hospital bed closures and difficulties experienced by people in getting access to health care. That is a tragedy because for so long money has been available to do the right thing in the health service yet the possibilities were not availed of. Instead we have this smug, small vision from the Progressive Democrats which appears to be driving this Government in a direction where it concentrates solely on jobs, as if economic prosperity and social justice were somehow incompatible. They are not. What we do know is that when the economy is good and there is an equal society, we also have a healthy people.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">In the context of the budget it would be interesting to hear from the Minister why there is not a penny for the provision of the 2,000 additional gardaí promised during the election and which are needed to provide safety and security for people and for which he is directly responsible.

          <p eId="para_292">I received a letter from a constituent who tells me that she is an out-patient at a liver unit in one of the hospitals and that she was sent to her dietician earlier this year for the management of a severe food intolerance with an associated bowel disorder. Arising from that, she was put on special diets because of her intolerance of lactose and a variety of other foods. She gets a dietary allowance of €74 per week. She is on an income of €132.50 per week disability allowance. This woman is a victim of the cutbacks introduced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. She is one of many who are facing the loss of the dietary allowance and many more like her who will be prescribed such allowances in the future. People who are renting, for example, and who have been in their accommodation less than six months, are facing the prospect of not getting a rent allowance. Unemployed people will not be able to go back to education. People who lose their jobs will see their unemployment benefit cut by 11 weeks because they have only four years' social insurance contributions. For every one of the 16 cuts made by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, there are real people who are suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I expected to hear in the budget that there would be a reversal of the €58 million in cuts made by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, or at least some adjustment to them. I also expected to hear some proposals to provide for the community employment schemes which are so important to disadvantaged areas. Unfortunately, there was no such announcement in this budget nor was there any additional money for homelessness or special needs education. There was not much joy in it either for taxpayers because 73,000 additional taxpayers who are now on the 20% band will go into the 42% band. Ministers and Deputies on the other side of the House who constantly tell us that this budget favours the less well-off should explain to this House why, when tax and PRSI are taken into consideration, somebody now on the average industrial earnings will pay tax and PRSI at 48% but somebody on three or four times the average industrial earnings will pay tax and PRSI combined at a rate of only 44%. They might also explain how those people will deal with the hidden taxes that are implicit in this budget, such as the increase in local authority service charges. These charges will inevitably rise because of the Government's failure to provide adequately for the benchmarking awards which must be paid by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Much has been made of the €30 million provided on a once-off basis in the budget for the local government fund. When inflation is taken into account, this additional sum will still leave the local authorities €90 million short of what is required to meet their benchmarking commitments. This will inevitably mean higher commercial rates and local service charges, which are regressive stealth charges on people who can ill afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">To cover up for this lazy budget and provide some cheer for the demoralised Government backbenchers, the Minister for Finance announced on budget day a grand plan for decentralisation. These proposals are a test of the gullibility of the people. The people of the 53 towns selected for promises of Government offices and decentralised civil servants need to ask themselves why they should believe this promise from the same people who lied to them before the general election about school extensions, 2,000 additional gardaí and 200,000 additional medical cards. I listened to a representative of one of the chambers of commerce, when asked this question on television on budget night, make the point that the promise could be believed because it was in the budget speech. I remind him that the same Minister who delivered the budget speech explained away the promises made in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto in mid-2002. After the election he told us that if we had read the small print of the manifesto, we would have realised that the promises were all conditional on economic performance and availability of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">What, therefore, does the small print of the budget tell us about decentralisation? It tells us a story quite different from the press releases now being issued by Government Deputies to local newspapers and radio stations. In the budget speech, we were informed that the full details of decentralisation were in the budget summary. Turning to the summary, we find three facts regarding the details of decentralisation. First, the status of the plan is described as just a proposal. Second, responsibility for implementation is being given to an implementation committee, which will mean, for example, that when a town finds that the promised decentralised office and staff are not materialising and asks where they are, it will be referred to the hapless chairman of the decentralisation committee, Mr. Phil Flynn, which is being set up to take the blame. Third, we are told the Government may make adjustments to the detailed provisions below, where necessary, to ensure continued effective delivery of public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">All this is in addition to the requirement that decentralisation must be voluntary. We all know that many civil servants would happily volunteer to move out of Dublin but it is stretching credibility to believe that the staff of an entire Department, including all its professional and Department specific personnel, will volunteer to move out of the city to the town selected for them. Many of the towns being given the big promise will eventually be told "Sorry, but they would not volunteer."</p>
          <p eId="para_298">In his budget speech, the Minister proclaimed "the locations which have been selected take full account of the national spatial strategy." Here, he is wrong again as only a quarter of the proposed decentralised jobs are to go to the hubs and gateways identified in the strategy and some of the towns already promised decentralisation will get nothing. These are Letterkenny, Ballina, Castlebar, Tuam, Galway, Ennis, Tralee, Cork, Waterford and Dundalk. The proposed decentralisation is the big promise for the local and European elections in June and any town or county which believes it deserves the disappointment it will eventually suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">In today's newspapers we read that the line Ministers and civil servants in the Departments affected were only told about the plan 48 hours before the budget. If this is true, the decentralisation proposals are not serious or thought-out. If they were serious, the Minister for Finance would be able to tell us a few things about them. He informed us in his budget speech that the proposals were first flagged in budget 2000. If that is the case, discussions with the Departments affected must have taken place during the past three years, not only the past 48 hours. The Minister should be in a position, therefore, to tell us something about these discussions, for example, the reason the Minister for Defence was able to inform the House on 4 November that there were no further decentralisation plans for his Department, yet on budget day we were informed that the entire Department of Defence will be decentralised to a number of towns in County Kildare.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">How were the eight Departments selected for decentralisation and what criteria were used? Why were these particular Departments found guilty of what was referred to as the Dublin mindset, for which decentralisation is the rehabilitation? Why are the Departments headed by the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the President of the Progressive Democrats Party and the two powerful Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Health and Children, the heirs apparent, not on the transfer list? Will we now have two-tier Government in which a premier division of powerful Departments, coincidentally headed by the politically most powerful Ministers, is based in Dublin, while all the other Departments are scattered to the 53 centres selected? How will the decentralised Departments compete for resources and attention with the top level Departments which will remain within the Dublin 2 loop?</p>
          <p eId="para_302">How were the towns selected? What criteria were used and alternatives considered and why were most of the national spatial strategy towns excluded? How were sections of Departments selected for allocation to specific towns? Why, for example, in a country with a longer coastline than France was it decided to locate the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in an inland town which could not be further from the sea? What consideration was given to the consumers of departmental services? For example, when representatives of a group water scheme in the west want to talk to officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, they can now simply take a train to Dublin, but if the proposals are implemented they will have to take a train to Heuston Station, a bus to Connolly Station and another train to Wexford.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">The location of the Government offices will obviously deliver economic benefits to the towns concerned, but what assessment has been made of the implications of the removal of the jobs in question from Dublin? Assuming many of the partners of the 10,000 civil servants involved are also in the workforce, it is probable that 15,000 jobs will move out of the capital. In addition, the services and suppliers of the Departments affected will also have to move. What economic impact assessment was made of this decision?</p>

          <p eId="para_307">How will the jobs being moved out of Dublin be replaced? For example, is it intended – there appears to be a hint of this in the budget – that they will be replaced by high value-added jobs in companies that will benefit from the proposed new tax measure exempting the disposal of subsidiary companies from capital gains tax, which is intended to enable Ireland to compete internationally for headquarters and holding companies? Is it intended, therefore, that the public servants will move out of Dublin to make way for high value-added international companies which will come here to replace them? If that is the case, are the provincial towns concerned being sold a big pup, namely, the emphasis and direction of encouragement for inward investment will be focused on attracting high value-added companies to locate in Dublin? I assume some assessment has been made of the economic implications for Dublin of the decentralisation proposal and I would like it on record and explained to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">This proposal does not involve real decentralisation because the political and administrative structures it has been proposed to decentralise will remain as centralised as ever. Real decentralisation involves the devolution of functions to local and regional authorities, as happens in many other countries in Europe and elsewhere. This is not the case with the current proposal. The Government, if it is serious, is proposing to retain the highly centralised governmental structures, while simply scattering them to various parts of the country. That conclusion could leave the country, whatever about the individual towns and counties concerned, worse off in a situation where the Government, which sometimes leaves us wondering about how joined up it is, is less joined up.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">We will return to these matters during Question Time and other debates in this House. It will be interesting to hear how the Government intends to proceed in practical terms with a decentralisation proposal which it seems to have dreamed up off the top of its head to provide cover for a bad budget.</p>

Unemployment at 4.5 % is less than a quarter of what it was when Fine Gael was in Government in the 1980s. GDP growth is down to 2.5% this year from 9% in recent years, but key economic forecasts suggest it will increase by up to 5% next year and remain close to 6% over the coming years. Interest rates are at their lowest level in the modern era. The House may remember that interest rates under the Fine Gael led Government were at 23%.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">It caused increasing unemployment and it was accompanied by a national feeling of doom and gloom that was fed by further borrowing to pay an increasing number of unemployment benefit recipients. The country was enveloped in a sense of paralysis, helplessness and depression. Income was taxed at an unbelievable 65%, in addition to three 1% levies. When the levies were taken into account, they brought the then standard income tax rate of 35% up almost to today's highest rate of 42%. In those dark days corporation tax was 50% compared to 12.5% today. In other words, we were taxed out of existence by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government to enable useless day to day spending which did not show any return. Those appalling economic policies pushed the national debt to 125% of GNP compared to 35% today. Some 50,000 people left the country in despair each year and almost one fifth of the workforce was on the dole. It is no wonder Fine Gael is the party of depression.</p>

          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_378">The Deputy is baying. It is about time he listened. On agriculture, my Department's responsibility, I am glad to see that the Central Statistics Office has announced today that aggregate farm income has increased by 2% this year. Direct payments continue to be an important component of incomes, amounting to more than €1.6 billion in 2003 or an average of €13,000 per farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Some farm specific tax measures have been enhanced in the budget and these will benefit the farming sector to the tune of €21 million or about 1% of aggregate farm income. A significant provision has been made in the budget for 2004 to encourage the leasing of land on a long-term basis. From 1 January next, the current income tax exemption for land leased out by farmers aged over 55 years on a long-term lease to unconnected persons is being extended to farmers aged over 40 years. The rental income exemption limits for this relief are also being raised from €7,618.43 to €10,000 for leases of seven years or more and from €5,079 to €7,500 for leases of five to seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">This amendment will help improve land mobility which is central to the Government's strategy of developing a core of commercial full-time farms. At present, 19% of agricultural land is leased but mostly on a short-term basis, and land sales are at their lowest levels at less than 0.2% of agricultural areas. The improved income tax exemption should help free more land and make it available on a long-term basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">An increase in the supply of land should facilitate better long-term planning by farmers who may be required to scale up production at a reasonable cost. Concerns have been expressed that decoupling and the linking of the single farm payment to the area farmed in 2000 to 2002 may result in rigidities in land movement at a time when the availability of land will be critical for those who wish to remain in full-time farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The provision is estimated to be worth €13 million in a full year. The Government's commitment is underlined by the high level of public expenditure. The gross provision in the Abridged Estimates of €1.39 billion is an increase of 5% over 2003. In addition to this, my Department is also responsible for a further €1.6 billion of EU-funded agricultural measures, bringing total expenditure to just less than €3 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Following decoupling, farmers will be free to focus more sharply on the market and the demands of the final consumer. Any incentives to maintain livestock which do not make a viable return from the marketplace will be eliminated, and the burdens associated with compliance, with a myriad of schemes involving various application dates and retention periods, will also be reduced. This provides a better basis for a competitive agriculture and food industry than a system that required farmers to base decisions on eligibility for premium.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Great strides have been made this year in securing the future of agriculture. We have laid the basis for a simplified Common Agricultural Policy with a financial framework agreed until well into the next decade. Cushioned by single farm payments, farmers will now be able to direct their attention to the market to enhance their incomes. Our agri-food sector, in turn, must respond to this more market related approach and embrace the new system. I have no doubt or hesitation in commending the budget to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">I will demonstrate the Government's commitment to a comprehensive range of services for older people by outlining the resources made available to my Department in recent years. Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from €12.7 million in 1997 to €87 million in 2002. More than €270 million in additional funding has been provided for services for older people from 1997 to the present. This has resulted in the recruitment of 1,000 additional staff. Between 1998 and 2001 more than 550 additional beds have been provided in new community nursing units and more than 1,250 day places have been provided in new day care centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">A root and branch review of the nursing home subvention scheme is under way in my Department and is considering all aspects of the scheme, including the allowances given for assets, assessment procedures for means and dependency and all other elements of the scheme. My Department is also in the process of consulting all stakeholders with an interest in the scheme to hear their views on how it might be improved to benefit the most important person involved, the patient. I invite Members to participate in this. It is planned to bring forward proposals for additional measures that may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report together with the experience gained from the operation of the scheme. The review of the scheme must also be considered in the wider context of how we as a society will fund long-term care in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">It is acknowledged that there is insufficient provision of public long-term care beds to cater for our growing elderly population, with a resulting over-reliance on the public nursing home sector. This was acknowledged when my Department was preparing the national health strategy, and there is a commitment in the strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds as well as 600 additional day hospital beds. In addition, the strategy proposes the provision of another 800 extended care beds per year over a seven year period.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">This group is taking a cross-cutting approach to its work, with members speaking with authority on behalf of their Departments and having influence on their Department's policies on services for older people. The interdepartmental group also decided that the Department of Health and Children might take on the development of the equality strategy, incorporating all groups, including older people, and it was agreed that a number of strategy documents might be drawn together to satisfy the equality agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Significant progress has been made and I am committed to the continuous development of our services through innovative and creative measures such as I have mentioned. My commitment to older people cannot be denied. It is through the efforts of previous generations that our economy and society are as healthy as they are today. Our success has been achieved by standing on the shoulders of giants and it is only right that older people are afforded the required supports for living in the dignity to which their immense contribution to our country's development entitles them.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I welcome and take some credit for the first step in establishing the principles for public service pensions.

          <p eId="para_457">Social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost €630 million in a full year, a substantial increase of €100 million on last year's budget package. This should correct the misrepresentation that has been peddled about social welfare cutbacks. In the budget for 2004, the personal rate of disability unemployment benefit is increased by €10 to €134.80. Other key positive aspects of the budget include an increase of €28 per week in family income supplement thresholds, a €7 increase in the minimum payment, an increase of €835 per annum in the respite care grant from June 2004, and an increase in the widowed parent grant to €2,700 from budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">All our budgets since 1997 have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of older people in society when it comes to pensions. Since the large increases of the early 1980s, their relative position had fallen back and they needed a sustained boost to lift them above the poverty level once again. Before the 1997 election we promised that, in Government, we would increase all old age pensions to at least €127 per week over our term. We delivered on that commitment and provided even more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Before the 2002 election we promised to increase the State pension to €200 per week. The budget for 2004 puts us well on track to delivering this commitment. It provides for a €10 per week increase in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">The number of social welfare recipients under the Minister's budgets now stands at a significant 975,000. In monetary terms the statistics are even more stark. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil is that the rate of old age contributory pension will now stand at €167.30 per week. Other pensions, for example, the over-66 widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit, increased by €11.50 per week. In the budget for 2004, all other personal weekly rates increased by €10 per week. This benefits almost 1 million people who claim a weekly social welfare payment or 1.5 million when their dependants are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I am happy that this substantial increase will apply in full to more than 400,000 people on the lower rate of weekly social welfare payment. The increase is more than three times the expected rate of inflation. The payments affected include unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and allowance, pre-retirement allowance, one-parent family payments, carer's benefit allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Government is committed to making substantial improvements in the income position of those on the lower social welfare rates in line with our policy, under Sustaining Progress, of achieving the income adequacy targets under the national anti-poverty strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Building on the massive increases we have devoted to child benefit, this year we are announcing an additional €80 in the full year to increase further this vital support. Child benefit rates will increase by €6 per month for the first and second child and by €8 per month for the third and subsequent children. Mick Jagger, I suppose, will be applying.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">To appreciate the scale of child benefit increases under this Administration, it is worth emphasising that when we returned to Government in June 1997 child benefit was payable at the rate of €38.09 per month for the first and second children and €49.52 for the third and subsequent children. The increases and the greater priority Fianna Fáil has attached to child benefit mean that, following budget 2004, child benefit will be paid at the rate of €131.60 for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third and subsequent children. The rate of child benefit payment has increased by 3.5 times the figure it was on the day we first took office.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_468">I wish to share time with Deputies Gogarty, Cuffe, Connolly and McGrath. I want to refer to the Taoiseach's claim that the budget and the Government are not right wing and that they are acting in the interests of the less well off. I presume when the Taoiseach says the Government is not right wing – whatever about Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats are not known for sitting on the fence in the centre – he must believe it is left wing. My understanding of a left wing budget is one that seeks to redistribute wealth with the objective of creating a fairer and more equal society. This seems to be at odds with the fact that the last six budgets of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy have left us with the most unequal society in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">When I examined this week's budget I could not find any evidence of a radical left wing redistributive element, or any strategies to tackle the major inequities of our two-tier health and education system or the concentrated urban alienation and deprivation that produces the crime and drug problems that cause so much public concern. No strategy exists, even to bring Ireland's standard of social provision in education, health care and social welfare up to average European Union levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I felt that perhaps I was missing something, so I looked at an objective analysis of the budget by an apolitical group. I refer to the CORI justice commission's analysis and critique. It suggests that the Minister's budgetary approach will ultimately fail to address social exclusion. It points out, for example, that the Minister for Finance's claim that job creation is the appropriate goal if real social inclusion is to be achieved fails to recognise that almost 60% of those living in poverty are in households headed by persons outside the labour force. These people are retired, ill, have a disability that keeps them out of the labour market or they are on home duties. As they are not in a position to take up a job, the Minister's response to their situation adds insult to injury. CORI goes on to state that the poorest people have again been told to wait and that Ireland has the widest rich-poor gap of any country in the European Union. We should be ashamed.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">CORI argues that if this Government's approach continues, this will be an even more deeply divided two-tier society. This situation, it says, is unjust, unfair, unacceptable and unsustainable. While Ireland's <i>per capita</i> income is now one of the highest in the EU, the country's infrastructure and social provision are far below the Union's average. Our unequal income distribution, growing rich-poor gap and under-equipped health and education systems represent the most visible signs of the extensive gaps in social provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The insufficient supply of social housing and the problems with public transport impact on poor people every day. In the context of continued economic growth, the opportunity to address these deficits remains available, but CORI argues that this Government has chosen not to avail of this opportunity. CORI says that the necessary money could be raised, not through income tax increases but by the elimination of tax shelters and tax handouts to the wealthiest in our society – as Deputy Joe Higgins put it yesterday in the House, the tax exiles, the stud farm owners, the property developers and the super-rich rock stars, among others. CORI concludes that ultimately the Government's choices in budget 2004 were based on its vision for the future, which maintains a deeply divided two-tier society in a period when we have the opportunity and the resources to provide for meaningful work, relevant education, essential health care and appropriate accommodation for everyone, where all can participate in shaping the decisions that affect them and where everyone's culture is respected and the environment protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The resources exist to build such a society but CORI maintains budget 2004 shows once again that the political will is missing. It seems to me that if a left wing budget is redistributive in nature with the objective of achieving a fairer more equal society, then this budget has failed miserably to even point in that direction. I have to conclude that either myself or the Taoiseach does not know the difference between right and left. No strategy is set out in this budget to tackle the inequity that leaves patients lying on trolleys in hospital corridors or that has thousands of children unable to achieve even a basic second level education. There is no strategy to tackle the alienation and deprivation of the urban wastelands where crime gangs rule. There is no attempt in this budget to ensure that the richest in our society should pay more towards providing sustainable social provision. There appears to be some sort of warped manoeuvre in the so-called savage 16 social welfare cuts to hurt the least well off even more.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">That is not to mention the undermining of community structures in areas of disadvantage built up by community employment schemes, job initiatives and the social economy programme. Some 5,000 part-time jobs in community employment have been cut this year and 400 full-time job initiative posts. Even the supposedly ring-fenced community employment drug-related projects have been reduced from the commitment of 1,000 places to the current level of 822. Interestingly, the community employment cuts are disproportionately greater in the Dublin area which contains the largest concentrations of deprivation.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">While I generally welcome the new rural social scheme, I notice that it is to be funded from the dormant accounts fund. I sincerely hope this will not mean any diminution in the priorities set out for that fund's disbursement board, namely educational disadvantage, persons with disabilities and economic and social disadvantage. Great expectations have been built up for this relatively small fund. I trust they will not be dashed yet again as they were in the RAPID debacle.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Leaving aside the decentralisation scam, probably the most cynical element in the budget is the €30 million to local authorities in a once-off grant to help keep the show on the road, to avoid temporarily the massive increases in local charges until after the local elections on 11 June.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">I am pleased to present to the House the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003. The Bill gives effect to the provisions of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and will, when enacted, replace, as and from 1 January 2004, the existing arrangements between Ireland and other member states of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Before I come to the provisions of the Bill, it is appropriate to look at the background to the adoption of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, a copy of which is attached to the Schedule to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">One of the key objectives of the European Union is the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. The European Union is built on democratic principles and the rule of law. It is characterised by the free movement of persons, capital, goods and services. The citizens of the member states have benefited enormously from the opportunities created and from the removal of the barriers to the movement of people and services. However, these same freedoms and opportunities need protection from those who would abuse them in order to evade justice. The reforms introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the additional impetus given by the 1999 Tampere European Council highlighted the importance of developing within the justice and home affairs area measures that protect the Union and member states against such violations. The framework decision on the European arrest warrant owes its origins in particular to the Tampere European Council. The Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition which, in its view, should become the cornerstone of judicial co-operation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union. I stress this because the alternative strategy was uniformity and harmonisation right across the board. A strategic decision was made at Tampere in favour of the principle of mutual recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">It also recognised the need for extradition arrangements that would support and reflect the shared values of the member states and protect their citizens from the scourge of cross-border crime. The framework decision is, therefore, a practical expression of the desire of member states to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of extradition arrangements in a way that reflects the unique relationships that form the basis of the Union. While it follows earlier initiatives, in particular the 1995 and 1996 EU conventions on extradition, it is, as we will see, more radical and far-reaching in its approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">As mentioned earlier, the framework decision on the European arrest warrant will replace the existing extradition arrangements among member states of the EU. The existing arrangements are, in the majority of cases, based on the Council of Europe's 1957 European Convention on Extradition. Although all the member states are parties to the 1957 convention, the extradition arrangements in place reflect certain variations based on historical and other factors. Such variations can be found in the arrangements in place in the case of the Nordic and Benelux states as well as between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I will outline some of the main characteristics of the framework decision and the way in which it differs from the existing arrangements. However, as an overall comment on the framework decision, it is important to bear in mind at all times that it represents a careful balance between, on the one hand, the need for a more efficient system of extradition and surrender of persons who have been convicted or who are being sought for prosecution and, on the other, the provision of safeguards to protect the rights of the individuals concerned. With that in mind, I will first highlight the major new features and then the safeguards that will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Historically, extradition has been regarded as an aspect of a state's exercise of its sovereignty. As a result, extradition arrangements entailed a significant role for the executive arm of the state in question. The framework decision replaces in large measure the interstate aspects of extradition by a system of surrender based on recognition by the judicial authorities of one member state of orders issued by the judicial authorities in another member state for the arrest and surrender of wanted persons. In future, the role of the executive agencies of the state will be to provide administrative and technical support for this intercourt system. This will be done through the central authority in the state. In Ireland, the central authority will be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his or her Department. Therefore, the new system can, to a significant extent, be described as an intercourt system.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The current extradition arrangements have been regularly criticised for being slow, often taking several years to complete. The framework decision addresses these concerns by the introduction of timeframes for the taking of decisions on European arrest warrants. It is proposed that a decision on whether or not to surrender a person should normally be taken within 60 days of the person's arrest, or within a further 30 days where the initial period cannot be met. These timeframes are reflected in the present Bill. However, I stress that they are timeframes, not time limits. By this I mean they are indicative rather than prescriptive. This is the case because, under the doctrine of separation of powers that applies, for instance, in Ireland, it would be inappropriate for the Executive or the Oireachtas to seek to limit the exercise of judicial discretion through the imposition of strict time limits when dealing with cases before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Traditionally, many states refused to extradite their own nationals and considered certain offences as being non-extraditable. The framework decision does not provide for exceptions based on, for example, categories of either offences or offenders. Therefore, there are no provisions permitting refusal to surrender on the grounds that the person being sought is a national of the executing member state or that the offence falls into a particular category of offences, such as revenue or political offences. This is a reasonable approach when we recall that we are dealing in this context with close allies who share our democratic values and respect for the rule of law. Ireland never had difficulty in principle with the extradition of our nationals, provided only that the arrangements were reciprocal. We have over many years greatly curtailed the political offence exception and we changed our law in 2001 to permit extradition for revenue offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The last, but by no means the least, of the major changes I want to highlight relates to the dual criminality requirement. This is the requirement which provides that a person may be extradited to face prosecution or service of a sentence in another state only where the offences concerned are offences under the laws of both the issuing and executing states. The framework decision introduces a significant curtailment of this requirement. Under the arrangements now being introduced by the framework decision and by this Bill, surrender may be sought for offences carrying a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or more, provided the alleged offence corresponds to an offence under the law of the executing member state. In other words, the dual criminality requirement still generally applies. However, the framework decision also provides that where the alleged offence comes within any of the 32 categories of major offences listed in Article 2.2 of the framework decision, and it is an offence that carries a penalty of three years imprisonment or more under the law of the issuing member state, the position under the law of the executing member state does not arise for consideration by the executing court. In other words, the dual criminality requirement is dropped in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">This element of the framework decision presented some difficulty for several member states, including Ireland. It represents a significant departure from current law and practice. However, on examination of the list of offences in Article 2.2 – it is generally referred to as the "positive list"– one will find that, leaving aside the way they are described, all of them are already regarded as serious offences under Irish law. Therefore, since they are already serious offences under our law, dropping the dual criminality requirement in these cases is not as critical as might appear at first glance. While the exact description of one of these cases may not be the same in France as in Ireland, the substance of the offence and the categories set out in the positive list are offences in Irish law. This does not cause us any major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I would like at this stage to draw the attention of Deputies to the safeguards in the Bill. These are designed to protect the rights of the arrested person. Most of them are to be found in the framework decision itself and are repeated in the Bill. I will also be drawing attention to the additional safeguards arising from the statement made by Ireland when the framework decision was being adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Dealing first with the provisions of the framework decision, it sets out general principles on which the safeguard provisions are based. In addition, it contains specific provisions that list mandatory and discretionary grounds upon which requests for surrender can be refused. It also lists guarantees that may be sought before a person is handed over.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">On the general principles, recital 12 affirms that the framework decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Article 6 states, <i>inter alia:</i>“the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms”, the ECHR. Article 1.3 of the framework decision also refers to article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and provides: “the Framework Decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligations to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union”.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Recital 12 goes on to state: "nothing in this Framework Decision may be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to surrender a person for whom a European arrest warrant has been issued when there are reasons to believe, on the basis of objective elements, that the said arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds of his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons." Recital 12 adds that the framework decision "does not prevent a Member State from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media."</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Recital 13 is also important. It states: "no person shall be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." Section 29 reflects the provisions in article 1.3 and recitals 12 and 13.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In regard to the specific protections and guarantees, article 3 of the framework decision lists mandatory grounds for the non-execution of European arrest warrants. A person may not be surrendered if he or she has been the subject of an amnesty in respect of the offence in question. A person who has been finally judged and has completed a sentence imposed in a member state or is no longer required to serve it in respect of the offences in question may not be surrendered. A person who cannot be held criminally responsible for the offence in question by virtue of his or her age may not be surrendered. Sections 31, 33(1) and 35 of the Bill reflect these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Article 4 of the framework decision lists grounds upon which member states may rely, as opposed to non-mandatory grounds, for non-execution of European arrest warrants. Several of these are included in the Bill. Section 30 implements article 4.1 and requires that, with the exception of the offences on the "positive list", the offences specified in the warrant must correspond to offences under Irish law, with a necessary qualification to allow for variations in the designation of certain revenue offences. Clearly Revenue codes are not the same across Europe so that we will be dealing with substantial correspondence in those cases. Section 30 therefore implements the dual criminality requirement for offences other than those covered by the "positive list".</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Section 34 implements article 4.2 and 4.3. It provides that a person may not be surrendered where he or she is being proceeded against in the State in relation to the same offence or where it has been decided not to proceed or to halt proceedings against the person in the State in respect of the offence on which the warrant is based. In other words, if in Ireland a person is being proceeded against for the offence or if a decision has been made to halt or not to prosecute, that is a ground on which Ireland can refuse to extradite. Section 32 implements article 4.4 in prohibiting surrender where a prosecution for the same offence would not be permitted in the State by virtue of lapse of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Section 33(2) implements article 4.5 by prohibiting surrender where the person had been finally judged in a non-EU state and had served the sentence imposed or was no longer required to serve it. Section 36 implements article 4.7. It prohibits surrender where the offence occurred on the territory of the executing state or outside the territory of both the issuing and executing states and the offence is one over which the executing state does not have jurisdiction. Extra territorial offences or offences committed in Ireland are dealt with by that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Section 37 gives effect to article 5.1. It provides that where the person had been tried <i>in absentia</i>, surrender may be made subject to guarantees from the issuing state that the person will have an opportunity of a new trial and of being present at that trial. Article 11 contains the very important provision that a person must be informed of the right to legal assistance and interpretation services. A person arrested under either section 11 or section 12 of this Bill must be informed of these entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Article 12 provides that a person may be remanded on bail pending a decision on his or her surrender. Sections 11(5) and 12(5) of the Bill give effect to that provision. A person who consents to surrender, as provided for by article 13 and section 13(8) of the Bill may withdraw that consent. In such cases, the person is then entitled to a full hearing of the surrender application. Before accepting that the person has consented to his or her surrender, the court must be satisfied that the consent was voluntary and informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Article 14 provides a guarantee that an arrested person has a right to a hearing before being surrendered. This is given effect by sections 13 and 14 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Section 28 gives effect to article 26. It ensures that in the case of persons returned to Ireland, any time served in custody in the executing state pending a decision on the request will be taken into account in any sentence to be served here. A person surrendered by Ireland to another member state on foot of a European arrest warrant may not be surrendered or extradited by that other member state to a third member state or to a non-EU state without the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Sections 18 and 19 make provisions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Deputies will agree that the safeguards I have just outlined are real and comprehensive. However, before leaving this topic, I draw attention to the statement Ireland made when the framework decision was being adopted. The text of that statement is as follows: "Ireland shall, in the implementation in domestic legislation of this Framework Decision provide that the European arrest warrant shall only be executed for the purposes of bringing that person to trial or for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or detention order." The important point to note is that in cases where the person has not yet been convicted, the emphasis is on ensuring that the person is being sought to face trial. This is designed to ensure that persons are not surrendered in custody for investigative purposes, with the possibility of prolonged detention before a decision is taken on whether to charge that person. That is the substance of the Irish declaration.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Section 9(3) gives effect to Ireland's statement. It requires that the issuing judicial authority must provide written undertakings that the warrant is for purposes of the person being charged with and tried for the offence specified. In addition, it requires that there must be written confirmation that the person has been charged and that a decision to bring the person to trial has been made or, alternatively, that a decision has been taken in the issuing member state to proceed to charge and try the person once he or she has been returned to that member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Still on the question of safeguards, I want to mention briefly the position in relation to the accession states. As the House will be aware, eight states from central and eastern Europe as well as Cyprus and Malta will be joining the EU with effect from 1 May 2004. They will be expected to implement the framework decision as part of the <i>acquis</i> they will take on board as from that date. However, given the importance and sensitivity of the justice and home affairs issues, as well as some other matters, a special safeguard clause has been inserted into each of the accession treaties. The clause provides that the Commission should monitor implementation of framework decisions by the new member states and provides for remedial actions, including the suspension of the operation of framework decisions by those new member states in certain cases. This measure should allay concerns about the implementation of measures such as the European arrest warrant in the early years of EU membership by the accession states.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I wish to outline now how the new arrangements will operate. While, as I mentioned earlier, the new system is designed to be in very large measure an inter-court system, the framework decision, nevertheless, permits each member state to nominate a central authority. Its role is to provide administrative and technical assistance in relation to the transmission of warrants as well as supplemental information or documentation. It will also liaise with relevant authorities in other member states in connection with arrangements for the handing over of wanted persons and property. That is relevant because in the majority of states in Europe the judiciary has an investigative role of its own, but in Ireland that is put on the Executive side of the constitutional structure so that we have to put in place a central authority which is effectively not the court itself. That is the reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will perform that central authority function and it enables the Minister to delegate by order certain of the central authority functions to other agencies or persons should the need arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The High Court will be the judicial authority with responsibility for the execution of European arrest warrants received by Ireland. Any Irish courts having jurisdiction in criminal matters may issue a European arrest warrant, on application from or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, where a person now in another member state is facing charges or is required to serve a sentence in Ireland. In all cases, the warrants will be transmitted, inwards and outwards, by the central authority. European arrest warrants may be in their original form or may be sent by fax or electronically. Electronic transmission may, in due course, be via the Schengen information system, SIS. Ireland has opted to participate in elements of the Schengen Convention and arrangements are being put in place to establish the necessary systems and procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Section 11 provides that following receipt of a European arrest warrant, it will be brought to the High Court for its endorsement. Endorsement of the warrant by the High Court will have the effect of authorising the arrest of the named person. The powers of the gardaí to make an arrest in these circumstances are provided by section 20. It includes powers to enter premises to effect the arrest and to seize goods and property considered to be connected with or the proceeds of the offence specified in the European arrest warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The possibility of an arrest where the gardaí are satisfied, based on information available on the SIS, when that system is up and running, that a European arrest warrant exists, but has not yet been received is provided for by section 12. The information on the SIS must indicate that where the person has not yet been convicted, he or she is to face trial rather than being sought for investigative purposes. An arrest under section 12 must be based on a reasonable belief that the person will leave the State prior to the European arrest warrant being received here. Where there are no grounds for such a belief, the question of an arrest must await the arrival of the European arrest warrant and in those circumstances the procedures I have outlined for section 11 apply. In cases of arrests under section 12, the European arrest warrant must be produced within seven days of the arrest, otherwise the person must be released. That mirrors provisional warrants which are already provided for under classical extradition provisions in Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">A person who has been arrested, whether under section 11 or 12, must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible after his or her arrest. The court may remand the person in custody or on bail and it will also fix a date for the full hearing of the application. However, a person has a right to consent to surrender at this or any later stage. Section 13 deals with such cases. In these cases a full hearing will not be required if the court is satisfied that the person has given his or her consent voluntarily and in full knowledge of the consequences. As I indicated earlier, a person who has consented may withdraw that consent. Withdrawal of consent will give rise to the need for a full hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Section 14 provides that the High Court may, after satisfying itself that the person before it is the person named in the European arrest warrant and after hearing the application, make an order for the person's surrender. However, it may do so only where it is satisfied that all the provisions in the Bill are complied with. There is a stay of 15 days before the order takes effect and the person will normally be surrendered within a further ten day period. Upon making the order, the court must remand the person in custody and inform him or her of the provisions of Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution which allow for <i>habeas corpus</i> applications. Section 14(10) provides for appeals on points of law to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Section 17 deals with the rule of specialty which provides that a person who has been extradited or surrendered to another state may be proceeded against in that other state in respect only of the offence or offences for which he or she was extradited or surrendered unless the consent of the extraditing country has been previously obtained. That remains the basic position but certain limitations are introduced. The framework decision and the Bill provide that a person may be proceeded against for offences other than those for which he or she was surrendered where such offences attract financial penalties only or where a sentence of imprisonment will not arise. Neither will the rule apply where the person in question consents, either before or after his surrender, to being proceeded against for other offences. In both cases, the court must satisfy itself that any consent given has been or will be given freely and in awareness of the consequences. As is the case under current extradition rules, specialty will not be applied in cases where the issuing judicial authority requests the central authority in this State to waive the rule and the Minister agrees to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Sections 18 and 19 provide that a person who has been surrendered on foot of a European arrest warrant may not be surrendered to a third member state or to a third country, that is, to a non-EU state, unless the person gives voluntary and informed consent or unless the Minister in this State agrees to the onward surrender, having regard to the safeguard provisions in Part 3 of the Bill and in the framework decision. In cases where the request is for the extradition of the person from the member state to which he or she has been surrendered to a non-EU state, the High Court will also be required to give its consent and it may do so only where it is satisfied that the requirements of the Extradition Act 1965 are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Sections 24 and 25 of the Bill set out the procedures and criteria to be applied when there are several European arrest warrants for the same person but from different member states, or where there are European arrest warrants from one or more member states and extradition requests from one or more non-EU states.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Sections 26 to 28, inclusive, deal with the arrangements for the issuing of European arrest warrants by Ireland. Section 27 provides that applications may be made to any court having jurisdiction in criminal matters by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The courts in question are the District and Circuit Criminal Courts, the Central Criminal Court and the Special Criminal Court. A European arrest warrant may be applied for where a warrant for the arrest of the person has already issued in the State and the person is not in the State. The warrant must be in respect of an offence having a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or more, or where the person has already been convicted, a sentence of four months or more has to be served. The court that issues the European arrest warrant will be required to indicate whether the European arrest warrant is in respect of an offence that comes within the "positive list", an offence listed in article 2.2 of the framework decision that carries a penalty of three years imprisonment or more under Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The executing judicial authority in the other member state will be obliged to accept that certification and the question of the dual criminality of the offence shall not be considered further. As I indicated earlier, the reverse applies in the case of European arrest warrants which are to be executed in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I referred earlier to the guarantee in section 28 to the effect that a person who is detained in custody in another member state while the European arrest warrant issued by Ireland is being processed in that other member state shall be entitled to have that period of detention taken into account when determining, following surrender, the period of sentence to be served, if any, in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Part 3 of the Bill, sections 29 to 38, inclusive, contains the safeguards I spoke about earlier. I do not propose to cover that ground again but I emphasise that every application that comes before the High Court will be subject to these safeguards and no application for a surrender on foot of a European arrest warrant may be granted unless and until those safeguards are satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Part 4 contains a number of miscellaneous amendments to our existing extradition law. The Extradition Act 1965 contains the main provisions. It has already been amended on a number of occasions, twice in 1987, again in 1994 and most recently in 2001. Section 39 of the Bill proposes to amend section 3 of the 1965 Act. It is proposed to amend the definition of "country" to include "territories" for which that country has responsibility at the level of international relations. The immediate purpose of this amendment is to ensure that extradition arrangements with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands can continue to operate. Those territories will not be operating the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and it has been agreed with the UK authorities that extradition arrangements with those territories should, instead, operate on the basis of the 1957 European Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I referred just now to an agreement with the UK in relation to future extradition arrangements with certain UK territories. That was part of a wider discussion with the UK authorities on arrangements to apply once the European arrest warrant enters into operation on 1 January next. Article 31.2 of the framework decision deals with cases where there are bilateral arrangements in force such as the "backing of warrants" arrangement we have with the UK. It states: "Member states may continue to apply bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements in force when this framework decision is adopted in so far as such agreements or arrangements allow the objectives of the framework decision to be extended or enlarged and help to simplify or facilitate further the procedures for surrender of persons who are the subject of European arrest warrants." This is the legal test to be applied to existing arrangements. Applying these criteria, it was agreed with the UK that the existing "backing of warrants" arrangement does not satisfy the legal test in question and will therefore be replaced as from January next with the European arrest warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 provides the legal basis for the "backing of warrants" arrangement. Among a number of technical amendments I propose to bring forward on Committee Stage is an amendment to provide for the formal repeal of Part III. While the effect of the Bill will be to render Part C of the 1965 Act redundant, I understand that the UK legislation on the implementation of the framework decision will also provide for the formal repeal of its legislation on the "backing of warrants" arrangement, namely, the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Section 39(1)(<i>b</i>) and 39(2) amend sections 1A and 1B of the 1965 Act, as inserted by the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001. Sections 1A and 1B of the 1965 Act provide that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may designate member states with which Ireland will operate the 1995 and 1996 EU Conventions on Extradition. Under the terms of the 2001 amendments, the conventions could apply only between Ireland and other member states. However, in the meantime it has been agreed by the EU that all or part of the conventions should apply in relations between the member states and Norway and Iceland, and between those two states. The amendment proposed will allow the Minister to designate states other than member states, thus allowing Ireland to participate in the extension of the territorial scope of the conventions. These amendments must be read together with the amendments introduced by section 41 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">This amends sections 4 and 10 of the 2001 Act by providing that the 1995 and 1996 conventions may be deemed to have been adopted in whole or in part by countries designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for that purpose. The overall effect of these changes is that non-EU states may be deemed to have adopted the 1995 and 1996 EU conventions or parts thereof and where that occurs Ireland may then operate those conventions with states that have been deemed to have adopted them.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Section 4 amends the procedural requirements in section 10 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism Act) 1987 for the laying of orders before each House of the Oireachtas. It is proposed that orders shall take effect 21 days after being laid unless annulled. The orders under section 10 of the 1987 Act are for the purpose of extending the provision of that Act to apply between Ireland and countries that are not parties to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The amendments bring the procedures under section 10 into line with the amendments to section 4 of the 1965 Act which were introduced by section 21 of the 2001 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">In conclusion, this Bill represents a major development in our relations with other EU member states. It is mandatory for us to do this. EU law requires us to transpose the framework decision into Irish law and I hope the Deputies will appreciate that this is not a policy initiative in which we are free agents to accept or reject these matters. Under international law we must give effect to the framework decision in a manner which we adjudge to be correct and which is consistent with our obligations under EU treaties.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_529">I traced the origin of this Bill to the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001, when EU member states decided they needed better co-operation on extradition between their legal systems. They did so for good reason. While the citizens of the member states have benefited greatly from the opportunities created by, and the removal of barriers to, the movement of people and services in the EU, those freedoms and opportunities need protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I read an article in a national newspaper last Sunday which described our security services and the present threat from international terrorism. An expert in risk management in this field said that Dublin is full of soft targets for terrorists and especially in areas such as Ballsbridge where there are many embassies which could be susceptible to an international terrorist threat. He said our security services are gravely inadequate and could not obtain information on a terrorist threat aimed at foreign diplomatic missions here if one arose in the short-term. It made me wonder how prepared we are for such an attack. He went on to say there is a lack of shared intelligence between the agencies here and that we will be fortunate to remain unscathed in the long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I also read the Department of Defence strategy statement 2003-2005 which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_532">On a day to day basis, internal security is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána. Defence, however, plays a key role in providing, on request, aid to the civil power.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">It continues:</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It is essential also that the cross-cutting dimensions of security are recognised and that the structures and arrangements currently in place at Government level, at inter-Departmental level and at operational level between the Garda and the military authorities are maintained to ensure integrated service planning and delivery. In this regard there has been a reduction in the internal threat to national security emanating from republican and loyalist paramilitary groupings. However, as this threat reduced, the potential threat from international terrorism increased (although that threat is currently assessed as low) and this has implications for the internal security situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">It then mentions a review and the changing security environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The risk analyst interviewed in last Sunday's newspaper contradicts that, saying there is unquestionably a threat. Britain recently escalated its threat level while our Department of Defence believes the threat is insignificant in terms of Irish interests without realising that the threat against British and US diplomatic interests here is as high as in Britain and the US. I have not come in here to make political points because on the last few occasions when the Minister and I were here we ended by shouting at one another. That threat needs to be examined on a bipartisan level to establish whether there is any truth in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Deputy Gay Mitchell talked about our mutual defence arrangement over the last year. While it is clear that we cannot hold EU summit meetings in Ireland, which I appreciate was not our decision, do we have the requisite air defences, or a contingency plan, or are we prepared to deal with the kind of terrorist attack witnessed recently in Istanbul? The risk analyst argues that we do not. The Department of Defence strategy statement does not make our contingency plan clear. What are the contingency plans within the Garda Síochána? Do we have the requisite intelligence on an ongoing basis, for example, does the immigration bureau follow up illegal immigrants? Is our intelligence sophisticated enough to deter terrorist threats? Deputy Gay Mitchell once said that Ireland is not part of any alliance and is not equipped to defend its neutrality. This makes it the most vulnerable state in Europe in terms of possible outside attack. Perhaps the Minister could deal with this in his final speech. The analyst's point is fair and this legislation is rooted in the fear among EU member states that we were not co-operating enough to deal with that kind of threat. This analyst says that the threat exists here but we are taking it too lightly and we are vulnerable which is very serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In general, this legislation would replace the existing system of extradition and make it compulsory for a person wanted for an offence punishable by at least a year in prison to be handed over to the authorities in the member state that requests his or her surrender. If someone is extradited for one offence can he or she then be tried for another? Is it clear that people will not be held in investigative detention before a decision is made to charge them, rendering automatic the extradition of persons wanted for questioning who have not been charged with any offence? Is it clear that Ireland deals with the extradition of people to states which extradite to Ireland only with full reciprocity? The Minister has explained the safeguards protecting the liberties and rights of individuals. I am unclear about the time limits in this Bill which refers to a 60 or 90 day limit but this is quite open-ended. I understand the Oireachtas cannot direct the Judiciary in this regard and it is more a case of "should" than "must" or "will" in that it is not written as firmly as in other jurisdictions. Perhaps the Minister can explain how this came about.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Minister touched on dual criminality. Ireland was initially opposed to the Commission's proposal to abolish the dual criminality principle. At the end of 2001, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, said that he would have great difficulty in explaining to someone why he or she should be extradited for something which is not a crime in Ireland. One of the initial concerns was that there was a potential problem of being asked to extradite to Ireland someone suspected of carrying out an abortion, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I read through the list of crimes described by the Minister as the positive list. The first crime listed there was membership of an organised crime gang. Considering the Minister's recent statements on membership of organised crime gangs, there is an irony there. If one commits the offence of being a member of a criminal gang in Spain, for example, then under this legislation one can be extradited from that country even though it is not a specific offence to be a gang member in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">When the Taoiseach announced the agreement in December 2001, he said it would be very effective in helping to combat organised crime across the European Union. An Irish person accused of being a member of an organised crime gang in another jurisdiction will have ten days to give himself or herself up in that country. If that person refuses to go voluntarily, the Garda will have up to 60 or 90 days to verify that the correct person has been identified and should be deported for trial. The Minister said he has extreme difficulty in considering introducing measures to make organisation of a gang illegal. However, he has no difficulty in allowing an Irish person to be extradited and prosecuted for being a member of an organised crime gang elsewhere. This legislation would allow for that. Once a warrant is issued by a judge in one state, it would have to be executed in the other if it involves one of these offences on the so-called positive list. There is no difficulty in allowing an Irish citizen to be tried as a member of an organised crime gang as long as it does not happen on Irish soil. That is what this legislation would entail.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Recent Government policy with regard to the EU and criminal law is pretty schizophrenic. The Minister has on quite a few occasions questioned the EU's involvement concerning Irish criminal law and is entitled to do so. The position he takes is at odds with previous Government positions. We need to combat serious crime at the European level. As the Minister said, we have a much expanded Europe without borders, and we need to accept that the security threats now posed by terrorists are changing, and becoming far more ominous. There has been some reluctance on the Minister's part to deal with or engage in these matters. He mentioned his resistance to harmonisation of EU criminal law with our own criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The position of the working group on justice and home affairs is a bit clearer. That group has regularly expressed the principle of mutual recognition as a basis for policing and criminal law matters between member states. That is what we are dealing with now. This legislation encapsulates the idea of mutual recognition which is based on mutual respect for each other's legal systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">It has been suggested by the Minister that this concept of mutual recognition might allow for interference in the criminal justice systems of individual member states. There are unique problems in the field of crime in an economic area that has no borders, which is why Europol and Eurojuste were created. We have to deal with issues like drug dealing and human trafficking, with organised crime. We cannot close our eyes to that. The Minister has however suggested that our criminal law system could be compromised or undermined by EU input. That is not necessarily the case. It is essential that the appropriate safeguards are put in place for the protection of an individual's rights, and that the core elements of our criminal justice system are maintained. I have no argument with that, but we must involve ourselves a little deeper in this process. I understand that no submissions were made by the Department of Justice to the working group on justice and home affairs when it was finalising its report.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">If there is to be effective prosecution and policing of crime within the EU, member states must be prepared to work together. I say that because what happened in Istanbul recently could happen in Ireland. That is not an outrageous statement. We need to deal, work and co-operate with EU member states in this regard. I acknowledge that there are two completely different legal traditions within the EU, but an accommodation must be made between them when decisions are taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">People have suggested that attempts are being made to create a unified system of criminal law for the whole of the EU. We possess a distinct legal and constitutional culture in this State. We do not need to sacrifice too much in this area in order to properly co-operate in criminal matters with fellow member states. Sometimes I wonder if the Minister for Justice gets involved in legal debates and arguments for the sake of it. Perhaps he does so just to impress his EU counterparts. Looking back at the history of this issue over the past two or three years, my concern is that we need to co-operate with the other EU states. I understand that anyone has the right to voice his or her opinion, and ask questions about our criminal law system and that of the European Union, but we must co-operate and be prepared to integrate our criminal law systems so that they can prevent events such as the recent bombing in Istanbul. We must co-operate with the other EU member states and hone the level of co-operation to the optimum.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I look forward to discussing this on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to address in his wrap-up speech my concern regarding our state of readiness and preparedness, and the type of contingency plans we should have in light of the growing threat of international terrorism. We have soft targets in this country. We cannot presume we will not be the target of an international terrorist attack. Not only do we have embassies in Dublin, but we also have British and US interests all around the country. It is a question of preparedness and intelligence. I am not sure we currently have that capability or that we can protect against a co-ordinated and well orchestrated terrorist attack. That should be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_548">I welcome the Minister. I listened carefully to his wide-ranging contribution. We have very important legislation before us. In many ways it looks at what the European Union was set up to do and how it is supposed to do it. The European Union was criticised in the past for concentrating too much on economic matters and not enough on social matters, and possibly legal co-operation and criminal matters too. Essentially, the European Union has been a marketplace for the exchange and transfer of goods and services. We have accepted the principles of the marketplace. There is much goodwill between the member states. Is the abolition of our extradition legislation a step too far? Is it time to stop and think? These are matters which are underpinned by the Constitution and by international conventions and where our history, traditions and legislation differ. Many European states base their legal systems on the <i>Code Napoléon</i> while our own is a common law legal system. What are the implications of this measure for Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I remind the Minister of the Nice treaty debate when an incredible amount of soul searching was done. The first referendum was strongly defeated on the basis of a perceived democratic deficit. People felt that they did not know what was going on and, in so far as they did, they were concerned that things were not being done properly. The major institutions of the Euopean Union were at fault in not providing adequate information and the public suspected that they were operating in a fashion which was not fully democratic at every level, apart from the European Parliament. The Council of Ministers and the Commission, above all, were seen as bodies which operated behind closed doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The Minister regularly comes before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights prior to his monthly visits to Brussels and asks for the select committee's <i>imprimatur</i> on the discussions he will have there. When he does not get it I am sure he goes ahead with the discussions anyway. The matters then go to the Dáil and are passed, without debate, to the select committee, where they are debated. Can the Minister say that is a satisfactory mechanism? Is the legislation before us today being dealt with in a satisfactory way?</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The process of European Union scrutiny is flawed and it is most flawed in the manner in which this legislation has come before us. I understand that my predecessor, Deputy Howlin, received the original Framework Document immediately before he came into the Chamber to debate it. The same was true for the spokepersons for the other Opposition parties. No proper opportunity was given to discuss the contents of that far reaching directive which would have binding intent. Once it was passed by the House we were bound to transpose it into our domestic law. That is no way to do business. It puts the cart before the horse. We are debating the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003, but previously the House was presented with a document which it had no time to study or debate. On that occasion the debate lasted less than an hour on legislation which ties the hands of subsequent legislators, although we can make some minor changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights receives a considerable number of proposals which have far-reaching implications for mutual recognition between member states. The select committee recently discussed this matter in the context of the extension of a mutual recognition treaty to Norway and Iceland, which had already been agreed at European level. The committee does not have the opportunity to research or scrutinise the contents of these documents. A couple of weeks ago the select committee recommended that there should be no Dáil debate on one such document. The committee tail was wagging the Oireachtas dog. Whatever takes place in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights usually marks the end of the affair.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Arising out of the Nice treaty, the mechanism for scrutiny of European measures was put in place. However, the sub-committee established to oversee this is not adequately resourced and it is not effective in scrutinising the vast quantity of important documentation which comes before select committees. This is true, not only of the justice area but also of other areas. The situation will go from bad to worse as greater quantities of European Union documentation are decided upon inadequately and then transposed into Irish legislation. Adequate resources must be provided for this work if it is to be done in a proper fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Too much legislation coming from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is initiated in Europe and not in Ireland. A great proportion of our legislation is being led by decisions promoted in other jurisdictions and in other contexts and does not emanate from our own jurisdiction. While we acknowledge the principle of subsidiarity we are, nevertheless, introducing and implementing legislation which someone else has determined is good for us. We want mutual co-operation but when that extends to mutual recognition we move onto a different plane and we expect basic standards and equivalences to operate across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">This development has curtailed the corpus of domestic legislation coming from the Minister's Department. I am sure the Minister is as frustrated by this as the rest of us. A vast quantity of Bills and proposed legislation appears on the Order Paper but the House does not reach the items on the list and the legislation is not passed. The last legislation initiated in the Minister's Department which was passed in the House was a Bill to allow the appointment of two High Court judges. That debate was guillotined, as is this debate. It is not acceptable that, knowing that this legislation must be enacted by 1 January 2004, we are obliged to curtail the debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Several other Bills have not been reached. Legislation to regulate the private security industry, which has been on the list for the past two or three years, was debated before the summer. The Bill has passed Committee Stage but it has not yet reached Report Stage. The area of private security services is crying out for domestic regulation. The sector is a major component in the operation of security. It has more than the combined numbers in the Army and Garda but it has not yet been regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I have a criticism of the Minister. The Intoxicating Liquor Bill was guillotined in its presentation and procedure as was the Immigration Bill. Another Bill will be guillotined before the end of this term and the House must deal with it before it rises.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The administrative process should be examined. There is a fundamental difference between this legislation and other Bills dealing with the European context. Police co-operation was dealt with under the Framework Document and the Treaty of Amsterdam. Under this Bill, our extradition procedure will be abolished and replaced by a type of fast track mechanism by means of a court order issued from the issuing jurisdiction to the requesting jurisdiction. The court will examine and scrutinise the order in terms of its administrative content and not in terms of its substance. If everything is above board in terms of the processing of the order, it will then be processed and examined. Essentially it is an administrative process, not a judicial process, which is the fundamental change.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The Bill deals with the abolition of extradition but also with prosecution matters. We are talking about accepting a court order emanating from a different jurisdiction such as Poland, Cyprus, Malta, France or Greece. We cannot presume that such jurisdictions have the same judicial programme, the same criminal justice system, the same safeguards or the same protections as operate in Ireland. We do not know a thing about them. We are acting purely on the goodwill of the issuing state and we must accept without question that such is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Once the order goes through and the Minister decides it is within the time limit and the details are correct, how can we be sure the European Convention on Human Rights is operational in the other jurisdiction? How can we prevent a situation arising whereby a series of other activities could take place later on? The Minister stated that safeguards have been inserted. The safeguard is that there should not be any further investigation, but how will the Minister ensure this?</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Bill will give effect to Ireland's statement that in its domestic laws it will provide the European arrest warrant will be executed solely for the purpose of bringing a person to trial or for the execution of a sentence. Can the Minister assure the House this will be the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The framework decision is in respect of a person fleeing from justice. Extradition procedures are to be speeded up in respect of persons suspected of committing an offence. Ireland's approach to dealing with offences is not the same as the investigative approach used in the <i>Code Napoléon</i>where the prosecution and the investigation are part and parcel of the same procedure. Can the Minister ensure no investigation takes place when an extradition has been allowed for a prosecution? I do not believe it is possible because we have neither equivalent jurisdictions, equivalent criminal justice systems nor equivalent procedures in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I regard that as a rather flimsy statement by Ireland. It provides a fig leaf of safety that presumes nothing can happen because sufficient protections have been provided and everything is hunky dory. I do not believe that can be accepted because there is no mechanism for checking after the event. I ask the Minister to address that issue. Is the Minister aware of any monitoring mechanisms being used in the European Union? Will the Minister say what sort of data will be compiled about the requesting jurisdictions?</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I wish to deal with the issue of dual criminality. The Minister states that he had some difficulty with the fact that there were 32 offences other than those which are dual offences in each of the jurisdictions of the European Union. He states that his concerns were allayed when he discovered that all 32 of the additional offences were offences in this jurisdiction but that is not the case; they are not offences in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The first offence listed is that of participation in a criminal organisation. There is no such offence in this jurisdiction. Such an offence is dealt with under the Special Criminal Court but we are not dealing with that court. I ask the Minister to correct his statement to the House. I am amazed the House has been debating this issue of membership of a criminal organisation every Monday, Tuesday and Friday for the last week and will do so again—</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_567">—in the hearings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Minister is on record in the media as stating that he has great difficulty with this issue of an offence of participation in a criminal organisation. He has said it cannot be defined and a proper statutory offence cannot be provided. In his latest statement he said he would re-examine it. Now he has told the House that it is part of the law of the land. The issue concerns dual criminality in the jurisdictions of the European Union and 32 other offences, including the first on the list about which the Minister has grave doubts, and whether this can be incorporated into Irish law. He has told the House he is not the least bit worried because he is satisfied all these offences are already part of Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Minister is talking off the top of his head about these matters, as he does about so many others. Today it is one thing, and tomorrow it is another but it is not the way to do business. The Minister should outline his position on this issue, which is most serious and should have been addressed by now. He should already have come up with proposals to deal with it. It appears he is prepared to accept the EU's approach to these fundamental issues of criminal justice, across the board. This is the same Minister who spoke out so strongly about the wonderful principles of our common law system and the great strengths of the Constitution, and who said that under no circumstances should we allow them to be undermined or tainted by notions from mainland Europe. When a fundamental issue arises, however, lip service is paid to safeguards without sufficient mechanisms to ensure they will be put in place. Neither is there any mechanism to ensure that a hearing of an application will take place, or that the results of such an application can be monitored. We are buying a pig in a poke. The Minister's U-turn is amazing because when he goes to Brussels he is able to accept EU proposals without any substantial change. Such changes are needed, however, to provide for safeguards, which are currently non-existent.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">There are question marks over the constitutionality of this legislation which proposes to change profoundly the existing legal mechanisms. The Constitution commits us to granting all citizens due legal process including a fair hearing, so in a sense we will diminish that commitment by allowing other jurisdictions to deal with our citizens in a fashion that would amount to far less than the normal burden of proof to be expected. If we further allow the law of speciality to go by the wayside, whereby somebody can be charged with another offence in the jurisdiction to which they are extradited, it will raise another serious question. If a request does not come through relating to the specific offence, how can one allow such a matter to be prosecuted? What are the safeguards in such a case? How can one possibly prosecute an offence without investigation? Therefore, any new offence that could possibly be dealt with, without being referred to in the order, must, of its nature, be tainted in procedural terms and will give rise to further questions about the constitutionality of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The issue with which we are dealing points up the lack of effectiveness in our procedures for dealing with EU Framework Documents and directives. We will have to tighten up the procedures and provide far more resources to ensure that we are not faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>in future. It is incredible that we are bound to pass this legislation because of events that have already taken place. We have reneged on our commitment to provide adequate scrutiny of EU proposals. If the Bill is enacted, we will be diminishing the protection normally accorded to our citizens by the mechanisms accepted as the <i>modus operandi</i> for transmitting and executing court orders. We are not putting in place adequate safeguards, including monitoring procedures, to ensure that no wrong is done to anyone who is extradited on foot of one of these orders.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">The Bill will simplify and expedite extradition between EU member states. It is obviously considered by the Minister and others to be an essential element of the so-called EU anti-terrorism road map but it will undermine long-standing and hard-won civil liberties and basic freedoms. For this reason, Sinn Féin called a vote against the proposed framework decision on the European arrest warrant when the Government rushed it through the House two years ago, at short notice after an hour's debate from which the sole Sinn Féin Deputy was excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">This is a controversial measure and perhaps the Minister is right in saying it is mandatory because of the earlier rushed debate. However, many other regulations and EU directives are not being rushed through the Oireachtas, despite the deadlines involved. For example, we are now in breach of the EU race directive, so there is no need for us to rush this legislation through the House so that it can come into effect on the date the Minister has specified. Given the amount of legislation coming before the House, we will probably be in breach of many EU regulations until we have the proper resources for committees, including the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">If we refuse to proceed with this Bill we will not be the only State in breach of the EU directive because only four EU member states have so far passed the necessary legislation. In Germany, lawyers have mounted a legal challenge to the legislation which would give effect to the framework decision. Significantly, our own Human Rights Commission has produced an opinion to the Minister, which should be taken into account by the Government and the House. The commission concluded that the framework decision is based on a flawed presumption of effective and equivalent protections of accused persons' rights between EU member states. It concluded that the original scheme of the Minister's Bill paid insufficient regard to the protection of human rights. It further concluded that even with the safeguards now added, the Bill before the House is still likely to diminish constitutional protections regarding extradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">For our part, Sinn Féin believes certain rights are unacceptably negated by the EU arrest warrant proposals before the House. We are not convinced that the safeguards introduced are adequate. We therefore remain strongly opposed to this Bill and to the securocrat, EU-federalist agenda it represents. The Government should not have backed the framework decision in the first place. The resulting legislation is irredeemably flawed and insupportable.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I strongly disagree with the Labour position as expressed by Deputy Howlin in the 2001 debate, although I welcome the fact that the party has now adopted a more acceptable position. In 2001, Deputy Howlin said that the measure successfully balances the need for security with freedoms and civil liberties.</p>

          <p eId="para_590">At least he has changed the view and he explained the reason mistakes were made in 2001 but I believe the opposite is the case. There cannot be a trade-off between security and people's freedoms. True human security can never be achieved where basic rights are limited or eroded. Rights and security are inherently indivisible.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The Secretary General of Amnesty International, Ms Irene Khan, expressed concern earlier this year, and she is worth quoting at length. Deputy Deasy, who has left the Chamber, called earlier for a fortress Ireland approach but Ms Khan stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Governments around the world have spent billions in an effort to beef up national security and the "war on terror", but for millions of people the real sources of insecurity were corrupt and inept systems of policing and justice; brutal repression of political dissent; severe discrimination and social inequities; extreme poverty and the spread of preventable diseases. . . .  The "war on terror", far from making the world a safer place, has made it more dangerous by curtailing human rights, undermining the rule of international law and shielding governments from scrutiny. It has deepened divisions among people of different faiths and origins, sowing the seeds for more conflict . . . It is vital that we resist the manipulation of fear and challenge the narrow focus of the security agenda. The definition of security must be broadened to encompass the security of people, as well as states. That means a commitment to human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Amnesty International's view is also reflected by Human Rights Watch which warned in its 2002 annual global survey that the so-called war on terror has inspired "opportunistic attacks on civil liberties around the world". In its comments on the proposed EU-wide security measures it specifically cited the lack of fair trial guarantees in the EU arrest warrant proposal as possibly violating human rights norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The increasingly widespread conclusion that we are compelled to sacrifice basic rights in pursuit of a so-called war on terrorism is symptomatic of a broader ideological shift taking place in the democratic world. It is a disturbing shift that actually brings us closer to the undemocratic regimes we oppose. It also reflects a potentially disastrous approach to security that will not succeed in preventing further unjustifiable actions such as the assault on civilian targets in the United States on 11 September 2001, and may have the opposite effect. That is a matter of deep concern for Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Statewatch, the non-governmental organisation dedicated to monitoring civil liberties in the EU, believes the so-called war on terrorism has turned into an ongoing war on freedom and democracy that is setting new international norms, curtailing and rolling back accountability, scrutiny and rights protections. It argues trenchantly that the so-called war on terrorism has replaced the Cold War as a legitimate ideology in both the EU and the US for the re-emergent predominance of security, allowing what were formerly considered emergency powers to become the norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The director of the British Institute of Race Relations has further argued that while globalisation has set up a monolithic economic system, with all its faults – we can debate that issue another day – the response to the events of 11 September threatens to engender a monolithic political culture, and together, they spell the end of civil society. Let us be clear. The EU is an active protagonist in shaping this new ideology and giving it operational effect through measures such as those we are debating today.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">While it would be easy for some Deputies to agree with the Bill on superficial consideration – none of us wants serious crimes such as rape and murder to go unpunished – that is not what Sinn Féin is suggesting in its opposition to this measure. We have a responsibility to decide our position on the Bill in a proper context, which is one of the legislative measures that form the EU anti-terrorism road map hurriedly agreed in the weeks following the tragedies on September 11. The EU arrest warrant was considered so central to the EU action plan it was proposed for fast-tracking, together with its companion legislative measure which has already come before the House, the Terrorist Offences Bill giving effect to the establishment of a common definition, which itself has been widely criticised including by our own Human Rights Commission as being too broad in scope and infringing on the legitimate right to opposition. The road map measures have far-reaching consequences for the rights of Irish citizens and citizens within the EU and, as such, they deserve far more scrutiny by this House than has been the case to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I am not just concerned about the political and ideological context of the Bill, and I will table amendments on Committee Stage to deal with some of the issues, but my concerns also include the planned abolition of the dual criminality requirement for a list of 32 crimes; the inclusion of terrorism on the positive list in the context of the overly-broad EU common definition I mentioned earlier; the removal of the traditional category exemptions from extradition, including political offences; the proposed limits on the so-called specialty rule; and the fact that it authorises the illegitimate, internationally criticised Special Criminal Court to order an EU arrest warrant. It is time this no-jury court was abolished, not further reinforced by new legislation. The Minister criticised it when he said that "a jury trial . . . is one of the chief guarantors against oppressive misuse of state authority". He needs to make up his mind. It is either one or the other. I will come back to that aspect on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_599">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003. Before I go into the details of the Bill, it is important to remind the Minister of some basic core principles on human rights. I realise it is not very trendy or fashionable to raise issues of human rights but the day we turn our backs on the rights of our citizens is a bad day for those of us who support social justice and democratic values.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">This debate allows us the opportunity to set the record straight on this important issue. Those of us who demand high standards in terms of the rights of people are not the enemies of our justice system. It is important to record that. The primary goal of the criminal justice system is to protect society from conduct that injures its members. The way in which that protection is structured and delivered is crucial. A criminal justice system can range from respecting the rights of all those affected by it to becoming an instrument of oppression and prejudice. It is vital, therefore, that we are constantly vigilant to ensure that in our outrage at acts of violence, cruelty or abuse, we do not rush to judgment. The task is to establish and maintain a system which protects those suspected or accused of wrongdoing from being exposed to laws or rules of evidence which fail to protect their rights under the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, recently incorporated into domestic law, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the wide range of other applicable international human rights instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Offences must be designed clearly to ensure that people know when their conduct is likely to fall under criminal sanction. The Supreme Court made this clear in the King decision in 1980, when it held that Articles 38.1, 40.1 and 40.3 of the Constitution had been violated by an offence whose ingredients lacked clarity. The European Court of Human Rights also requires clarity of definition.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Prosecutions must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, which means, and is intended to mean, that those against whom there is reasonable suspicion that they may have committed an offence, will be acquitted. The criminal justice system is premised on restraint by society in the exercise of its awesome powers of individuals. The injustice and harm done to innocent people are so serious that the bar for successful prosecutions is set as high as is necessary to remove the risk of the conviction of the innocent.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The purpose of the legislation is to give effect to the provisions of the Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member states of the European Union and provides for matters connected therewith. The surrender arrangements for wanted persons being introduced by the European arrest warrant will replace, with effect from 1 January 2004, the existing extradition arrangements between Ireland and all other European Union member states, and will also apply between Ireland and the new accession states as soon as they adopt the necessary domestic measures, which is expected to be from 1 May 2004. It replaces, as between the EU member states, the existing extradition arrangements based on the Council of Europe's 1957 European Convention on Extradition with a simplified surrender procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I note that the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003 is designed to implement a framework decision of the Council of the European Union, which is part of a package of hastily developed, wide-ranging, draconian measures known as the EU anti-terrorism road map. Human rights organisations, including Human Rights Watch, have warned that the measures proposed in the road map, including the European arrest warrant, could violate human rights norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Human Rights Commission has raised similar concerns that the measures were developed without giving adequate consideration to human rights and civil liberties standards. Its analysis concluded that the framework decision on the European arrest warrant is based on a flawed presumption of effective and equivalent protections of accused persons' rights between EU member states. It also concluded that the original scheme of the Bill paid insufficient regard to the protection of human rights and that even with safeguards now included in the legislation, the Bill is still likely to diminish the constitutional protections regarding extradition. This legislation unacceptably negates certain fundamental rights, including the right not to be extradited for a political offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">I will not take moral or ethical lectures on the issue of extradition from other Deputies or from countries such as Britain and Spain which have been directly involved in acts of state terrorism. The same standards also apply to countries such as the United States. While we are discussing the subject of terrorism, I draw the attention of the House to the case of the Miami Five towards whom many European countries are acting in a hostile manner. We should not forget this group of five innocent Cubans who were trying to stop right-wing, Miami-based groups from carrying out violent actions against the people of Cuba. They were found guilty of charges ranging from murder to espionage by a court in Miami, which relied on the evidence of right-wing paramilitaries and all are innocent of the charges brought against them. Extensive intimidation of jurors by the same right-wing groups was a feature of the trial and the five are appealing their convictions. I call for the release and exoneration of these victims of a miscarriage of justice. The campaign on behalf of the Miami Five is dedicated to the memory of the 3,478 Cubans killed and 2,099 maimed at the hands of US-based terrorists since 1959.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">These and similar issues are linked to this debate. There appears to be silence on certain types of violence, particularly when states are involved. Human rights and democratic principles can never be sacrificed for a political agenda – it is not acceptable. This legislation is an attack on fundamental rights and, as such, I will vote against it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_608">Some people may go as far as to argue that the European Arrest Warrant Bill is a new and efficient way of bringing back suspected criminals who have fled abroad and persons convicted of grave crimes. Some might argue that it will bring faster and simpler procedures and that it is a more accountable system since countries can no longer refuse to surrender their own nationals. As good as this may seem on the surface, I cannot avoid asking what it is we are bargaining in exchange for such efficient procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Our law has been based on the development of judicial decisions over centuries and is best known as common law, whereas other member states have a system based on a single code of law – civil law. Common law has one major advantage over civil law, namely, it traditionally protects the rights of individuals. I fear we are sacrificing our common law for the sake of harmonisation and creating a danger that individual rights and liberties will be violated.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">This Bill is based on trust – we trust other member states and they trust us – and based on this, we should not concern ourselves with citizens being mistreated. If only the matter was this simple. The fact that member states have a different legal framework guarantees that this trust factor will not be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I turn first to the issue of dual criminality. Countries have different historical and cultural frameworks and democratically elected governments in the European Union have varied positions on what we describe as ethical issues. There is no clear consensus as to the acceptability or criminality of issues like euthanasia or abortion. A positive list of 32 offences set out in the Bill will not have to meet the requirements of dual criminality. The offences will have to have at least a three-year maximum sentence. The positive list has been criticised for being vague and could, therefore, be open to wide interpretation, with such conduct as "swindling" mentioned on the list.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">Murder is also named on the list and although we all agree that murder is a crime, it is important to note that one man's euthanasia is another man's murder. A cocktail of a wide variety of cultural and legal backgrounds in the European Union clearly shows that even the most obvious common ground does not stand up to close scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a fair trial, can be challenged in this debate. The application of Article 6 of the convention has been breached in some countries, many of which do not provide defendants with a right to trial by jury, while others allow trials <i>in absentia.</i> In some jurisdictions, it is not uncommon for judges to consent to the detention of suspects where there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution, but they proceed to do so in anticipation that evidence will turn up in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">It will be difficult to monitor other legal systems to ensure the right to a fair trial. Trust of other legal systems and accepting and recognising the decisions of each other's courts is not sufficient to ensure this right is not breached. Section 37 of the Bill refers to person convicted <i>in absentia,</i> which is worrying. The fact that a person cannot argue for a new trial on the grounds that he or she was inadequately represented at the previous trial is clearly wrong. In addition, there are no provisions allowing for an appeal against <i>in absentia</i> judgments. This problem is further exacerbated by the inconsistency of sentencing practice across Europe, which needs to be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Bill also raises questions concerning the issue of legal aid. The Bill states that a person may have a lawyer and, if necessary, an interpreter, as provided by the country in which the person has been arrested. Legal aid is dealt with differently by the member states. The right to legal representation is in accordance with the law of the member state, which varies from country to country. What guarantees do we have that legal aid will be consistent in each country and that a person convicted will receive equal representation across the board? Is that right also based on trust?</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The Green Party is also concerned about section 10 and the transmission of a European arrest warrant. There are provisions in the Bill for speeding up the transmission of a request through the Schengen information system. That system allows for an alert to be put on the system, thereby informing executing states of extradition orders. Under the Schengen regulations, the executing state can place a flag or a hold on this alert, thereby informing the issuing country that it will not arrest the person. However, the Bill will severely restrict the grounds for placing this flag.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">We are also concerned about the provisions in section 12 which relate to an arrest without warrant on grounds of urgency. This section is of most concern to us because a person can be arrested without a warrant for an offence where a Schengen alert has been reported. It is inevitable that people could be subjected to arbitrary arrest under such a system since no evidence of wrongdoing is necessary before the person is arrested.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Section 18 deals with the surrender of a person by an issuing state to another member state. We are concerned that the time limits do not make any allowance for decisions to be challenged in the European Court of Justice. The Green Party feels it is imperative to state in the Bill that there is an option to appeal to the European Court of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Section 29 should be amended to prohibit extradition to places where discrimination may take place due to other status and not just on the grounds listed. That is included in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Green Party recommends that membership of a trade union should be included under section 29(1)(<i>c</i>)(i), something which is already provided for in the Refugee Act 1996 under the definition of a convention refugee. This would ensure that those who are members of a trade union would be protected from discrimination. I remind the Minister about the case of Price <i>v.</i>UK Government where there was degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 because of the lack of facilities in a UK prison to deal with the special needs of a disabled woman. It would not be possible to extradite someone if jail conditions were in violation of Article 3 of the convention. I would also be interested to hear from the Minister about the provisions in the Bill to protect those with a severe mental illness from being treated less favourably.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The harsh reality is that different legal practices apply in each member state. There are no guarantees that a person arrested in Ireland to be tried in another country will have the same rights as those arrested in another country. There are too many inconsistencies in the legal frameworks which make up the EU states and trust is not enough. The arrest warrant has all the ingredients of a fast track process. The fact that Ireland was not consulted in advance about the contents of proposals for the European arrest warrant highlights that.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">In the 1980s there was considerable controversy in a number of highly political cases when the Supreme Court refused to extradite Irish citizens on the grounds that it was felt they might be subjected to mistreatment by the British authorities and not receive a fair trial. Today we are discussing a Bill which will greatly diminish the court's power to refuse an extradition request. The courts will be unable to rely on previous jurisprudence relating to extradition law and basic safeguards therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">When the arrest warrant was first proposed at the Tampere Summit in 1999, it was considered that a sufficient timeframe would be needed for legal systems to be harmonised. A period of ten to 12 years was proposed. However, after the events of 11 September, the draft was soon formatted and within three months it was agreed by 15 Governments. The Bill has all the ingredients of a knee-jerk reaction after 11 September. It is difficult to accept that the work of 12 years can be condensed into four.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">A short time ago the Minister publicly criticised Deputy John Bruton for supporting the erosion of Irish constitutional rights. It is ironic that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is introducing a Bill today which is a prime example of how our extradition laws have been rewritten behind our backs. However, the Government deserves some credit for raising principled objections to the framework decision at the final drafting stages. I hope the Government takes our concerns on board and ensures that our devotion to Europe is not allowed to compromise our basic freedom as Irish citizens.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I do not have a legal background, therefore, I may ask questions about the Bill. It is right that questions are raised about such a wide-ranging and technical Bill. Some people disagree with the concept of such an agreement and Bill. As regards what Deputy Finian McGrath said, I am not giving a moral or an ethical lecture to anyone. I have never done so and I hope I will not do so in the future. However, I will express my views on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The primary goal of the justice system is to protect all citizens. I want to ensure that everyone, including the elderly, those whose shops have been broken into and those who are vulnerable, are protected. It is easier and more popular to quote high profile cases than to pursue the rights of the citizens, which are disregarded night after night by different groups for different reasons. I will not lecture anyone, but I will defend the right to argue for justice in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Deputy Deasy spoke at length about the country's inability to defend itself. He referred to last week's newspaper article which stated that this country could be a soft target for international terrorism. Every country is a soft target. We saw that in Turkey and in countries which are supposed to have the greatest security systems in the world, such as the USA. We should realise that every country is a target. We will either fight against international terrorism or we will accept it and become a soft target. We are faced with options. The best defence is not arresting people in airplanes, but international co-operation among police forces and justice systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Those of us who were interested in preventing a drug epidemic 15 or 16 years ago received international briefings. We were made aware of the drug trafficking routes, etc. However, when an attempt was made to take appropriate action, civil liberties groups and others wanted to know what would happen to the farmers who grew the poppies and by what means their incomes would be supplemented. Everything went downhill from there. Now everyone is familiar with the problem and everyone knows what must be done. We must take action and the best way to do that is through co-operation. We have seen the need for that in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Deputy Costello was right when he expressed concern about the constitutional rights of our citizens. That is also true of other EU citizens who could be affected by such legislation. Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others were concerned about the lack of discussion on the topic. We have dealt with the issue of extradition more often and at greater length than any of our European partners. We had the same level of debate as those countries where the debate centred on extradition for war crimes. The debate on extradition was always highly emotive.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">We have debated that <i>ad nauseam.</i> Some of the Deputy's fears were adequately debated in the past, even if it was only in the Irish-British context. People who were not interested in or affected by this subject took an interest in it. There were debates on the issue and people got involved. The end result was that this country hammered out a process which was examined minutely to ensure it protected the individuals involved. We had quotes from the speaker from the Green Party about previous technical difficulties, but when speaking earlier the Minister said electronic traffic of warrants is permitted. Is that correct? We had a refusal on the basis of photocopies being used, which was ridiculous. I appreciate the concerns of other people who said the warrants could be tampered with, but is my original point correct?</p>
          <p eId="para_635">We have a duty to take every possible action to fight international crime, whether it is terrorism or any of the other crimes listed. We have failed to do that in many instances, primarily because of what is loosely described as the civil liberties argument. I have said on many occasions in the past that I have found none of these people concerned about the victims of crime. They are experts on high profile cases and the international situation, but when it comes to the mundane protection of the ordinary citizen they suddenly lose their voices, which concerns me. We cannot continue simply lamenting this and writing articles about it – we must be willing to fight it. It is easy to enter this Chamber for the purposes of lambasting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on what he has said about other issues, but this is a stand alone issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_662">They should have a simple layman's look at the Bill, although I do not want to over simplify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I see technical difficulties regarding interpreters. Is there a unit dealing with all requests for warrants, as there was disarray at the outset? Will that technical section need to be reinforced? We are speaking here of the need for a range of languages. We all know the difficulties that can arise, such as the case where the warrants were thrown out because photocopies were used. It is obvious that there was a language problem in that case. Can the Minister tell me if that has been provided for and how that section will be reinforced? That is one of the practical difficulties. Instead of arguing for civil rights, it may be as well to concentrate on that difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">One of the reasons set out in section 12 for not executing a warrant is when there is a question about the age of the person concerned in the application. I did not know there were such conditions. I know of cases that have been dismissed as a result of statements against a person who was too old or for various other reasons. However, I did not realise there was a specific definition regarding age in terms of applications. Can the Minister tell me if there is such a law or if it will be determined when the warrant is produced?</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Regarding rearrest, which was raised in the context of previous legislation, are there safeguards to protect the individual? If the warrant is issued or if the person is added to the list before the warrant is issued, particularly under the SIS, can they be held after the eight or ten day limit provided for before the warrant is supplied while further information is being sought? That was the position in the past. In other words, can they be held indefinitely or must they be released after a given time?</p>
          <p eId="para_666">A primary and practical concern is that the right to a fair trial can be prejudiced by the wrong publicity in the media. The media have been at fault in this, as in the past there have been rulings in at least one or two cases where the trial was prejudiced by the previous profile the case was given in the media. There is nothing more high profile than someone being extradited, as we witnessed in the past week. Is there any mechanism for protecting a person in such a case? Notoriety is synonymous with arrest and can cloud the judgment of a jury. Is there any ruling, such as exists in juvenile and family cases, whereby details may not be released?</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I appreciate the Minister has suggested he is going to deal with leaks from certain sources, but if somebody is exposed in a high profile case it could be prejudicial to their trial. I believe in the principle of a person being innocent until proven guilty.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The question of dual criminality has been covered already. Historically we have had difficulty with political offences, but it was eventually dealt with at length. I would like to hear more on this issue. Any offence that incurs a sentence of four months is categorised as serious, but this seems a very short sentence to include under the category of serious offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">We have failed to deal with this since 1957. We were probably dealing with other issues. People can argue for a tightening up of the process but those who say there should be no process at all concern me greatly. The whole thing has been going on far too long. We are all aware that international terrorism and crime know no boundaries – I am preaching to the converted. If we do nothing to counteract it by co-operating with the good guys against the bad guys then we are adding to the crime and aiding the criminals. It is no good for Deputy Finian McGrath to lecture me on the primary goal of the justice system if I refuse to do anything to prevent the crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">To return to technical matters, the Director of Public Prosecutions issues the warrants, which can be given to any court. Does that mean all warrants will go through the same source? I do not expect thousands of applications, but will the system be beefed up to cope with this? The Minister said it would be done by a central authority – will that be the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I appreciate the Minister's point that this is a mandatory action, although the argument has been made that there are other issues that have not been dealt with. Last Wednesday one of the questions asked was about the number of treaties and so on that Ireland had not yet implemented. There was significant criticism of the Government for this. Does Deputy Ó Snodaigh think he should be permitted to decide which we implement first? This is an attempt to deal with one of them so the next time the list will be shorter by one. We should keep the pressure on so that all other such legislation is implemented, whether they deal with social affairs, equality or anything else. We have delayed things too long. People should consider their own behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I had many questions about the legislation but most of them have been asked already and I am sure others will be asked later on. These questions concern the European Arrest Warrant, the International Criminal Court and so on. Some people talk about the European monolith. I am proud to be part of the European monolith.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I can remember the days when this country was dragged down primarily by the loss of our people. I was one of those who had to go. I did not have a safe, cushy job or somebody who could hand on the silver spoon. I had to go and I understand more than most what this is like. We have turned that around. When I say "We", I am talking particularly about the last two Governments. People may praise them – I do not mind. This country has turned itself around. There can be no argument about the primary reason for this, which is our membership of the European Union. If we want to criticise the EU we should recognise this fact. We may criticise parts of it but they are very few. It has instigated a massive amount of social legislation that we would not otherwise have. If we are to knock the EU we must give it the credit it deserves. I am quite happy to do that because the EU has brought us a long way.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I totally support the need for extradition of suspected criminals where there is evidence against them. The issues raised by various Deputies must be considered. They are legitimate concerns, although several of them have already been put to rest. It is to be hoped that process will continue. I commend the Bill to the House and hope it will be passed before another ten years has gone by.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_676">Like many other speakers I give more than a guarded welcome to the Bill because I understand the significance of what is being attempted, although many of my colleagues on all sides of the House have legitimate questions to ask about this legislation. As a result of our membership of the EU we have been able to integrate at a certain level the various cultures and lifestyles of millions of people. I do not mean, however, that individual countries do not have their own views and cultures. That is one of the reasons many people are worried about legislation such as this – something that is seen as absolutely normal in the Netherlands would not be normal here.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">There is a basic thread running through all this. People who terrorise the world and commit serious crimes at other people's expense – injuries, death, torture and so on – cannot be ignored. No one is arguing that we should stay outside this process. Over the years there has been reasonable integration within the European Union in many areas of life. This takes a long time to happen and we must be extraordinarily careful that we do not remove from people rights that are regarded as basic human rights in their own countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The list of 32 crimes includes terrorism, corruption, kidnapping, racketeering, rape, murder – one could not call it a list of virtues no matter how one looks at it. People within the EU decide to get involved in these crimes irrespective of their nationalities. They do much damage and inflict great pain at personal and national level. I am no expert but in my view we should stand up for natural justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Given the unique basic principle of the Treaty of Rome, involving the free movement of goods, people and so on within the EU, it might be expected to be much more difficult to control criminals at a certain level, particularly international criminals, than it has ever been before. That is how it is working out. Crimes are being perpetrated at the moment that could not previously have been imagined even by people like me who have been around for a long time. Those over 30 grew up in a world in which events such as those of 11 September 2001 or the bombing in Turkey a few weeks ago were completely unknown. Terrible atrocities were committed during wars but not in the civilian world. There is no doubt these crimes are perpetrated by gangs of organised criminals. One can argue until the cows come home about why they might do such things, but those who suffer from these crimes never have anything to do with what actually happened. One can clothe that conclusion in any legal language one likes but it is always true.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Deputy Costello's comments were interesting and he made sense.One wonders what input, regardless of what Minister is in office, this country had into this legislation. I know some Irish proposals and amendments were submitted in Brussels or in Strasbourg before the legislation arrived here for consideration. Was it a <i>fait accompli</i> handed down to us by the bigger states on the basis that it would suit Ireland? What sort of punch did we carry for those aspects of the legislation we did not like? A number of matters could raise serious doubts in people's minds. In the overall context, however, the Bill is right in its assertion that the key objective of the European Union is the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I have always been an advocate of the European Union and I have seen nothing in recent years to dissuade me from that position. It has its faults and there are occasions when our membership of the Union inflicts certain pain on us, but by and large it has been good. If one does not support the concept of this Bill, of what is one in favour? What are we arguing for? I would like the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to indicate how many other countries have already ratified this piece of legislation. How many countries have gone to the stage of bringing it to their national parliaments, as Ireland has? As with currency matters, is it possible that a few states will not ratify it, but for what reasons? Some states might want the contents of the Bill currently being considered by the Oireachtas watered down on the grounds that it is too draconian in their view. We were told many times in the past, particularly as regards currency matters, that every country had to follow the band. However, they did not, and the sun still shone the next day. I did not see the sky falling. It is against that background that I would ask the Minister of State, when replying, to give us some indication of what is happening elsewhere as I assume that is well known at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It is important from the viewpoint of the big bad world of criminality that our police force and judicial system is as much in tune as possible, across Europe and throughout the world. Sometimes it can be argued that we are isolated and that as an island nation we have a great many problems other states might not have. It is difficult for us to control our coastline, for instance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the importation of drugs and allied matters. We do relatively well but once one hears that a consignment of drugs has been detected, one may be sure at least four or five others have not. Everyone accepts that.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Some people ask what are the chances of a major hit on Ireland on a Richter scale of one to ten, the kind of atrocity that occurred in Istanbul the other day, for example. I have no idea. One wonders if anyone knows because it is a difficult question to evaluate. People wonder if the chances of a hit on Ireland are increased by the fact that we subscribe to this legislation. I do not believe that to be a reason for not passing the Bill. It is certain that if terrorists want to strike, they will strike. It would not be good to be isolated from the rest of Europe in that sense. Some connect the issue to neutrality. I cannot see the connection because what could potentially happen in any city in Europe could happen here as well. I do not believe such criminals would take the slightest notice of the word "neutrality" if it suited their purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">We are a small nation with limited resources in the overall scheme of things. It is up to the Government to ensure that the type of legislation we are accustomed to is adhered to. By and large we have performed well within our legal norms and we would like to think that where Irish nationals are involved in court cases or whatever, the same norms would apply. That is what this is about, the possible integration on a Europe-wide basis of the rules and regulations we accept as being normal. I have no idea whether or how quickly that can happen, but it is important to insert stringent precautions. In fairness to Members on both sides of the House that is why so many questions are being raised on this legislation. Many will be eager to hear the Minister of State's reply as they support something of this magnitude which affects so many people. No matter what we say about integration in Europe, nationalism still flourishes alongside individual cultures and so on. Many people will want to know just how strong are the safeguards to protect Irish national interests. The other member states will want to know how we would deal with matters here.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I have little knowledge of the technical issues involved. However, I recall the high profile cases of the early 1990s when people were being extradited from England to this jurisdiction. The smallest irregularity was sufficient to annul a warrant such as a photocopier not working correctly or whatever. Such matters made the gardaí and the judicial system look silly. The general response at the time was: "Why did you not get it right?" I sincerely hope, whatever arises from this legislation that extraditions are carried out properly. The above cases gave rise to a complete lack of confidence at that time in the State's ability to extradite anyone, from anywhere. In the context of this legislation I trust all matters of this kind will be resolved. The Bill is for the betterment of Europe and Ireland, but we will have to be careful.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_686">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, stated that the European Union is built on democratic principles and the rule of law. This is characterised by the free movement of persons, capital goods and services throughout the Union. It would be a fallacy not to recognise that it is also characterised by the free movement of criminals – international as well as Irish – throughout the European Union. I would hope some of that movement can be addressed through this legislation. While Fine Gael is broadly in favour of the legislation, the party has serious concerns about some of its provisions. I will indicate some of these in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There is currently a series of different extradition arrangements throughout the European Union, including the 1957 convention. There are special arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom where we have had a strong relationship for many years, particularly in regard to the extradition of terrorists from one side of the Irish Sea to the other. A similar arrangement is in place in both the Nordic and Benelux countries. I will return to the Benelux countries later.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The impression has been given that this is a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats initiative. It is not. The EU Council of Ministers came up with the proposals before us. They arise following the atrocities committed in the United States on 11 September 2001. They are concerned, in principle, with strengthening internal co-operation throughout the European Union. It is something we must recognise and take note of in light of the fact that we are now expanding the Union from its current size to 25 members. This substantial increase in the size of the Union will give criminals huge opportunities to move across state borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The European arrest warrant seeks to simplify procedures for the surrender of wanted persons by replacing the inter-state aspects of extradition with an inter-courts system. The warrant will take the form of a court decision in one member state addressed to a court in another member state for the purposes of conducting the execution of a custodial sentence in the issuing member state. It applies to all offences having a penalty of more than 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">People are currently trying to avoid prosecution by leaving this State. Following the death of Veronica Guerin, we all recall the exodus of many drug lords who left the country to avoid prosecution. Many of them are still at large. Will the legislation ensure that some of them will be brought home and made accountable? Given that the Minister of State comes from the crime capital of Ireland, the city of Limerick, if some of his constituents were to do a runner out of the State, can they be tracked down, brought back here and prosecuted under the legislation? Many parts of his city are becoming no-go areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_402" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. O'Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_691">That is not true. Limerick is not the crime capital of Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_692">The Minister of State will have an opportunity to respond later. Under the legislation, the dual criminality requirement is being watered down. Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on the types of protection being put in place to deal with crimes such as hijacking, terrorism, murder, arson, money laundering, proceeds of crime, child pornography, firearms and explosives offences and illicit trafficking of drugs, radioactive material and in human beings.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">An article in one of today's national newspapers reported on a woman who was extradited back to Ireland from the UK five years after making a rape allegation against a man in this country. She was subsequently given a sentence, which I will not go into. Under the proposed legislation, can such an individual be extradited back to the State from any other European country? As rape is a very serious allegation, where it can be substantiated, every effort should be made to secure a prosecution. On the other hand, where someone makes a false allegation, the same effort must be made to ensure those responsible are prosecuted so that there is a balance in the way the current statute deals with people, regardless of whether they have committed an offence or falsely alleged a serious offence was perpetrated. The Government and the governments of the other 14 member states of the European Union believe rape is a very serious offence, therefore, it is imperative that protections are in place where false allegations are made. Will the current arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom be extended throughout the whole of the European Union?</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on the issue of dual criminality in respect of political offences. The definition of a political offence has been a controversial issue in the past. Does the legislation cover organisations such as ETA, the Real IRA and al-Qaeda? These are all terrorist organisations, and must be treated as such. I hope that under the legislation the three organisations will be treated equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I want to raise an issue regarding the DPP because I understand he will issue warrants. Under current legislation, the DPP cannot provide an explanation in a case where a warrant is not issued or where a prosecution does not take place. This issue should be considered in the context of either this or future legislation. There should be a mechanism available whereby the DPP can provide an explanation to the public, or to individuals, as to why a particular prosecution did not take place. This would improve transparency in the law and ensure that the majority of the public would respect the decision of the DPP and understand the reason he took a decision not to prosecute or, in this instance, made a decision not to issue a European arrest warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I have concerns about the legislation. In some European countries a person can be tried initially <i>in absentia.</i> Part 3 of the Bill provides guarantees in regard to retrial. However, the Bill raises concerns about the way court proceedings take place in Ireland compared to other European countries. We do not have that difficulty at present in regard to the United Kingdom because our legal system is very similar to the system in place there. Perhaps, sometimes, the UK authorities could take lessons from the way we have structured our legislation. Things are differently structured on the Continent of Europe, where someone can be prosecuted <i>in abstentia</i> and found guilty. This raises concerns in Ireland where we do not have a similar situation. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I understand that under the legislation the Minister will perform the central authority functions, that is, the administrative receipt and issuing of European arrest warrants, as well as all other communications with other member states relating to such warrants. Will the Minister be accountable and answerable to the House if there are delays in either issuing warrants to some or all European countries, or in receipt of a warrant and the circulation of it to the Garda Síochána? The difficulty is that each time legislation is introduced here there appears to be less accountability to the House. The power of the House is being watered down on a daily basis. I hope that element of accountability is provided for in the legislation and that there will not be a dilution of the power and responsibility of the House to question the Minister on procedural and administrative matters regarding European arrest warrants. It is imperative that the protection exists so that we can question the Minister and make him or her accountable to the House. Section 4 defines corresponding offences. An issue that continually arises is that of road traffic offences, the majority of which do not carry a sentence greater than 12 months but some of which do. Will the Minister elaborate on the penalty points system? Under the current system, penalty points are attached to a driver's licence in the South whereas, if he or she goes to the North, they are not, and <i>vice versa</i> for a person travelling from the North to the Republic. If a person from Belfast drives on to the M50, continues to Cork and returns the next morning having collected six penalty points on the outward journey and six on the return journey, that raises serious questions on the need for a reciprocal arrangement across the Border with Northern Ireland. It is making a farce of the system otherwise. The most dangerous motorway in the country is the Dublin-Belfast motorway. The most dangerous counties on which to drive on Irish roads are the Border counties. That is due mainly to Northern drivers coming across the Border who do not respect the road traffic legislation in this jurisdiction because they know they cannot be caught.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The Minister for Transport has discussed this matter with his counterparts in Northern Ireland but we have seen no action. I hope there will be some movement on this issue. It makes a farce of the penalty points system in this jurisdiction if we cannot have a reciprocal arrangement with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and the UK from where the majority of foreign drivers come. It is the only place from which foreign drivers come. According to the figures available to me, 12% of all accidents here involve a foreign driver. That is not to say 12% of accidents are caused by foreign drivers, but they involve them. This is an issue we need to examine. Given that the number of accidents involving the Irish driving population is being reduced due to the penalty points system, the number of accidents will probably increase due to the increase in the number of foreign drivers. I define foreign drivers as drivers from outside Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, so they are mainly continental and US drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has examined this issue and produced a report in October 2003, one of the recommendations of which provides for a system whereby authorities in the driver's home jurisdiction may be notified of offences committed in another jurisdiction. Given that this legislation is before the House, consideration should be given to putting in place a reciprocal arrangement. When this or similar issues are being discussed at European level during the next six months, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform ensure a reciprocal arrangement is put in place? It could be linked in similar to the mechanism being put in place for the European arrest warrants whereby notices are circulated to other member states. Surely a similar mechanism can be put in place for the penalty points system. There are drivers here who hold dual driving licences, namely, from the Republic and the UK. Even though they are both supposed to be European driving licences it means they can avoid attaching penalty points because they use the UK licence rather than their Irish licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I wish to raise the issue of drug driving. With effect from January next year, the British Government is introducing a drugalyser test which, I understand, will include Northern Ireland. This means a person can be stopped and tested for exceeding the legal limit in respect of legal or illegal drugs. What happens if a person is guilty of an offence, whether from the Republic or Northern Ireland, and comes across the Border to avoid prosecution? In the event that a person from the Republic who is on medication travels to the North and is unaware that a new system is in place there and he or she is exceeding the legal limit or that a legal limit is involved, a penalty similar to that which applies here for drink driving should apply in the North where a person can be prosecuted and serve a jail sentence as well as being banned from driving. Under the provisions of this legislation, can a person be transferred across the Border? Perhaps some of these issues could be examined when Ireland assumes the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Part 4, section 39, proposes to amend the 1965 Act. This will enable amended arrangements to be put in place with the United Kingdom in respect of territories not covered by the European arrest warrant, for example, the Isle of Man. What is the position with other EU territories outside the United Kingdom? Will they covered under the proposed amendment? Is it the case that criminals who wish to avoid prosecution can go to some of these EU territories? They have free movement in and out of those territories. Can they be extradited from those territories back to Ireland to face prosecution?</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I wish to follow up on a point raised by Deputy Connaughton concerning the draconian transposition of EU directives into Irish law. We are very eager to implement the letter of the law when it comes to EU directives and legislation. We try to cover all eventualities and it is a belt and braces approach whereas continental Europe has always taken a minimalist approach. Will the Minister give a guarantee that the approach being adopted here is exactly the same as that being adopted in the other 15 member states? We do not want to end up with legislation that is far more prescriptive than the legislation in France or many other European countries. If that is the case what is the value of the legislation before the House? Is it being introduced on the basis of what we need to do or is it the belt and braces approach that has been taken to date by Ireland on all EU directives? I would appreciate clarification of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Deputy Connaughton raised the probability of an incident in Ireland similar to that which occurred in Istanbul. Neutrality is a fallacy here because we do not have the ability to defend ourselves. It would be useful to have a more comprehensive debate on that to deal with citizens' concerns on the defence and security of the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">We all agree it is necessary to take the action to prevent international terrorism, that goes without saying. The atrocities of 11 September 2001 and other acts since emphasise the need for peace loving countries to take whatever action is necessary to protect themselves, their people and democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Having said that, we must be careful. If we introduce legislation that brings the law into disrepute, people will say that if we had taken more time and examined the issue carefully, we might have seen the problem. I am not happy that legislation with 41 sections should go through the House in a few hours. That is not the way to do business and, invariably, we will come to regret it. The Minister will say that we have time to deal with the sections of the Bill but when legislation is rushed, problems arise. The deadline for the enactment of this Bill is 4 January but that should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The events of 11 September were horrendous but, in their aftermath, we should look at what is happening in Guantanamo Bay, where people are being wrongfully detained. I was involved with others in this House in the campaigns to free the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and other victims of miscarriages of justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">While it was generally accepted that doubts existed about the guilt of the people in prison, it was only after long campaigns that it was possible to see that justice was eventually done. In those circumstances, particularly in the case of Annie Maguire, there were glaring breaches in the normal procedures and, as a result, things went wrong and were not corrected for considerable time, 14 years in the case of the Guildford Four.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I am most worried by section 12, which provides for the arrest of a person without a warrant when the warrant is in preparation in another jurisdiction. The Minister of State is an expert on constitutional law, and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is an expert in all law, civil and constitutional.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">If he were here now I would engage with him about some of his acrylic references this morning. In the preparation of warrants, however, we must be certain the legislation is used for the purposes for which it is intended. Those who are powerful and influential, such as the drug barons, have vast resources to protect themselves, but an innocent individual with no influence or resources is not in the position to deal with such a situation. The Minister of State knows that in such circumstances we must ask if we are certain that the legislation, necessary as it is, will not be used against innocent people who are then suddenly taken away from this or another jurisdiction and dealt with in a fashion that would not be in accordance with the rules here. We should make provision for such circumstances. We have all experienced occasions where the validity of a warrant or action taken on foot thereof can be questioned. It is important that the legislation we pass is not held up to ridicule by virtue of a loophole leading to abuse and brings us into disrepute. The constitutional rights of the victims of all atrocities are important and, equally, the constitutional rights of an innocent person who might be wrongfully accused are important. We must be careful.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Section 12 provides that the gardaí may arrest a person without a warrant where a Schengen alert has been issued on the Schengen information system and the gardaí have reasonable grounds to believe that the person is likely to leave the State before the European arrest warrant is received. Deputy Connaughton referred to the difficulties that arose in this State as a result of photocopies of warrants and warrants that were not authenticated by the courts, events we all remember.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Minister should ensure that these warrants are used against the drug barons and organised crime gangs who have left the country, are operating freely outside of it and directing their operations here from their havens abroad. They must be brought home to answer for their crimes and there must be no possibility of mistakes with warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">This measure is being introduced is to deal with serious crime, not technical offences, and should be used against serious criminals. There is a feeling that serious criminals can get away with their actions because they have the power and influence to raise two fingers to the law and the people but that minor offences committed by those with little or no influence are punished readily and severely.</p>

The Minister said this morning that he will propose amendments on Committee Stage. Most of those will be technical in nature to clarify certain provisions in the Bill. They should also address some of the issues that have arisen in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Deputies Connaughton and Costello asked what input we had into the European agreement. The agreement had to be adopted unanimously by all EU member states. We studied it in detail and agreed to adopt it on two conditions, that it was debated in the Oireachtas and that the Bill would contain a provision whereby a person could not be removed from the country just to be investigated. The person has to be charged or be someone on whom a prison sentence has been imposed and who is then taken out to serve that sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Deputy Connaughton, Deputy Costello and others asked how many countries have signed up to this agreement. To date, four countries have ratified the agreement: the United Kingdom, Denmark, Portugal and Spain. The following countries are expected to meet the deadline of 4 January 2004: Ireland, Greece, Sweden, Finland and Belgium.
