#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh.A report published by a financial consultant last week showed that house prices in Dublin have become so exorbitant that the average public servant — a teacher, garda, nurse or other public servant — cannot afford to buy a house there.  Most young public servants now have to live 40 or 50 miles from the city.  Does the Government have a view on the scheme that has been in place in the United Kingdom for the past 15 years?  I refer to the London weighting system, whereby public servants who live in the capital city and have to buy a house there are given an additional allowance with their pay as a means of helping them to afford a mortgage.  There would be some merit in a proposal to establish a Dublin weighting system, whereby additional support would be given to public servants who work in a range of areas to enable them to purchase a home in this city.  If we do not take some action in this regard, public servants will continue to be unable to buy houses in Dublin.  Some imaginative and innovative proposals are needed if we are to address this problem.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The final point made by Senator Brian Hayes, which was important, brings me to the point I wanted to raise.  Is the Leader prepared to arrange an open discussion in this House on the operation of the free market?  I was flabbergasted yesterday to hear two decent people — Senator Leyden and a Fine Gael Senator — arguing that the decision to cut off Smart Telecom's customers was appalling, unfair and should not have been allowed to happen.  They said the Government should intervene.  I thought we had that debate five or six years ago, when Eircom was privatised.  Perhaps the Minister can explain it further.  We knew what was going to happen.  We explained to people that there would not be broadband in Belmullet and that they could not expect to get any additional help from the State.  I would like Members to understand that those who invest in Babcock & Brown by buying shares in that company — the investors could be from anywhere — do not really care whether a small business in south Dublin or a domestic household in Athlone will suddenly lose their service.  That is what it is about.  I would say that it is close to hypocrisy if I did not know that those who raised the issue yesterday did so with the best of intentions.  I do not accuse them of that at all.  We need to understand how the system works.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	34	That is right.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	35	When Aer Lingus is privatised, it will do a Michael O'Leary on it from here on in.  We should not be upset by that because that is the way it will go.I assure Senator Brian Hayes, who spoke about the price of houses, that if somebody manages to reduce the price of houses there will be an outcry from the main political parties.  If somebody manages to get extra money for decent public servants who could do with it to help them to buy houses, as Senator Hayes has suggested, we all know the money will end up in the hands of the same developers and builders who are getting all the money at present.  I have made those points, but I do not want to go further with them.  It would be useful if those who support the market in one instance recognise their support will have outcomes and consequences at a later stage.  It is difficult to listen to people who enthusiastically and energetically supported certain decisions in the first instance now complaining about the negative fall-out from those decisions.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	45	It is a wonder the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform got so animated and emotional on national television last Thursday evening about the £8,000 the Taoiseach received in Manchester, whereas he rejected out of hand yesterday the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which clearly states the Government paid almost twice the market value when buying 150 acres of land at Thornton Hall as the site of the prison that will replace Mountjoy Prison.  Where is the value for money for taxpayers in the latter instance?  The Tánaiste needs to come to the House to explain how such a squandering of money can be justified.  How can he spend €30 million on land that is worth just half of that amount?  I am talking about the same man who was annoyed, emotional and upset last Thursday evening when he was asked about £8,000 that was received in Manchester.I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to come to this House to discuss local government.  The Minister has arranged to meet Whips in recent times to speak about the service given to Members of the Oireachtas by local authorities.  I am not certain how the service works in most other counties, but I find it to be increasingly inefficient.  I have to wait for replies from county managers and directors of services.  I understand a great deal of money is being wasted on using Oireachtas facilities, such as e-mails and faxes, to contact people who are blatantly taking advantage of the fact that Members of the Oireachtas are no longer members of local authorities.  Such people do not have to bump into us as often as they used to.  The service we are getting has not improved.  During the debate in this House on the abolition of the dual mandate, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, gave a very clear commitment that Members of the Oireachtas would enjoy the same level of service after the abolition of the dual mandate as they enjoyed when they were members of local authorities.  I cannot say that has happened, certainly in the cases of some of the officials with whom I have to deal.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Roche, to come to the House to explain his plan, which was publicised in the media in recent times, to allow Members of the Oireachtas to attend special sittings of local authorities and to get a better service from local authority officials.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Minister for Transport announced last week, after much debate and public comment, that he intends to publish legislation, which will come to this House in time, establishing the Dublin transportation authority.  He mentioned during his announcement of the reform of Dublin Bus that the new authority will have the power to dispense the State subsidy that is given to Dublin Bus and to monitor all the routes used by private and public operators of transport services.  He also announced that Dublin Bus will get 100 buses and Bus Éireann will get 160 buses.  More importantly, he pointed out that the Dublin transportation authority, upon its establishment, will introduce 100 private sector buses to the Dublin bus transport market.  I would like the House to debate the establishment of the new authority and to discuss the powers it will have.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the legislation I mentioned to be brought to the House in this term.

As Senator O'Toole said, people should not be surprised by the attitude and approach being taken by Babcock & Brown in this regard.  I am surprised by another aspect of the matter, however.  Regulators have been established across a wide basis.  As I understand it, regulators insulate Ministers against criticism about various issues.  In this instance, it seems the regulator was warned four weeks ago about what was likely to happen with Smart Telecom.  In the past two years ComReg has had ongoing arguments with Eircom on opening up the telecommunications market.  The regulator has failed.  The events with Smart Telecom will lead to its dismantling and its customers will return to using Eircom.  Rather than liberalising the marketplace, it has had the opposite effect.  It shows the weakness of the telecommunications structure that there has been no success in unbundling the local loop and opening up the market.  People have made massive moneys out of the privatisation of Eircom.  Have consumers got better value?  It is questionable that they have.

As reported in The Irish Times and the Irish Independent, this ruling stated length of service is a good enough reason to pay one employee more than another, even if they are doing the same job.  In practice, women who take time off to care for their children can end up earning thousands of euro less than their colleagues when they return to work.  Too often women are held back in their careers because they rightly put the care of their children first.  I will publish in autumn my report on a new approach to child care which highlights the importance of parental involvement in early childhood care.  I suggest several ways to help balance work with family life.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The European Court of Justice ruling also discourages fathers from taking time off work to care for their children as they could end up falling behind their colleagues in the pay stakes.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must come before the House to discuss legislation that will guarantee that parents who put their children first are rewarded and not punished.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I want to raise the same issue as Senator White.  We share many interests.  The decision of the European Court of Justice is a serious blow for women.  A woman must take time off work to spend at least three months with her baby.  We have fought for extended maternity and parental leave.  In taking maternity leave, women will be discriminated in the workplace on the grounds that their length of service is less than that of their male colleagues.  It also discriminates against fathers who wish to take time off to spend with their children as they are growing up.  This is retrograde step and one which will have serious consequences for many women and parents.  The European Court of Justice took a narrow and discriminatory view when it focused on length of service.  What about equal pay for equal work?The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must inform the House on how they can address this issue.  Will unscrupulous employers discriminate against women because they must take time off to be with their children?  Will the Leader organise a debate on this serious matter as soon as possible?
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I call for a debate on migration, immigration and integration in light of a high level conference held on the matter in the UN and two reports from the National Economic and Social Council.  The ESRI recently pronounced that workers from Romania and Bulgaria should be banned from Ireland or at least limited in the numbers who can come here.  A Gallup poll conducted in September in Bulgaria showed that of 36,000 Bulgarians who wanted to work abroad, only 550 wanted to come to Ireland.  We have not much to fear of the Bulgarians swamping us.  It is a good subject for a debate.Yesterday's ruling by the European Court of Justice was appalling and incredible.  After all the progress that has been made in women's rights, this is retrograde step.The Leader of the Opposition raised the issue of Senator Norris's Civil Partnership Bill.  The Oireachtas must legislate for contentious and divisive issues.  If we do not, we will be handing over the ruling of the State to the courts.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Not unnaturally I agree with part of what Senator Lydon has said.  Although I have been long a supporter of women's rights, I do not see the European Court of Justice ruling as a women's rights issue.  What we have heard in the Chamber this morning is political correctness gone utterly mad.  The debate should be on length of service and not on an aspect of discrimination.  If one accepts length of service as a criteria, then it is ludicrous to reward people for not being at work.  I never heard anything so bizarre in my life.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	What about equal pay for an equal job?

Of course women must take time off work to have children.  What is also being considered is taking a year off for child-rearing.  Why should employers be required to pay on the basis of experience that is simply not there?

As somebody who has supported women's rights all my political life, I will be happy to bring some plain common sense to it when it takes place.  When one gets into political correctness, one is on a sticky wicket.I support my colleague Senator Quinn, who raised the important issue of how urban sprawl affects this city.  I will pass a bouquet to the other side, however, by pointing to the conference, A New Heart for Dublin, organised by Senator Morrissey, a Government Member, for 20 October in Dublin Castle.  I hope Members who are concerned about this issue will attend and I congratulate Senator Morrissey on this initiative.I applaud the Taoiseach for the extraordinary neatness with which he arranged the money in his sock.  If it were me, I would probably have ended up with £47,579.14 and a halfpenny.  The Taoiseach, however, managed to achieve the target of €50,000 exactly and put it in the sock.  This was well done.  It is the type of financial credibility that has made this country great.

I hope it will be thoroughly investigated and those responsible brought to account.My final point relates to Babcock and Brown, Eircom and so on.  Consumers are getting a lousy deal.  We must all do something about this, including Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, which was effective on ground rent and in getting rid of landlordism.  Why are we still paying rental money to Australia, France and pension funds all over the world for lines put in by this State, paid for by us and itemised in every telephone bill we receive?  We must eradicate landlordism in the telecommunications business by putting an end to line rent.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I support calls for a debate on local government reform, particularly in regard to the provision of housing.  A considerable number of people are repaying local authority loans which were taken out in the 1970s and 1980s at interest rates up to 11% or 12% over 25 or 30 years.  There should be a major information campaign to inform such persons that they can remortgage at lower rates and for a shorter period with the financial institutions.  I have just discovered that in County Galway alone, for instance, 500 people are still paying off local authority housing loans at those high rates over 30 years.I hope we can include this issue in the debate on local government reform.  I understand these loans also include mortgage protection policies which cover only the principal earner, even though there may be two names, for example, a husband and wife, on the policy.  This is an issue I have raised with the Director of Consumer Affairs and I will come back to the House when I get a reply.  It is most unfair that policies which  benefit only the principal earner are included in these loan arrangements.  Moreover, I understand the policy is dead if the person is more than 70 years of age.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Senator O'Toole asked yesterday about No. 12 on the Order Paper, the Privacy Bill 2006, but I understand he was more concerned with it being abolished rather than when it will be taken.  No. 11 is the Defamation Bill 2006, which is ordered for this session.  When does the Leader believe this will be taken?In the past several days, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has referred to the outrageous cases of invalidation of planning applications in different local authority areas.  It has described some of the authorities as dysfunctional in this regard.  There are allegations that applications were invalidated because site notices were the wrong colour, for example, or the application form, though provided by the relevant council, was out of date.  This points to a crazy situation.No. 24 is the resumption of statements on planning and related issues.  Will the Leader bring forward this debate and ask the Minister to come to the House?  May those of us who have already contributed to this debate be allowed do so again?  This is a serious matter and all of us agree that uniformity in these matters should be in evidence nationally.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I have already called for a debate on prices and other consumer issues and ask the Leader again to consider such a debate.

This is a major change.

There is no point in encouraging the privatisation of public utilities only to complain when they fail and, worse still, expect the taxpayer to reimburse those who invested in them.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, proposes to build private hospitals adjacent to public ones on public land.  This scheme has not been discussed in either House but the contracts for construction are currently out for tender.  What will happen if these private hospitals fail, as similar facilities have done all over the world?  Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Health and Children to discuss this extremely important issue?

I understand it will report remarkable progress in terms of people separating themselves, albeit belatedly, from criminal and other activity.  It is encouraging to see people delivering on their undertakings.  I hope this proves sufficient for the Democratic Unionist Party to move the process along.I support Senator Brian Hayes on the issue of the inability of people who are required to work in cities to live in those cities.  The report states that, in this respect, every city except Limerick is too expensive.  We must find a way to accommodate in their city of employment gardaí, municipal workers and others essential to the working of that city.  I look forward to a debate on this matter.

I also ask the Leader to organise a debate on measures that must be taken to address the issue of radon gas.

I would like a debate on the following issue with the appropriate Ministers present.Two members of the Oireachtas received confidential information on certain events in Donegal.  They put this information in the public domain as a matter of public interest and a tribunal insisted they reveal their sources, which they were reluctant to do.  The matter went to the courts where it was ordered that they reveal their sources and they were compelled to comply.A newspaper also received an order from a tribunal to reveal its sources of information.  The newspaper destroyed the evidence and refused to give the information on the basis that its priority was the protection of its sources.  I understood the priority was to obey the law.Does the media enjoy a superior position under the law than members of the Oireachtas, who have a mandate from the people to act on their behalf?  Newspapers have no mandate from the people.  I consider this issue relevant to the status and responsibilities of the Houses of the Oireachtas and would like to see it debated very soon.

However, Ireland West Airport, Knock, has seen corporate bullying go too far.  Ryanair opened a successful route between Knock Airport and Stansted Airport and easyJet opened an equally successful route between Knock Airport and Gatwick Airport.  Ryanair then opened a route between Knock and Gatwick in competition with easyJet which forced the latter out of the market.  Ryanair then stopped its service between Knock and Gatwick.On this occasion Ryanair has overstepped the mark.  What can we do, as legislators, against corporate bullying?  If Ryanair continues to function in this fashion we will find balanced regional development difficult, especially in and around Knock Airport.  Should the Competition Authority be involved?  Can we legislate to ensure this does not happen again?

If a politician had broken a court order and destroyed evidence, what kind of mayhem would have been created by the media?  I recognise that sometimes the media can create its own mayhem, a storm in a thimble, but, regardless, this is a serious issue.

The difficulties facing Smart Telecom have been mentioned in this House this morning and I would like to see other problems included in the debate.Last Saturday week thunder storms in my area caused Perlico customers to lose telephone services.  Since then businesses and residences have been unconnected, without telephone lines and broadband.  As Senator O'Toole pointed out, one is likely to have trouble with picture quality if one does not get a television and aerial from the same company.That a person, in this day and age, can be without a telephone line for ten days is a serious issue that needs to addressed.  Up to last night services had not been restored and I support the call for a debate on this matter.

It has not been published yet, but initial soundings in Northern Ireland suggest it will be a positive step forward.This House must keep a sharp eye on the deadline of 24 November and the prize is to get the institutions up and running again.  We must do anything we can in our jurisdiction to assist in this process, therefore, I call for a debate on Northern Ireland prior to the deadline.  This debate should relate not only to the institutions but to the wider prize of benefits for border areas and the rest of the country.I ask for the Leader's intervention on quota restrictions that are to be placed on the pelagic fleet.  We have 23 vessels and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has indicated that these restrictions will apply for the autumn period.  This is dangerous and would mean the vessels might not be allowed to fish for this period.  Already a major Donegal crab boat fishes out of Holland which means the ports, such as Greencastle, Killybegs and Downings Harbour, lose out on ancillary benefits.  Small industries and small shopkeepers are losing out and the benefits are being lost to other ports.  We must focus on this matter and I ask for the Leader's intervention.

No matter what one said and regardless of whether one prostrated oneself on the floor or flew to heaven, somebody would keep pursuing a particular point.  That involves a never-ending quest.I know people are becoming quite fed up with the whole matter.  The Senator knows well that we have all received phone calls thereon, not all of which were from supporters.  I received phone calls from people quite early this morning and later with a view to telling people to stop pursuing the issue.  I do not know why the Opposition is continuing in this regard.  It is like a dog with a very bad bone that——

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Has the Senator seen a copy of it?

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I have no sources at all.  I am just saying we should wait until there are many more revelations.  One will find we are not shouting and roaring and following bones with the same acuity as the Opposition.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	It is an expensive bone.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Senator Brian Hayes also raised the relevant matter of house prices.  He stated middle-income earners who must live in London city for the sake of their jobs receive a special allowance to help them to afford a mortgage.  I do not know if that is being considered in Ireland.  All the Senators have sought a debate on housing and we will endeavour to have one.Senator O'Toole was amazed at how we do not seem to understand how the free market works and stressed that if one opts for privatisation, issues such as that concerning Smart Telecom, which was mentioned yesterday and which continues to feature, will arise.  He was correct.  I heard Isolde Goggin, the telecommunications regulator, on the radio this morning and noted that she was trying to broker an arrangement.  However, the companies in question operate in a free market and in free markets people pay their commercial bills.  One must and that is one of the issues.  The Senator also raised the matter of housing, and we must therefore have a debate on it.It is very interesting that Babcock & Brown, on which great odium is being heaped, has a very worthy and ethical person as its lobbyist, Mr. Alan Dukes.  He is a very good person.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Regardless of whether the Senator or others like him or not, his name should not be mentioned.  He is not present in the House.  The Leader should continue.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Senator O'Rourke did not reveal any name last week.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	144	That is for another day.  Senator McCarthy has an outstanding question concerning where the Taoiseach put his money.  We could well ask where the Senator puts his.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I did not have £50,000 in 1989.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I feel this constant baiting is leading nowhere and I guess Senator McCarthy's heart was not in it.  The Senator asked about the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the new prison site.  I understand that matter will be debated by the Committee of Public Accounts and any Senator is entitled to attend.The Senator wondered if there is a proper way in which Oireachtas Members can have matters dealt with by local authorities.  The treatment they receive seems to range from very good to awful and the system should be regularised.  It is all very well that we have a very good system in Westmeath, as Senator Glynn will confirm, but it seems this is not the case in many other local authority areas.  We will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address this when he is before the House.Senator Morrissey raised a matter last week but I discovered on poring over my notes afterwards that I did not reply to him.  I apologise to him for this.  The Senator referred to the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority and asked if the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, could attend to have a pre-legislation discussion on the authority.  This would be very good.  The Senator also referred to the buses for Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and the private sector, which will be given.Senator Finucane stated the telecommunications regulator was endeavouring to speak to the various parties in the Smart Telecom dispute, which must behave in a commercial manner.Senator Mansergh would like a pre-budget debate on finance and the economy.  When he spoke about the Dark Ages, I imagine he spoke in metaphorical terms.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I would never have imagined that.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Senator Quinn mentioned urban sprawl and stated the European Environment Agency is to issue its report on this matter shortly.  He also referred to second level education, about which, commendably, the ASTI is writing to relevant parties.  The Minister, I hope, will take heed of this.Senator White referred to the ruling of the European Court of Justice.  I would like a very full explanation of that ruling because, from what I read today, it appears Senator White and Senator Terry are correct.  We might be missing something about the ruling and we should have a proper debate on it to discover its exact nature.  The old canard is still true, that is, women, because hormones are at work, want to have babies and must take time off to have them and care for them.  This also applies to fathers where there is joint parental care.  If women are to be penalised for having children or if men who wish to adopt the parental role in a more firm way are to be penalised, we should address the matter.  It is a question of ensuring social order in society.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	149	That is correct.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Senator Terry referred to the finding of the European Court of Justice.  I do not know if it is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, because the latter has responsibility for equality, but we will try to cut through this and find out.  I agree with Senator Terry and Senator White on the matter and it is amazing that it still takes women to address the issue publicly.Senator Lydon called for a debate on migration and stated that only 550 Bulgarians wish to come here, despite all our fears of being swamped.  He stated, in a very robust way, that we should attack the civil partnership legislation ourselves rather than wait until the European Court of Justice makes a ruling.Senator Norris wants plain common sense to apply to rulings such as those that come from Europe.  If I may say so, he did not make his case very well.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I am leaving it for the debate and I am happy to do so.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Senator Norris signalled the forum in Dublin Castle, A New Heart for Dublin, arranged by Senator Morrissey.  Well done to Senator Morrissey.Senator Norris also referred to the sinister attempt to undermine the Taoiseach by sending forged letters to the tribunal, and he made this point very forcefully.Senator Kitt called for a debate on local government and housing.  Once upon a time, a long-term loan from a local authority was the prize thing to have, but times have now changed and interest rates have decreased.  However, we simply must have a debate on housing.Senator Coghlan asked about the defamation Bill.  All that I can tell him in that regard is that I have been told it is intended for this session.  He spoke of the validation of planning applications, which is a major issue.  When a couple or single person submits a planning application, it can be three or four weeks before the validation notice is issued.  The whole thing starts to move only after validation, adding to the time involved.  The Senator asked for No. 24, statements on planning and related issues, to be resumed.Senator Leyden contended that ESB charges should now be reduced because of the falling oil price.  However, one must remember that some supply contracts are historic.  He also dealt with certain other matters.  Senator Henry raised the question of the Minister for Health and Children's plans to build private hospitals on public land and asked if we might discuss the issue.  We are endeavouring to get hold of the Minister for Health and Children among others.  Like me, Senator Bannon wished to discuss the Abbeylara report, but it is a matter of prevailing upon the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is involved in legislation in the other House, to attend.Senator Maurice Hayes asked that we discuss the IMC report once it has been issued as part of a general Northern debate.  On the matter of middle-income earners being penalised and allowances for living in cities, Senator Bannon gave a fine speech about the Progressive Democrats.  He has one in his own area now, and I am sure she will show great gusto in dealing with him.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	157	And with Senator O'Rourke.  I suspect Senator Bannon is not alone.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I see Senator Bannon now chooses to sit in the section for university Senators.In any case, he seeks a debate on radon gas.  However, a large-scale programme of grants in that regard is already in operation.  He would want to attend to that.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Have you co-operated with the gardaí?

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	163	That indicates that the Senator has made a statement.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Order, please.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Senator Ó Murchú raised the issue of two Members, one from this House and one from the other, who had to obey the law by revealing the source of their information, asking why that same law does not apply to journalists.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	166	It does apply to journalists.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I suspect the Bills will have something to say on that.Senator Feighan brought up what he called corporate bullying, asking how a route to Gatwick initiated by easyJet could be purloined by another airline that went on to drop it. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.  Nothing changes, and that type of carry-on remains a feature.  We have spoken much of the free market today, and it is true such behaviour is part of it.  I know such incidents have happened before.Senator Hanafin mentioned the hue and cry in the newspapers, agreeing with Senator Ó Murchú.  Senator Coonan supported Senator O'Toole, speaking of a certain telephone service that had not been restored.  I wish that Perlico would stop ringing people.  Representatives from another group — I believe called Gaelic Telecom — have now also begun doing so.  They want one to change one's telephone service.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Say nothing about that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Please pass no comment on that.  We are not entitled to do so, since it is not in order.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	170	In any event, I did not hear them out.Senator McHugh brings a distinctive northern voice to matters raised here.  He spoke of the quota restrictions, particularly on pelagic fish, and their effect on Greencastle and other ports in his area.  Perhaps we might have a word on the matter.  I am sure the fishing organisations have made a robust case, but I thank the Senator for raising the issue.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	171	What is the Government view on Private Members' motion No. 9.  Will it oppose it?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	172	At our party meeting yesterday, Senators unanimously asked that we agree to the Private Members' motion without tabling an amendment.  The office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, telephoned me and said he would talk to me at the party meeting.  However, owing to the prolongation of events in the other House, we did not have a meeting, and I must ring him on the conclusion of the Order of Business.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, line 22, after "work" to insert ", use".I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to the House.This amendment essentially broadens the category of person whose interests can be considered in developing a district.  Users of the area, for example, customers, should be also considered.  It extends the category's ambit to include more individuals.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	174	This amendment proposes the inclusion of the word "use" after the word  "work"  in section 129B(2)(a).  As it stands, the Bill provides that the project services and works in a BID proposal must be, in the rating authority’s opinion, for the benefit of the business improvement district and those who live, work or carry on an activity in it.  That is a broad-ranging provision in itself.However, it also must be read in conjunction with subsection (3), which sets out the wide range of matters that may be included in plans or initiatives under a BID scheme.  In particular, paragraph (a) makes specific reference to Schedule 13 to the Local Government Act 2001.  That Schedule contains a comprehensive list of matters under such headings as artistic, linguistic and cultural activities, sports, games and similar activities, general recreation and leisure activities, general environmental and heritage protection and improvement, and the public use of amenities.  When all those provisions are taken together, it becomes clear the existing Bill is sufficiently comprehensive to address the point raised in the proposed amendment.  It is also clear the outcome of BIDs will benefit all users of a business improvement district.In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	175	Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in the name of Senator McCarthy are related and may be discussed together.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 9, line 8, after "concerned," to insert "and on the internet".These amendments essentially provide for free public access to any proposal on the Internet.  I had tabled another amendment.  The correction, as suggested in my amendment, will be included at the reprint stage.  Therefore, it does not appear on this.  I therefore cannot claim credit for it, but I will.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I do not propose to accept these amendments as they stand.  The existing provisions in section 129D provide that a copy of the BID proposal must be made available at the principal offices of the rating authority concerned.  The existing provisions in section 129D(a) do not prevent a rating authority from posting a BID proposal on the Internet.  In addition, section 129E(d) does not prevent a rating authority specifying an Internet website address in the public notice, which invites input to the Bill proposal.I am, however, prepared to consider an amendment which provides that a BID proposal may be made available on its website by the rating authority.  If acceptable to the House, I will propose such an amendment on Report Stage.  There may be aspects of a BID proposal that may not readily transfer to electronic format.  In addition, there may be issues as regards obtaining licences, for example in the case of maps, which could delay the total BID process.  I hope this will be acceptable to the Senator.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The Minister of State's response sounds very reasonable.  On that basis we withdraw the amendment.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Will the Minister of State say whether the local authorities will be the facilitators of this particular legislation?  Will there be co-operation with the local authority?  It is important to have co-operation because local authorities are responsible as regards the development of town centres etc., and providing open spaces.  It is imperative to  have a strong  co-operative element between local authorities and businesses in the operation and implementation of this legislation.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I do not see what the question has to do with the amendment concerned.  However, in terms of co-operation, obviously the purpose of the legislation will be to ensure there is a level of co-operation between business and the local authorities that has never been seen in Ireland before.  This was discussed in great detail on Second Stage.  We have seen instances in other jurisdictions where BID legislation has been extremely successful in terms of enhancing business involvement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Amendment No. 4 is a Government amendment.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related, therefore, amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, will be discussed together by agreement.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Amendment No. 4 provides for the substitution of the words "may be inconsistent" for "is inconsistent" in section 129F(1).  The purpose of this subsection, in the first place, is to allow the rating authority an opportunity to examine the submissions received during the public consultation phase and second, to give an indication to the BID proponent of its analysis of those submissions.  On balance, it is considered that the words "may be inconsistent" are more appropriate at this stage in the process.The main purpose of amendment No. 5 is to ensure that a plebiscite cannot be triggered by the BID proponent until after the 60-day period allowed to the rating authority to examine the submissions received during the public consultation phase and notify the proponent of its view as to the possible inconsistency of the proposal with the interest of the local community in mind.  It is appropriate that the BID proponent should await any notification from the rating authority under subsection (1) before allowing the proponent to proceed to plebiscite stage.Amendment No. 6 involves a consequential amendment in section 129G(1).
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	183	That is reasonable and may be beneficial in the future.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	184	From a public interest viewpoint, I want to ensure that no further stealth taxes will be introduced under this legislation.  A total of 57 stealth taxes have been introduced by the Government since it took office.  Is there a mechanism in this legislation for introducing other forms of taxation?  That is of concern because most of the people who will be affected are paying very heavy rates at the moment.  Some local authorities strike higher rates than others.  It is important to have balance and perhaps there should be some Government assistance towards the implementation of this legislation by way of a grant, subsidy or whatever to local authorities.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	185	One of the cornerstones of this legislation is the public input as regards how these BIDs are formulated and put together and what they will do for an area.  That there will be wide public consultation, not just with residents but also with business people in an area and the other agencies including the Garda, is important.  The local authorities will have their local area committees in place already.  The Member opposite might be accustomed to turkeys voting for Christmas on his side of the House.Anybody who has an input into how these BIDs are put together will not be looking for increases.  It provides business people in an area with the opportunity to invest in their immediate vicinity.  It gives them the opportunity to have an input into what is being put into the immediate vicinity.  We have seen the excellent work that has been done in O'Connell Street, for instance.  Much of what was done there was in conjunction with the local businesses and it is a prime example of how business investment in areas such as this will enhance an area.  The cornerstone of this initiative is the consultation process that precedes it.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I should like to assure him that just as on all other occasions, the Government continues to give an extraordinary level of funding to local authorities.  There was never such a degree of cash endowment among the local authorities in terms of the funding from the Government levy and the moneys they generate.  I have no doubt this is not going to interfere in any way, but will provide additionality to what is happening on the ground .Before leaving this section, I should like the House to note that my officials are examining the possible need to define the term "unoccupied" and related terms in sections 4 and 5, new sections 20, 129N, 1290, 237B, 237C and 237E.  We need to look at definitions within other relevant legislation. to ensure that any necessary definitions are incorporated in this Bill.  If it is considered appropriate I will table an amendment on Report Stage.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	189	As regards "unoccupied", some local authorities are better than others at implementing the Derelict Sites Act.  It is a problem throughout the country, where disused premises have become an eyesore within communities, in town centres, etc.   Will there be further powers in this legislation to address the problem of derelict sites and related unoccupied buildings where graffiti is scribbled all over them etc.?  That is often a problem and can destroy the centres of many  towns participating in tidy towns competitions.  It is important there be some form of co-operation in place to ensure this does not happen.  We must ensure that the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act are fully implemented because some local authorities pay little attention to it.  This issue must be addressed on a nationwide basis and perhaps a directive could be issued to local authorities to encourage them to more fully implement the provisions of the Act to which I refer.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I reiterate that the Bill does not contain provisions relating to the Derelict Sites Act.  There is no reason to make provision in this regard because local authorities are provided with adequate powers under that Act.  I take Senator Bannon's point that we should perhaps bring to the attention of local authorities the fact that they should use the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act much more than they do at present.  The Bill before the House will help to enhance the business areas to which the Senator refers.  In conjunction with the partnership approach embodied in the Bill, this can only augur well for town centres and the business communities that become involved in bid proposals.

It is considered that it would be more appropriate for the council to make such appointments.  There are many precedents for this and examples include the appointment of members to joint local authority committees and appointments to bodies such as VECs, harbour authorities, regional authorities, local government associations and partnership boards.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Amendments Nos. 14, 29 and 42 are cognate and amendment No. 41 is consequential on amendment No. 42.  The amendments may, therefore, be discussed together by agreement.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	197	These amendments provide for the insertion of new subsections (5) and (6) in sections 129P, 237D and 237F.  The latter provide for a recalculation of the BID contribution levy, the property entry levy and the post-entry year property levy if the valuation of a property changes.  The amendments provide that in the event of an appeal under Part 7 of the Valuation Act 2001 against an amended rateable valuation and where the valuation is further amended, the rating authority must recalculate the amount of the levies.The amendments are considered necessary because the existing provisions of the Bill would not have covered a situation where an appeal is made subsequent to a revision of a valuation.  Where the outcome of an appeal results in a rateable valuation that is different to an amended valuation, it is appropriate that the levies should be recalculated accordingly.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Minister of State has more or less identified an additional source of revenue and the amendment he made will lead to an extra burden on ratepayers.  Was that his intention in including amendment No. 14 at this late stage?  Perhaps he will elaborate on the position.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The mechanism of an appeal is available to everybody and it is the responsibility of individuals to submit appeals, which will then be considered.  In the event that an appeal results in an amendment being made, the Bill now states that we must take cognisance of this in terms of the levy that will be imposed on businesses.  The Bill is consistent with existing legislation.

It came to light, following publication of the Bill, that a Part 22A had been already inserted by the Local Government Act 2003.  It is necessary, therefore, to reposition the new Part 22A.  It will now be inserted as the new Part 19A after Part 19.

We hope to bring it back here for Report Stage within the next three weeks.I welcome the positive reception from all sides of the House to the concept of business improvement districts.  As Senators know, this has been tried and tested elsewhere, especially in the US and Canada, and I believe the success achieved elsewhere can be translated to our cities and towns in the years ahead.  The positive effects of business improvement districts can be many and varied.  As well as improving business, they will also have a positive effect on communities living in a particular area.  Business improvement districts have a positive effect on tourism and help create employment.  In some jurisdictions, business improvement districts have contributed to a reduction in crime, an issue which is never far from the agenda in this House.  I appreciated this useful and constructive exchange of views and I thank Senators for their contributions.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  My party supported this Bill which will definitely improve the quality and environment of town centres.  It will initially provide for all manner of development within towns.  We all know how difficult it is at certain times of the year to get co-operation among business people for certain things.  For example, when Christmas lights are erected in towns, some business people will not co-operate with the project.  There is now a mechanism where everyone will have to play their part.  It will also enable towns throughout the country to become more attractive.  It is important for the business community and the public and will make towns more attractive for industries to locate there in the years ahead.  It will also rejuvenate town centres, which was the aim of the Bill.This concept was first introduced in Times Square in New York.  Those of us who have been to New York have seen how that part of the city has been rejuvenated.  It is important for business to approach the measures within this Bill positively.  While we are all in agreement with the Bill, I have reservations about stealth taxes.  Both the public and local politicians are always on our backs regarding the increased charges imposed by local authorities.

Such was the agreement from Senator Bannon that he did not table any amendments.  That reflects the uniformity of consensus in the House.

The Minister of State and I sat near each other when we were members of Cork County Council.  I raised an issue on the Order of Business regarding the service local authority officials now provide to Oireachtas Members.  Last month marked my fifth year working on improvement works in lieu of housing and by next March I will have been dealing with an enforcement issue in Rosscarberry for four years.  I have contacted the local authority by fax, email and phone.  There are issues in the broader context of the Minister of State's portfolio that need to be taken into consideration at some point.  This may not be an opportune time to raise this issue, but it is one of which the Minister of State is probably aware.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I, too, thank the Minister of State and his officials for the efficient disposal of Committee Stage.  I look forward to the speedy introduction of this Bill.  It will certainly go a long way to enhancing not just our major cities but also our towns.  There is a great opportunity for local authorities and local business to co-operate and make improvements in their areas.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to three additional protocols to the Europol Convention, Protocols 2000, 2002 and 2003, which have been negotiated since the Europol Convention, and two earlier protocols in 1996 and 1997 which were given force of law in this jurisdiction by the Europol Act 1997.  The protocols in question will be, on the passing of this Bill into law, Schedules to the Europol Act 1997 and will allow Ireland, subject to Government approval, to ratify them.The creation of the Single Market and the breakdown in borders within the European Union has facilitated an increase in cross-border crime.  In the context of the emergence of the Single Market and the removal of trade barriers, Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of member states were acutely aware of the need for measures to prevent the exploitation of free movement by criminals and to protect their citizens against organised crime.  It was this concern which led to the decision by the European Council at its meeting in Maastricht in 1991 to establish Europol.  The precise role and powers of Europol were formed over the following years and culminated in the Europol Convention in 1995, which provides the legal basis for Europol. The enactment of the Europol Act 1997 in Ireland paved the way for ratification of the Europol Convention along with the protocols of 1996 and 1997.The Europol Convention provides a framework for law enforcement co-operation in the field of international organised crime. It provides for the establishment of Europol in October 1998 following ratification of the convention by all member states, including Ireland.  The mission of Europol is to make a significant contribution to the European Union's law enforcement action in terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime with particular emphasis on the criminal organisations involved.  Its aim is to act as the European centre of excellence for intelligence exchange, crime analysis and the fight against international crime.  It also aims to improve the effectiveness and co-operation of the competent authorities in the EU member states in preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international organised crime.The enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify three additional protocols which are the subject matter of the Bill.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that these protocols should be given effect by way of amendment to the Europol Act 1997.  Enactment will allow Ireland to fulfil its international obligations.  Their effect will be to extend the mandate of Europol, clarify certain powers and streamline the work of Europol.  The passing of this Bill will not alter in any major substantive way the structure of Europol.The Bill is divided into five sections.  Section 1 amends section 1(1) of the Europol Act 1997 by adding definitions for the three protocols with which we are dealing.  Section 2 amends section 2 of the Europol Act 1997 to give force of law in this State to these three additional protocols and to provide for judicial notice to be taken of them.The first of the protocols, that of 30 November 2000, extends the competence of Europol to money laundering regardless of the type of offences from which the laundered proceeds originate.  As we know, that is a very important issue.  The second protocol requiring ratification by Ireland is that of 28 November 2003.  This protocol clarifies certain powers regarding joint investigation teams and the privileges and immunity applying to members of Europol.  It is important that maximum benefit is derived from co-operation between member states when investigating cross-border crime.Provision for officials of Europol to participate in a support capacity — I emphasise this — in joint investigation teams is provided for in Article 1 of the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams, and under Article 13 of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters between member states of the European Union.  The protocol in question clarifies liability and privilege in respect of Europol's participation in such teams.  The third protocol under consideration, dated 27 November 2003, streamlines the internal working of Europol, particularly in respect of liaison procedures and analysis and the processing of dataSection 3 amends section 6(1) of the Europol Act 1997 by providing that the Data Protection Acts apply for the purposes of the Europol Act 1997, the Europol Convention and the five protocols to the convention, namely, the protocols of 1996 and 1997, as well as the three protocols that are the subject of this Bill.  This section was introduced at the suggestion of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to clarify that the Data Protection Acts apply for the purposes of the protocols as well as for the convention.Section 4 provides for the addition of the three protocols in both the English and Irish languages, as schedules to the Europol Act 1997 and section 5 contains the Short Title.  Hence, the core of the Bill comprises the three Protocols which are to become Schedules to the Europol Act 1997 and which may then be ratified by Ireland.It is all too clear that as a small country we cannot tackle effectively all the problems associated with the activities of organised crime on our own.  We must share information and intelligence with other countries regarding the operations of criminals who operate internationally, their modus operandi, their networks and the routes they use.  Organised crime, particularly in respect of crimes such as drug trafficking, is not easy to combat.  Criminals engaged in such activities have considerable resources at their disposal to use skilled people and sinister methods to overcome the obstacles that society puts in their way.  It would be naïve to think that such ruthless criminals could be defeated by anything other than an energetic and proactive approach that embraced effective international co-operation and the highest level of professional police work, both in Ireland and in terms of co-operation with police services abroad.At the heart of the European fight against organised crime is better and closer co-operation between national law enforcement agencies and between national police services in particular.  The environment within which Europol operates today is quite different from that which obtained at its foundation in 1998.  Many decisions and framework decisions have been adopted by the Council in the justice and home affairs area since that time.  Many of the instruments adopted formed part of the reaction and response to new levels of terrorist threats.  As a result, police co-operation via European Union channels is now routine.A number of other bodies operating in the area of law enforcement and security, such as Eurojust, the European Police College, CEPOL, and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, FRONTEX, have been established.  In the context of the changing environment, the Austrian Presidency of the Council launched a political debate on the framework and objectives of the further development of Europol at the informal meeting of Ministers, which was held in Vienna in January 2006.  At that time, Ministers were invited to discuss how Europol could be developed further, in order that the law enforcement authorities of member states could derive maximum benefit from any such development.  At that meeting, Ministers gave a clear commitment to strengthen Europol and make it more effective.Ireland's fight against organised crime and terrorism in the international sphere is closely linked to the increasing effectiveness of Europol in fulfilling its mandate.  The effective functioning of the Europol information system has greatly increased the potential of the European Union in prioritising strategic crime analysis, policy advice and law enforcement.  The fundamental structure of Europol is strong.  It is ideally equipped to carry out its required role in respect of information exchange and analysis at a European level.  Due to its historical position as the first institution of Third Pillar co-operation, it has the longest experience of any organisation in European Union law enforcement.  The general consensus at present is that Europol should be allowed to continue to grow within its current framework.  However, it is important to note that the future role of Europol is based on the general principle that the main responsibility for combating serious international crime and terrorist offences in the European Union will remain within the competence of national law enforcement agencies in individual member states.  Europol should continue to operate as a multi-agency organisation in full co-operation with all competent national authorities.Ireland must play its role in the work of Europol and to this end, ratification of these three protocols is important.  I am confident that Members will recognise the importance of the measures contained in this Bill and I look forward to their constructive deliberations.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this Bill.  Fine Gael has always supported the timely and effective integration into Irish law of international treaties, protocols and agreements to which we are signatory in line with our international obligations.This Bill enshrines three protocols concerned with international policing co-operation and co-ordination.  As the House is aware, Europol is the European Law Enforcement Organisation and its vital function is to improve the effectiveness and co-operation of the police forces in the member states in dealing with criminal matters in a joined-up manner.  The organisation, which was established by the Maastricht Treaty almost a decade and a half ago, helps all European police forces to combat terrorism, tackle unlawful drug trafficking and confront serious forms of international organised crime.The organisation is based in the Hague in the Netherlands, not far from where the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992.  Since 1994, it has co-ordinated work between the Garda Síochána and its counterpart agencies and it became fully integrated in 1999.As of 1 January 2002, the mandate of Europol was extended to deal with all serious forms of international crime listed in the annex to the Europol Convention that was enshrined in Irish law by the Europol Act 1997.  The work done by the approximately 500 people who work for Europol in the Netherlands is an invaluable tool against growing international crime, particularly in an area such as the European Union, in which ease of movement has been greatly increased and which now faces the prospect of further expansion of its international borders to the East.When the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1953, few imagined that just 62 years later, Europe would have borders with countries such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, the latter two of which did not then exist independently.  If and when Turkey joins, the European Union will stretch from the coast of Connemara to the deserts of Iraq, the frozen Siberian landscape and the Black Sea.This important and progressive expansion brings new opportunities for European Union citizens and those of the accession countries alike.  However, it also brings great challenges for administration and control.  The European Union will soon stretch as far as some troubled regions in which instability is the order of the day.  Organisations such as Europol ensure we can present a united front to elements that threaten the security of our borders, countries and citizens.  Police co-operation means that dangerous criminals do not fall between inevitable administrative cracks and are caught in the wide net of police co-operation and information sharing.It is therefore incumbent on every member state to ratify the protocols and to enshrine them in national legislation as soon as possible. I regret that Ireland does not do so more expeditiously and this regret is not restricted to matters concerning Europol.  I have raised this matter in the House before, as the Government always seems to have something more important to do as it limps from one crisis to another.  As the pertinent protocols to the Bill are six, four and three years old respectively, the Minister should have found time to integrate such important agreements into the Statute Book before now.  Nonetheless, Fine Gael supports this Bill and its implementation and will not delay or obstruct its important passage.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	220	It gives me great pleasure to be the first to welcome the Tánaiste to the House.  I wish him continued success as Tánaiste.There is unanimity in this House on the purpose of and the need for this Bill, which I welcome.  The purpose of the Bill covers a number of areas.  First, it extends the competence of Europol to money laundering, regardless of the type of offence from which the laundered proceeds originate.  Second, it clarifies certain powers relating to participation in joint investigation teams by members of Europol and the privileges and immunity applying to members of Europol.  It also streamlines the internal workings of Europol, particularly as they relate to liaison procedures and the analysis and processing of data.That is where the future lies.  Criminals today work in an international environment, in which the ability to transfer funds from one bank account to another is instantaneous.  The Europol (Amendment) Bill 2006 addresses that.  We need to be able to follow the money trail because those who put money before life, limb and liberty have already made a conscious decision to make money their god.  It would give me great pleasure if we could take that from them.  As part of that goal we established the Criminal Assets Bureau to take assets and the proceeds of crime from convicted criminals, which I welcome.Together with the freedoms we enjoy there are people who hate our lifestyle and oppose the liberty we enjoy by means of terrorism.  Terrorists today may have access to different types of weapons than heretofore.  I do not welcome the proliferation of countries with nuclear capability.  It is a dangerous development and I hope it can be contained.  The more countries that have nuclear weapons the greater the opportunities for terrorists.  Having seen the way a weapon of mass destruction, in the shape of an airline carrying fuel, was used as a weapon to kill large numbers of people, I cannot exclude the possibility that it may happen again in the future, which we must address.  The only way we can do that is by intelligence gathering and by giving Europol the means to counter the current capabilities of terrorists and criminals.  Therefore I welcome the Bill and recommend it to the House.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I welcome the Minister.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, where a delegation from Poland served as a reminder of how European we are and why we need such legislation.  I also welcome the Bill, but I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms at the delay in bringing these measures before the House.The Bill gives effect in Irish law to three protocols to the Europol arrangements.  The first of these protocols dates back to the year 2000.  The most recent of the three dates from 2003.  Here we are, towards the end of 2006, in our customary leisurely manner, finally getting around to putting them onto our Statute Book.  What kind of a message does this send to the criminals of Europe, who are constantly adapting their techniques and strategies to evade the forces of law and order throughout the Continent by identifying the countries where they can most easily do so?What kind of a message does it send to our partners across the EU, who must be growing rather impatient at the adamant and repeated refusal of this country to become fully involved as an integrated part of a Europe-wide system of justice?  From time to time we hear offered as an excuse for delays in implementing EU directives that they need an immense amount of time and widespread consultation before Irish legislation can be put together to translate them into Irish law.  That excuse will hardly hold up in this case.This is not a complicated Bill with widespread ramifications across a raft of existing legislation.  On the contrary, it is to a great extent a technical Bill, one that will not have caused the Parliamentary Counsel to lose much sleep or expend much midnight oil.  Most of the pages of the Bill — 39 out of a total of 43 — are taken up with an exact, word for word transcription of the three protocols in question.  In these days of cutting and pasting, it would have taken no more than three or four minutes to carry out that part of the work.  However, for such a simple measure, it takes us upwards of six years to take the necessary action.  Why?  Can it be that the authorities consider that these protocols are of such little importance that they deserve no sense of urgency at all?  Can it be that the authorities attach a very low priority to the business of co-operating with and interacting with their counterparts across the EU?If either of these explanations is true, that is a fundamental misjudgment.  It fails to take into account a growing reality that we ignore at our peril.  I first became aware of the concept of Europe as long ago as 1959 — few Members in the House today would have been around at that time.  I finished university and boarded a boat in Cobh for Le Havre.  Spending the winter in Europe I understood, for the first time, what Europe meant.  Young people my own age were excited about a united Europe and had a vision of the future even before the EEC came into being and 12 or 13 years before Ireland joined.  I am not sure that the excitement of that time still exists, in Ireland at any rate.  We need to show our commitment to Europe but when we take such a long time to pass legislation we send a different message.The open borders of Europe, which we all appreciate and enjoy so much on a personal level, have greatly increased the facility with which criminals can operate across international borders.  The vast steps forward in communication over the past decade, whether in cheap and frequent air flights between international destinations or in the now myriad ways of sending messages instantly and in total secrecy over the Internet, have a downside as well as obvious benefits.  That downside is something that is very well known to those who lead a life of crime, but it is something that our forces of law and order have been much slower to recognise.  To do its job properly now, our law and order system must keep fully abreast of these new developments.Co-operating effectively across international boundaries should be a top priority of our national system.  All the evidence, including the tardiness with which the measure before us now has been treated, is that this matter is far from being a top priority, if indeed it is a priority at all.  I have the strong impression, from previous excursions into this area, that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is far more concerned with jealously preserving the differences between our legal system and those across most of the rest of Europe than it is in finding ways of bridging those differences in the interests of defeating crime.In this context we see the dragging of heels in the implementation of even the simplest and most straightforward of technical measures that will bring about better co-operation.  There is a lingering mindset within that Department which we have seen at work in regard to immigration matters.  It is what I term a "Little Ireland" mentality, a mentality that until recently used to rejoice in using the term "alien" for anyone it felt minded to exclude from our shores.  It is a mindset that thinks it can do its job perfectly well without letting the outside world impinge on it to anything more than the most minimal extent.  If there ever was a time for that kind of mentality, it has long since past.We need to develop an attitude to our neighbours that reflects the kind of Ireland in which we now live, the prosperity of which depends crucially on foreign trade, with open and free interaction across national borders.  We have everything to gain by opening an enthusiastic co-operation with the forces of law and order the length and breadth of Europe and much to lose by approaching it half-heartedly, dragging our heels in the way that the timing of this Bill so glaringly illustrates.  I spent my few minutes not commenting on the technical aspects of the Bill but rather urging us to commit to taking a different attitude to ensuring we become part of Europe because it would serve us well to do so.

The Irish Parliament should perhaps simplify this process although the law officers advise that primary legislation is responsible for every change in the protocols to the Europol Convention.  Perhaps we could deal with future changes by a resolution, instead of presenting the memorandum for Government, going to the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office, then to the Houses and committees, in order to make relatively insignificant changes.  As Senator Quinn said, there is no implication for our sovereignty in co-operation of this kind.  It mystifies me that these matters gather dust for so long unratified.  We and one other member state are holding up the ratification process.We are not the only people in Europe who are open to criticism.  When I took on the presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in 1994 I tried to resolve a wrangle about who should be appointed head of Europol.  That agency had no head for more than 18 months while France, Germany and Italy were deadlocked on which of three candidates should be appointed.  The other member states were clear that they would decide this by whatever means were possible but it required unanimity.  These three founding member states of what was then the European Economic Council, and subsequently the European Union wrangled long over which of their candidates would be appointed.  My efforts to arrive at a consensus by agreeing that we would take a vote to determine the majority opinion was frustrated for more than a year because people thought it better to hold out and gain more leverage on the issue through other events in other places.This does not have earth-shattering consequences but co-operation is important.  We must ask ourselves whether, if there is to be another amendment to the Europol convention by way of protocol, it is necessary to have primary legislation.  Could we instead provide for some system of delegated authority to each House by simple resolution to approve future amendments to the convention within certain limits?  We do not want Europol to become a police force in Ireland without the approval of these Houses.  Subject to that caveat this is a somewhat cumbersome procedure for making relatively small changes to the Europol Convention.I take the criticisms offered and do them the justice of offering no defence, spurious or otherwise.  That something has not been addressed since 2000 is not the right way to do business.  I thank the Members for their Second Stage contributions and ask the House to agree that the Bill be read a second time.

The White Paper on Irish Aid was launched by the Taoiseach and I on 18 September last.  We were joined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The White Paper has been widely welcomed and praised by everyone in Ireland who is interested in development, as well as by our partners in the developing world.  The launch in the Mansion House, at which there was standing room only, was attended by more than 500 representatives of missionary orders, non-governmental organisations and the rest of the development community.The White Paper, which is an important document, has been published at a critical time in the development of Irish aid.  Ireland's capacity to make a real difference in the developing world has never been greater.  The Government has pledged to reach the United Nations target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012, which would be well ahead of the EU target date of 2015.  Ireland will ultimately spend approximately €1.5 billion, which is an enormous sum of money, on overseas development each year.When I took responsibility for overseas development assistance two years ago, I promised to make the 0.7% commitment the subject of a proper timeframe.  I made it clear that it would be proper and appropriate to publish a White Paper on this issue for the first time.  I said the White Paper would set out in concrete terms Ireland's objectives in the area of development assistance.  I am proud the White Paper has been completed, exactly two years later.  It will act as a road map for the expansion of the Irish aid programme well into the future.When one considers that Ireland's total development aid budget was €142 million in 1996, it is clear there will be a massive increase in our spending on aid.  A commitment of the magnitude I have outlined demands a matching determination to ensure the additional moneys are spent well.  It requires that we plan carefully for the future and show the Irish people how and where their money will be spent.  The White Paper is a blueprint for the growth of Ireland's official aid programme.  It sets out clear priorities for Ireland's expenditure in this area.  It was drafted in dialogue with interests in the developing world, our multilateral partners and various non-governmental organisations.  It was shaped by consultation with people throughout the country.  The public supported 11 meetings at various locations by expressing viewpoints and forming attitudes on those occasions.  The opinions which were expressed at those public meetings have become part and parcel of the language of the White Paper.  The ideas which were outlined have been captured within the document.The White Paper on Irish Aid, which was agreed across all Departments, is unique as a full expression of this country's development aid policies.  The Departments of Health and Children, Agriculture and Food and Finance, for example, have expressed their agreement with the ideas outlined in the document.  It was critical to acquire the agreement of the Department of Finance because it will play an integral part in the development of the Irish aid programme by sanctioning the money needed for that expansion.  I would like to record my deep gratitude for the work of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who not only provided significant financial resources but also contributed many ideas during the writing and shaping of the document under discussion.The White Paper details the Government's response to the clear wish of the Irish people that this country should show leadership in the area of international development.  Ireland has always had such a position in the fields of development assistance and aid.  Irish missionaries trod a well-worn path to Africa and other parts of the world for hundreds of years before the State started to speak about putting in place an Irish aid programme.  They created a culture of acceptance of Irish people in poor countries.  Their work meant Irish people were not considered to be going abroad with the colonial baggage of those from countries with superpower status.  Ireland is seen as a world player — an influential moral voice — in the development area for those reasons.  The White Paper on Irish Aid tries to capture and build on the goodwill that has been generated by missionary workers, including priests, over many generations.The Oireachtas has a key role to play in providing leadership in the development sphere.  Irish Aid has always enjoyed a close working relationship with the Oireachtas.  The White Paper commits the Oireachtas to developing that relationship.  It is important to ensure Members of the Oireachtas are informed of and engage with the work of the Irish aid programme.  The Government values and wants to build on the broad cross-party support enjoyed by development co-operation.  I assure all Senators that the Government would like more and more of them to visit the Irish Aid programme countries so they can become acquainted with the Irish Aid programme.  I ask them to spread the message of good news to the people in their local areas with whom they deal as busy public representatives.The debates held in the Oireachtas facilitate detailed public discussion of what Irish Aid does, and how and why it does it.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for generously giving the House time to discuss the issue of overseas development on many occasions since I became Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Seanad has taken a real lead in this respect.  I would like the other House, of which I happen to be a Member, to follow the lead of the Seanad in this regard by opening up to more regular formatted debates about the overseas development field.In the White Paper, the Oireachtas is invited to rename the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Irish Aid.  We are inviting the Oireachtas to make such a change, as we cannot instruct it to do so in the White Paper, which is a pure expression of Government policy.  This modification has been suggested because we think it would be appropriate and timely for the committee to consider changing its name and giving equal standing to the overseas development aid and foreign policy priorities.  The White Paper ensures, in effect, that development assistance and Irish aid will be at the heart of Irish foreign policy.  It is the first time that has been stated so clearly in a public policy pronouncement or document.  The key point in the White Paper is that development assistance should be at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy.  If the name change is effected by the committee, it will reflect that the work of Irish Aid has a much greater role in Ireland's overall foreign policy.  That is also what influenced me to rename our efforts "Irish Aid" as distinct from "Development Co-operation Ireland".  I wanted to make the strong integrationist link between our foreign policy and development assistance.  In many ways, development assistance is a clear and practical expression of the values we hold given our historical experience of colonisation and famine.  Irish Aid stands as a proud manifestation of the idealism we have as a people.Several Members have travelled to see Irish Aid's work in developing countries.  Having spoken to those Members, I am convinced it is the best way to understand what Irish Aid is trying to achieve and the context in which it works.  It also helps to strengthen the parliamentary systems in our partner countries by showing them the key role that Parliament plays in our democratic system.  I encourage other interested Members to do likewise and the Department of Foreign Affairs will help with travel arrangements.  Members are often criticised for visits abroad with the usual media carping, ignoring that it is parliamentarians opening themselves up to global experiences.  These visits are not junkets, as depicted in some newspapers, but informative experiences.  I was shocked and moved on my first visit to Africa.  It had a life-changing element to it.The White Paper sets out guiding principles for the growth of the programme.  Reducing poverty and assisting the poorest people in the poorest countries is the overarching objective of Irish Aid.  This poverty focus was praised by the OECD and other international observers.  Ireland has a strong world reputation for the effectiveness of its development assistance.Africa will remain the principal geographic focus for the programme because it is the poorest part of the developing world.  The promotion of human rights, directly and indirectly, will continue to be central to Ireland's foreign policy and the work of Irish Aid.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will work to ensure coherence and a joined-up approach to development across all areas of Government.  The White Paper recommended the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to encourage this.Irish Aid will continue to remain completely untied to the use of Irish goods and services.  Ireland is unique in this regard, making us one of the most virtuous donors.  The White Paper is essentially characterised by new initiatives and the best practice that already has grown up around the programme in the past 30 years.  These principles will not be altered even with changes in Government or Ministers.As the programme grows financially, our engagements will be broadened and deepened.  The number of key partner countries will be increased in the medium term, from eight to ten.  Care must be shown in how the programme is rolled out in new countries.  That is why I opted for a smaller increase in partner countries.  Malawi will be the first so designated as it fits the criteria for new partner countries.  The White Paper contains more specific details as to why Malawi was chosen.  We will deepen our focus on working in fragile states.  Building on our existing activities, including our role in UN peacekeeping operations, our efforts on Sierra Leone and Liberia, both countries with hugely challenging operating environments, will be focused.While Africa remains our main focus, we must also respond to need in other parts.  To this end, the regional programme in south-east Asia will be built on, working from our most recently designated key partner country, Vietnam.  The opening of the aid programme and embassy in Vietnam is a way of branching out to Cambodia and Laos, which are in dire straits.  We will also be increasing our responses to humanitarian emergencies wherever they occur.  With the renewed financial commitment and moneys from the Department of Finance, more is now spent on emergency aid.  When I become Minister of State two years ago, Ireland spent on average €20 million a year on humanitarian emergencies.  This year, the budget stands at €60 million.  It will increase even more as we approach the 0.7% target in 2012.The White Paper calls for the establishment of a rapid response initiative to enable Ireland to respond more effectively to the sudden onset of emergencies.  This initiative includes the pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas and the drawing up of a roster of skilled individuals from the public and private sectors, including the Defence Forces, for deployment at short notice to emergency situations.Ireland will forge a distinctive role in the areas of conflict prevention and resolution and peace building, drawing on our own experience in and knowledge of these areas.  From our experience of conflict over the past 30 years, the Anglo-Irish section of the Department of Foreign Affairs has acquired particular skills.  These can be brought to bear in other conflict situations.  However, we will not replicate what other countries have done.  For example, Norway has done fantastic work in the Middle East.  We do not believe we will be duplicating Norwegian efforts but instead bringing unique Irish skills to conflict resolution.  A dedicated unit for conflict analysis and resolution will be established in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It will not simply be a Civil Service-led operation but will grow organically, involving ongoing co-ordinated contact with non-governmental organisations, the Oireachtas and others.  It will not simply be a unit in the Department but will have strong local and global impact.A hunger task force will be established to examine the particular contribution Ireland can make to tackling the root causes of food insecurity, especially in Africa.  In addition, the existing corps of Irish development volunteers serving across the developing world will be expanded and assisted.  To that end, an Irish Aid information and volunteering centre will be opened which will make more and better information available to the public about volunteering opportunities for individuals, institutions and communities.  For the first time, Irish Aid will have an accessible shop-front presence providing comprehensive information on all aspects of development and volunteering.Development co-operation is a contract between donor and recipient, with obligations on both sides which they must honour in good faith.  Recipient countries must ensure our aid gets to where it is most needed and that no moneys are diverted from this cause.  They must use resources for the public good and work to combat corruption across all areas of society.  We must insist on a steadfast adherence to democratic principles and human rights.  To this end, we are establishing a new governance unit within Irish Aid which will be a focal point for all our activities in this area.  We already allocate significant resources towards governance within Irish Aid and the development programme generally.  The purpose of the new governance unit is to co-ordinate our activities effectively in this area and to ensure we are transparently accountable in this regard to the public and to this House.There is a quid pro quo in terms of development.  Enormous sums of money have been committed by Ireland and many other EU countries on a bilateral basis.  Like Ireland, they have made a commitment to achieve the target of 0.7% by 2015 in the EU collective sense.  The amounts of money being committed are staggering.  By 2010, the commitment by the EU 15 will bring €20 billion extra into play in the developing world.  This requires that our partner countries are clear about what we expect of them in terms of governance and adherence to basic democratic principles and to the fight against corruption.  With those amounts of money being dedicated, we must be accountable to our citizens and taxpayers by providing adequate assurance that the money we are spending is being used effectively and for the purposes to which it is dedicated.  As we expand this programme, it is important that we can guarantee the public that its money is being spent well and appropriately.Ireland will continue to take a lead in the fight against the scourge of HIV-AIDS.  Our spending on HIV-AIDS and other diseases exceeds €100 million a year, more than 10% of the total Irish Aid budget.  I  was especially proud last year to attend the millennium summit in the UN General Assembly at which the Taoiseach made a strong pledge on our target of reaching 0.7% by 2012.  In a decision made in conjunction with myself and Irish Aid, he also announced that we would double the amount we are spending on HIV-AIDS.  This has increased from €50 million per year in 2005 to €100 million this year.  This decision, announced by the Taoiseach when we attended the UN summit on AIDS last June, was widely and strongly supported by the international community.  This was a great occasion, even though there was something of a domestic crisis blowing up at home at the same time, which meant that much of what happened in New York was lost to the public.

He received the strongest applause of any world leader in recognition of Ireland's major commitment to the fight against AIDS.Last week, with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met with former United States President, Bill Clinton, to renew our co-operation in addressing this global crisis.  In the past three years, in partnership with the Clinton Foundation and the Government of Mozambique, we have reached the stage where more than 250,000 people receive HIV counselling and testing in Mozambique, with 83 facilities offering services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission and more than 20,000 people accessing anti-retroviral treatment.  This has been achieved in a short timeframe.People sometimes ask why we work with the Clinton Foundation.  We do so because it is recognised at a global level as one of the few organisations that can drive down the cost of anti-retroviral treatments.  In the past six or seven years, the price has gone from $10,000 per person per year to $150.  Much of this has been achieved through the good work of Mr. Clinton and his foundation.  They have put pressure on international drug companies and worked to persuade them it is in their own interests to lower prices.  What the pharmaceutical producers of these anti-retroviral products get in return is a greatly expanded treatment scene and increased volume of sales.We decided not merely to have a mid-term review but to devise a completely new five-year agreement with the Clinton Foundation at a cost of €70 million.  It is one of the few organisations that can upscale its activity by bringing more people into treatment in a short timescale.  We are proud of this association.  Irish Aid funds are being used by the foundation to make real and significant progress.  Many people asked Mr. Clinton why he should get this €70 million and he was clear in pointing out that the foundation does not retain the money.  Rather, it flows directly to the host governments.Any Member with a medical qualification will be interested in our co-operation with Lesotho.  Our work there is unique and different because it will be the first time a country will be allowed to have universal testing for HIV-AIDS.  This has not happened to date in Africa.  There will also be a real-time evaluation by United States academic health institutions.  They will evaluate, as it is becoming operational, this particular roll-out of anti-retroviral treatment in Lesotho.  This will add greatly to our ability to transplant the lessons learned in Lesotho to the other African countries in which we operate.The new agreement between Irish Aid and the Clinton Foundation, which grew out of a series of meetings between myself, Mr. Clinton and our officials in Mozambique, Lesotho and New York, will run for five years.  The agreement will see us expand our successful co-operation to Lesotho.  Our plans for Lesotho are very ambitious.  It is a country that is experiencing one of the highest HIV infection rates in the world.  Again, our co-operation will focus on the development of treatment programmes but, critically, we will also recruit and train HIV-AIDS health workers to ensure there is an adequate infrastructure in place to administer newly available drugs.  It is my sincere hope that our work in Lesotho, in the provision of universal access to testing and treatment, will become a model for other countries.The White Paper recognises that public awareness and support are critical to the success of the Irish Aid programme.  While communicating the challenges that face the developing world, we must also present the success of our projects, such as the impact we are making in fighting HIV-AIDS in Mozambique.  As Minister of State with responsibility for Irish Aid, I will continue to work hard to ensure an increasing number of people are made aware of the important work we do on their behalf.  There is a simple message that we can convey.  Every day, through Irish Aid, our taxpayers are helping the world's poorest people.  Every day, Irish Aid saves lives.The challenges may appear daunting at times, but we have many examples of progress whereby Irish Aid is having a definite, positive and sustaining impact.  In Lesotho in 1999, for instance, enrolment in primary schools was at 57%.  With Ireland's support, by 2003, this figure had increased to 82%.  In Ethiopia, through our safety nets programme, Irish Aid is keeping hunger at bay for more than 6 million Ethiopians every year.  With Ireland's support, immunisation rates against childhood diseases in Uganda are now at 84% for the entire country.Irish Aid is helping to realise the human potential that is in people who want only a fair chance for a fair life.  In doing so, it is saying something important about who we are and the values that are important to us.  The launch of the White Paper is not the end of a process but the beginning of something more ambitious than ever before.  There is much to be done to implement all the recommendations within the document and I sincerely hope that this House will play its part.  As the Taoiseach said at the launch of the White Paper: "The fate of others is more than a matter of concern to us; it reflects on and affects all of us."I thank Members for their unique and helpful interventions and advice since I became Minister of State.  I stress the genuinely non-political character of this aspect of our foreign policy.  Many elements of foreign policy, ranging from Northern Ireland to the UN and other interventions and stances, are highly charged and political and occasionally lead to cross and disputatious words in both Houses.This, however, is a non-political area and one to which all parties have contributed.  I think most particularly of my predecessors, Deputies O'Donnell, Kitt, Burton and Jim O'Keeffe.  A great many Ministers of State in different political colours have contributed enormously to the development of this programme.  It is highly regarded at international level and the purpose of the White Paper is precisely to provide a much larger platform through which aid can become an integral part of our foreign policy and of how we express ourselves in the world.  I thank the members for their patience.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his comments and presentation.  It is not the first time the Minister of State has addressed this House on the issues of Ireland's aid budget and international responsibilities.  He brings great determination, flair and energy to his portfolio and I congratulate him on his efforts to date.The Minister of State has correctly asserted that Irish overseas aid is not a party political issue.  We must ensure that Ireland's responsibilities to the third world and the impoverished remain at the top of our political agenda.  We have not seen politics at its best in the past week and we will not replay those old points.  It is important to recognise that this White Paper and debate represent politics at its best.  They show how the political leaders of this country can ensure that resources are put to their best use as we fulfil our international obligations.Overseas aid is not simply a political issue, it is a moral issue.  Ireland and the EU have a responsibility to see that we do more than merely what may be termed "our bit", but become world leaders in international aid.Aside from the party politics of the debate, the public has a huge interest in this topic.  Ten or 15 years ago the public did not tune into environmental issues, it took some time.  It is only now that the public views the state of the world's environment as it should.  Overseas aid and the debate around trade and aid are now subjects of great political interest to much of the electorate.  This is a good thing because it challenges us and demands we respond in the fashion expected by the Irish people.The Taoiseach committed, some time ago, to reach the UN aid target of 0.7% of Gross Domestic Product.  Unfortunately this was not met, but a new target is in place and it is imperative that we meet our new deadline date.  We cannot allow the poorest of the poor to be disappointed on a second occasion.  I acknowledge that the Irish record on overseas aid spending is very good by world standards, however it has not reached the level we would have sought to be at by this stage.  Let us ensure that the new target date is not avoided.If we are serious in seeking to meet the new target then this commitment should be put in legislation.  This point has been made previously by my colleagues in the Fine Gael party and I am sure the Minister of State has heard it often.  Examples of this exist already in a number of areas of Government policy.  The legislation underpinning the National Pension Reserve Fund saw a political decision taken to have a pension reserve set up for the future.  The percentage of our overall budget to be contributed to the National Pension Reserve Fund was enshrined in law.  This does not require an annual Dáil review because the amount is set in legislation.  Something similar could be done regarding our overseas aid target of €1.5 billion of GDP.  This would remove party politics from the equation and would be a firm indication of a political promise becoming a reality.Bringing forward an overseas aid development Bill and specifying the 0.7% of GDP to be allocated would, finally, copperfasten our commitment to our international obligations.  The Irish people would welcome this because they have a great sense of responsibility for the less well-off around the world.  This is evident in the response to every international disaster, most recently the tsunami crisis.  We are excellent at responding to a crisis with aid, now we need a structured overseas aid plan.  Nothing could be more secure in underpinning our commitment than legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to give this some consideration.The White Paper must be welcomed because it will be a benchmark indicating where we are going on this issue.  Hopefully it may serve the same function for some of our European neighbours and countries such as the United States where, if one considers the core figures, the same level of international commitment does not exist.  The sooner we enact these commitments the easier it will be to put moral and political pressure on our European colleagues and other countries around the world to match, and perhaps surpass, our commitments.The White Paper refers to newly designated countries and the fact that Malawi will be the first such country.  I welcome this because I have a particular personal interest in Malawi.  In 1993 I visited Malawi as an Oireachtas representative acting as a supervisor of the referendum.  For the first time in 20 or 25 years the people of Malawi were allowed to vote to determine their political direction.  The dictator, Dr. Kamuzu Banda, had held office for some time and allowed the referendum on whether the one-party dictatorship should continue after much political pressure.  The people of Malawi voted in favour of a multi-party, democratic system of government and there was great hope that a new future would be carved for the country.  A new administration was put in place and the reign of Dr. Banda came to an end.Unfortunately, for many reasons the country did not flourish politically, socially or economically as we had expected.  The Malawi of 2006 is not much better off than the Malawi of 1993.  I hope that with more Irish aid and a stronger international focus on the country we will be able to offer greater assistance to Malawi.There are dozens of countries and hundreds of regions we could mention and focus on.  Unfortunately this is not possible because of the size of Ireland and its budget.  No matter what we do and no matter how high a percentage of our GDP is devoted to overseas aid we will not solve all of the world's problems.  In that regard, it is appropriate and sensible that the White Paper, even when it moves beyond aspiration and leads to action, does not proclaim we will solve all the issues facing the Third World today.  By targeting our resources and ensuring what we do is done well and effectively, we can begin to make a difference.The Minister of State mentioned political responsibility and I note his suggestion on the new interdepartmental committee on development aid, to be chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This committee will result in a new focus on an issue to which the public is finally tuning in.  An Oireachtas committee on development aid could be a powerful tool.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, as currently constituted, does a lot of work but, as with all the other Oireachtas committees, it is under-resourced and under-staffed, as the Minister of State will know from having served on committees.  If the new committee is to work well, it will certainly need more resources.  At best, most of the Oireachtas committees are in a position to meet only once every fortnight or three weeks because of problems such as a lack of accommodation and recording facilities.  We need to sort out these issues.  I look forward to the new committee playing a major role.I support the initiative the Minister of State is to launch towards the end of the year, the scheme to build strong links between the schools.  If the school-going population of this country assumes an ever-more-active role regarding development aid and becomes politicised in respect of it, it will exert on us political and moral pressure to ensure we honour our commitments.  Bringing the schools on board will be very effective.The concept of financial accountability may not weigh well against that of looking after the poorest of the poor, but it is very important that the euros contributed be spent well.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made some recommendations and expressed some concerns in this regard and we must reflect seriously on them because we are responsible not only for ensuring the budget is maximised but also that the allocation is used to the maximum benefit and spent where needed.  We can reflect on what the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying on some other occasion.  He has, in his usual non-partisan and non-political fashion, raised serious concerns that must be taken on board.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	At the United Nations General Assembly in September 2005, the Taoiseach said, "It is an affront to our common humanity, five years after the Millennium Summit, that 30,000 children die each day from easily preventable diseases, or that 100 million people go to bed hungry, or that 100 million children are not receiving a basic education."  These words are included in the Foreword to the White Paper.  They outline a major world problem and the White Paper serves as an attempt to tackle it.Ireland is now a wealthy nation and is reckoned to be eighth among 177 countries in this regard.  With wealth come duties, responsibilities and obligations.  When Ireland was a poor country, it relied on emigration and the kindness of others and therefore it is now payback time.  Every hour, 1,200 children die mostly from preventable diseases and they receive no media attention, only the attention of their grieving parents.We have set our official aid target at 0.7% of our GNP and we expect to achieve it by 2012, which is well ahead of the EU target date of 2015.  This will result in a sum of approximately €1.5 billion by 2012.In 1996, overseas development assistance amounted to €142 million.  One will note the great increase in the aid we make available, but is not enough just to give aid as we are also responsible for ensuring it is used wisely and does not end up in the hands of some dictator.  This happened some years ago when Mengistu used the aid he got from the Europeans to slaughter his own people in Ethiopia.  I spoke about this many times in the House and it could happen again, and it is therefore important that we monitor the spending of our aid.There is a need to prevent AIDS and we are taking the lead in this regard.  Our spending on HIV-AIDS and other conditions exceeds €100 million per year.  In the three years of our partnership with the Clinton Foundation and the Government of Mozambique — I heard the Minister of State mention this — more than 500,000 people have been receiving HIV counselling and testing and 83 facilities are offering a service for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.While there is a moral imperative for wealthy countries like Ireland to provide assistance, their partner countries have a responsibility to use that assistance well.  The aim should be to allocate aid to where it is needed and we must insist on steadfast adherence to democratic principles and human rights.I express my appreciation for all our missionaries, including priests, brothers and nuns, who, over the years, went to work in the poorest countries of the world.  Not only did they spread the faith but they also helped to establish hospitals, schools and small local industries.  As the number of Irish religious missionaries declines, we rely increasingly on lay missionaries and NGOs to do their work, and that is why the White Paper is so important.  It outlines the positive values of Irish people, their abhorrence of injustice and poverty, and their determination to assist the developing world.We are no strangers in this country to the problems of terror and famine, and of our occupation for so long on the part of our nearest imperialist neighbour, and we are therefore glad to help others out of the imperialism of multinational exploitation, which faces many of the poorer countries.  Huge multinationals rape the resources and wealth of the countries in question leaving very little for the native populations.  It is in such countries we must monitor our aid to ensure it is spent on what we decide is necessary.The Minister of State mentioned Malawi.  It is a very poor country and is to be Ireland's ninth programme country.  Some 12 or 15 years ago a delegation from the Brothers of St. John of God, comprising a doctor, brother and two nurses, went to Malawi and, without help from the Government of that country or anyone else, established a little hut which has now become a thriving hospital staffed by some Irish people and trained Malawians.  This proves that with sufficient will and help, progress can be made.The Minister of State mentioned we are to focus more on places such as Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The trouble about speaking after the Minister of State is that he has, in his wide-ranging speech, said everything that needs to be said.  I will, however, repeat some points because action thereon is so necessary.  The White Paper seeks considerable public involvement and refers to the rapid response initiative, which will include a roster of highly skilled individuals from Ireland, to be deployed at short notice to emergencies and disasters as they occur.  Thanks be to God no triple-lock mechanism applies to this sort of force.  A dedicated unit for conflict analysis and resolution is to be established in the Department of Foreign Affairs to share Ireland's experience and knowledge of conflict resolution and peace building.  That is also very important, as is the Hunger Task Force, which draws on public and private sector expertise to tackle the root causes of food insecurity, especially in Africa.We will open an information and volunteering centre to facilitate those wishing to volunteer to work in the developing world.  A schools-linking scheme will be established so that our schoolchildren can see for themselves the challenges their counterparts face in harsher environments.  When poorer nations are mentioned, we frequently think of Africa, but there are great areas of poverty in South America and in parts of the Philippines, Indonesia and so on.  It is a worldwide problem, and some continents are worse than others.The Minister of State mentioned an interdepartmental committee on development that will be established at Cabinet level and through which the Oireachtas will be invited to arrange regular debates on development in the Dáil and Seanad.  The most important part of the White Paper is the establishment of a governance unit to monitor where we are sending aid, how we are doing it and so on.  As the Acting Chairman will know, we receive a great many documents on our desks from all kinds of people throughout the country and the world.  There is a great tendency to throw many of them in the bin because since there are so many, we are overwhelmed with information.However, I ask Members to read this report.  As the Minister of State said, it is expected, hoped and designed to be non-partisan.  It is a Government response that will continue irrespective of who is in power.  It is not a party political matter but something to help the poorest of the poor.  I ask each Member to read this.  If Members have copies they do not require, they should send them to a school, for example, where people might do projects on them and so on.  The report is among the finest to be produced recently and merits our attention.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House.  Like everyone else, I am delighted with the White Paper that he has produced.  Perhaps I might begin by congratulating him on the energy and enthusiasm he has brought to the job.  It is quite right that the Minister for Finance should have given him more funds to continue his work.I am glad he has recognised that this is not a party political issue and praised those who came before him.  It is very nice to see that happen in the House, and I congratulate him on that.  I also congratulate him on the fact that this was an in-house document rather than one produced by consultants employed by the Department.  It was quite right to recognise the calibre of those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and their knowledge of foreign aid.  I have met many people from the Department working abroad and been very impressed by their expertise and tact.It is quite right that citizens should know how taxpayers daily help the world's poorest people through Irish Aid.  It saves lives every day.  It is right to use the word "taxpayers" rather than calling it "Government money", because it is the taxpayers who contribute.  It is nice that we should acknowledge that they are doing all this.  We can proudly recognise all those who have been involved in aid work abroad.  The Army has rendered noble service in various places, and we have a very good foothold, as Senator Lydon mentioned, in the shape of the missionary work carried out in Africa in particular.  Their achievements in health and education there were truly phenomenal, giving us a good start.The European Union is the greatest giver of aid to the developing world.  Taking into account EU and individual government contributions, we give €90 per citizen, compared with €50 and €55 from Japan and the United States, respectively.  Although some countries have an imperialist past, Ireland did not have one, and neither did some others in Europe.  However, they too feel their obligation to support development, and the Minister of State is quite right to stress how important that is.It is also important to recognise that aid from Ireland is untied.  I had the privilege of speaking on Capitol Hill to an audience including many Members of the House of Representatives and a few from the Senate.  They did not realise how much of their aid is tied.  It is important to give developing countries a chance to make their own decisions.  Of course, we should monitor them, but they will never grow up and develop the ability to make decisions themselves unless they are given a chance.  We cannot constantly decide what will be done with whatever moneys we send them.It is only right that the UN millennium development goals be addressed here, given their importance.  The first is the elimination of poverty and hunger.  We have been extraordinarily good at buying locally if a country has a famine problem in one part, since frequently there is not a famine problem across the state.  The prosperity of those in the region where there is grain or whatever for sale is helped enormously by our buying locally.  Sometimes we must pay more for transport.  Malnutrition is still the great killer of infants and small children in the developing world.Universal education is the second UN millennium development goal, and we want both boys and girls to complete primary education.  It is important to remember that primary education in developing countries does not always start at five and finish at 12.  One can find children five years or more apart in the same class who have had to drop out of school occasionally for some reason.Gender issues are addressed in the document, but with regard to education, the sexual rights of children and adolescents have not been emphasised sufficiently.  If girls must make early marriages because of local tradition, and particularly if there is an early pregnancy, that is the end of their education.  We know how difficult it can be to keep teenagers in education in this country if they become pregnant, but in developing countries it is impossible.We cannot order behavioural changes but we can say to countries that we would like them to promote the enforcement of the legal age of marriage.  In many countries it is 16, but one frequently sees girls of 11, 12 or 13 married off as a second or third wife to some much older man.  That can be the end of any possibility of education; if she falls pregnant, that is definitely the case.  In such early teenage pregnancies, the risk of the mother or her infant dying is twice as high as with an adult woman.  I would like to see, therefore, mention of that inserted in the text.We cannot impose policies on people, but we can certainly encourage them.  We can also discourage the sugar daddy situation which was brought to my attention regarding both Uganda and Zambia.  Girls become involved in sex with older men who pay for their school fees, uniforms and so on.  That situation is deplorable, and we must recognise it and try to end it.In the White Paper, the Minister of State has stated that budget supports are essential.  As I said, we must encourage countries to monitor themselves as well as endeavour to do that remotely.  The Minister of State is right to say that it is important that Members go abroad to examine projects.  We did not come down in the last shower of rain, and we can assess progress.  It is important that we encourage countries to involve civil society and promote their own non-governmental organisations.The third UN millennium goal is the reduction of child mortality by two thirds.  We mentioned malnutrition and the serious effect it can have on a child.  However, malnutrition of the mother is equally serious.  The World Health Organisation recommends that a child be breast fed until the age of two.  While breast feeding reduces a woman's fertility, it does not prevent her becoming pregnant, and she may wish to space her children so that the infant can be breast fed until the age of two as recommended.It is important she has access to family planning facilities.  Abstention, if she wishes, is a possible option for not becoming pregnant but there should be available supplies of family planning methods if she wants to space her family.We know 500,000 women die in childbirth every year in the world.  A woman in Africa has a one in 16 chance of dying for reasons associated with pregnancy or childbirth, compared to a woman in the developed world who has a one in 4,000 chance of dying of similar causes.  We must continue to support those maternal health areas in which we have been involved because they have been worthwhile.  When one sees how these clinics operate in rural parts of Africa one recognises their importance.A third of illness among women in the developing world is due to problems with sexual and reproductive health.  Women frequently do not have much choice about sex in that part of the world and it is important this is recognised.  I wish the Minister of State had said more about the prevention of AIDS/HIV in his paper.  Every minute some 650 people become infected with HIV through sex.  Prevention has to be promoted in the developing world.  People have to be given information on why women become pregnant and men who know they are HIV positive should be warned of the even more serious consequences for women who are raped by men with the virus.  Lesotho has a terrible record of AIDS/HIV transmission.  Uganda, however, has made enormous progress in this area by promoting prevention.  It is not just talking about abstention but also about promoting the use of condoms.  We must ensure condoms are available as needed.  I have heard the argument that female condoms should be made available to women in areas of conflict because rape may be a crime of war.  That is not of much use to a woman who is HIV positive.We are also tackling other communicable diseases, for example, malaria.  It is interesting that the World Health Organisation has recommended the use of DDT in houses, which it has not recommended for some time.  We are trying to prevent leprosy and the vaccination of children is incredibly important.The fact the Minister of State has discussed environmental sustainability is also welcome.  Perhaps we could become more involved in microeconomics in yet another area, as we have frequently with great imagination in developing countries.  For example, the Minister of State will be aware that in these countries women frequently carry loads of sticks on their backs, having being out most of the morning breaking down small trees and gathering them to bring home to light fires.  This is bad for the environment because breaking down all the small trees leads to deforestation and soil erosion.  It is also a terrible waste of the woman's time when she could be doing something more productive.  Such women spend a lot of time in a smoky atmosphere.  I suggest we encourage the private sector to promote the use of solar ovens in those areas.Finally, let us not be too hard on the recipient countries.  Accountability is essential, but we must realise they cannot write reports all the time.  Reports are much easier for us to write — perhaps we write too many.  Accountability is important so that the stakeholders know where the money is being spent.  In developing countries people frequently have to make difficult choices as to whether to invest in roads or school books.  I am sure such decisions are much more difficult for them than for us and we should try to be as considerate as possible when these issues arise.I again congratulate the Minister of State on the splendid work he is doing.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the high profile he has given Irish Aid in recent times.  What is significant about today's debate is the fact that there is a White Paper.  As the chief executive of Concern said, and I agree, it has set an example for other European states.The White Paper has the support and endorsement of all Ministers.  This shows it is firm Government policy and not just an isolated initiative within An Agreed Programme for Government.  That is important because an issue such as world hunger cannot be put into a box and isolated from other activities, possibilities and opportunities.  We certainly have come a long way from the days when there was a little "black baby" box on the teacher's desk at school, into which the children put their coins and the little black baby figure on the box nodded its head appreciatively.  Even then, as a young person, it gave one a spiritual lift because one felt one was interacting in some way with humanity, even though one did not fully understand how.  Nonetheless, one sensed there was some small appreciation for what one was doing.  I am sure back in those days the same difficulties existed throughout the world.Tens of millions of people are hungry today.  This problem was not highlighted to the same extent in the past when we did not have television or other media outlets to horrify us.  Anyone with a heart not made of stone who watches some of the television pictures that depict this poverty must wish to God he or she had the answers.  One tries to understand why this is happening and the White Paper has helped in this regard.  Why is there a scarcity of food in the world?  That has to be examined.It is vital for us to realise that it is not always the climate that causes the problems.  In many of these countries the problems are often caused by a thirst for power among dictators and the conflicts which arise therefrom.  Perhaps this is the time to sound a note of warning that all world powers should be careful about their foreign policies to ensure they do not create further conflicts which are often perceived to be for the selfish needs of the powers involved.  We must ensure this is not the case.  I hope some of the cynicism which surfaces is not firmly rooted or grounded.  Part of that cynicism is expressed when people comment on how amazing it is that world powers can go into areas where they have vested interests, while ignoring other problem areas.  For example, one of the greatest problems of all time is the AIDS epidemic.  Medicines exist which could help those affected.  The difficulty is that the patents on those medicines are held by people who could release them if they wanted to.  The medicines could be produced at an exceptionally low cost but those who control the patents allow tens of thousands of people, including children, to die simply because they do not regard intervention for such purposes in the same light as military intervention.I am not very familiar with the foreign policies of various countries, except from what I read.  However, the foreign policy that always seems to have no vested interest and is rooted in humanity is that of Ireland.  That has been the case right back through the years.  The present Irish Aid programme, I understand, extends back over 32 years, to a time when the country was not as affluent as it is today.  There has always been an urge to do something and this comes from our past experience. It is in our genes to want to help because Ireland suffered famine of genocidal proportions in the past.The Minister of State was correct to highlight that Ireland can offer something exclusive, namely, its experience in the area of conflict analysis and resolution.  That experience can be transposed to and used in other arenas.  Ireland does not seem to have enemies in the sense that it never colonised or tried to exploit other countries.  This is evidenced by the welcome for the White Paper.  It has been welcomed by the aid agencies, the missionary groups, etc.  I have never seen such unanimity.  I would go so far as to say the media was exceptionally generous in its coverage of the launch of the White Paper.  I compliment, in particular, The Irish Times on the extensive coverage it gave in this regard.In my view, this underlines the existence of the elements for partnership to which the White Paper refers.  It is a matter of doing what the Minister of State indicated earlier and it is evident that Members agree this is not a party political issue.  There is no need for people to be politically partizan in respect of this matter.  This issue does not merely concern our role in globalisation, it relates to our role in a much more fundamental matter, namely, humanity.  All of this is inherent in the White Paper.Another strength of the White Paper is the extensive consultation that took place in respect of it.  Who are those operating at the coalface in this area?  It is the NGOs, the volunteers and the missionary groups.  It is evident there was widespread and intensive contact with these groups, which was important.  In the past and in connection with documents of this nature, people often wondered on which shelf they would be put.  The White Paper will not be put on a shelf because it is now in the ownership of so many different groups and people that progress in respect of it will be monitored.We do not know what the future holds but no one is saying we cannot exceed the target of €1.5 billion for 2012.  The Irish people will support the Government in respect of whatever level of aid, no matter how generous, it decides to provide because within 24 or 48 hours of recent emergency situations arising they responded to help alleviate the suffering of others.  While there must be a rapid response to emergency situations, our final aim must be to make poverty history throughout the world.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	232	This issue is of such considerable importance to so many people that the Labour Party will forgive the Minister of State for trying to steal its thunder by publishing the White Paper during its two-day conference in Cork.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	234	We will, however, have greater difficulty forgiving the junior partners in Government for holding their conference on one of the days to which I refer and thereby distracting attention from our deliberations.  We will not fall out on this issue.I wish to begin by apologising to the Minister of State.  On his initial appointment and for the fun of it, I made a few less than flattering comments as much to annoy his aunt as anything else.  However, the energy he has brought to his job is a credit to him.  I will continue to disagree with him about many matters but the energy and enthusiasm is refreshing, welcome and has illustrated a general sense of activism.There are many comments I wish to make in respect of the White Paper.  However, I wish my comments to take the form of constructive suggestions regarding things we could do better.  May we take it as read that there is nothing in the White Paper with which anybody in Ireland disagrees.  I will avoid referring to delays, broken promises, etc., and will merely state that such promises were made and were broken.I hope we have reached a consensus that the target of 0.7% for overseas development aid should be reached by 2012.  We are a generous people but there are countries situated not too far away that are moving beyond that target.  I will happily qualify that and state that, in respect of other areas, some of these countries are not in a position to point the finger at Ireland because much of their aid is vigorously tied.  It is easier to set a target of 1% if a country is determined to inform the recipients of aid that the additional 0.3% will be comprised of what that country wants them to purchase from it.  That is a pretend form of aid.Ireland's fundamental decision that its aid would not be either explicitly or implicitly tied was one of a considerable number of such decisions that displayed foresight and generosity.  The decision to which I refer has given rise to Ireland's overseas development aid being of a very high quality.  This might have been a factor in the delay in not reaching 0.7%.  I am not persuaded in that regard but I accept that it might have been a factor.  It would have been bad to lose the sense of the importance of quality.  The White Paper refers a great deal to the need for quality.I am somewhat disappointed because the impact of the arms trade on development is not dealt with in the White Paper.  The two are inseparable.  I attended a conference in Nairobi before last year's summer recess, the subject of which was the availability of small arms in the Great Lakes region.  What I heard and saw there was terrifying.  When I refer to small arms, I am not merely talking about pistols.  The weapons referred to went from pistols up to and including light missile launchers that could be slung over one's shoulder.  Literally hundreds of thousands of such weapons are available in the Great Lakes region of Africa.The scandalous aspect of this matter is that approximately 60% of the arms to which I refer originated in some part of Europe.  That is disturbing.  The European Union must take action in respect of this matter.  Many governments have a reasonably good record on the issue of armaments.  However, The Irish Times yesterday — lost among other matters — contained a report from Oxfam, Amnesty, etc., that the world is spending more on arms now than was spent at the height of the Cold War.  It was stated in the report that $1.058 billion is spent each year on armaments, 80% of which are produced by six countries, five of which are the United States, Russia, Germany, France and Britain.  This represents the most phenomenal waste of money.We cannot change the entire world but we have a duty to examine our values in this area.  There has been considerable discussion regarding reviewing the licensing system for dual use materials.  However, the debate has never been progressed.  I invite the Minister of State to release some of his energy in the direction of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and ask it to get the finger out and take action.  I will not criticise a Government that takes decisions, even if it means that jobs will be lost in some areas.Trading in arms is an immoral way to prosper.  The report from Amnesty, Oxfam, etc., refers to the ways in which it is possible to avoid the restrictions that are in place.  This links to development because one of the mistakes many developing countries make is that they seem to believe that regardless of their level of impoverishment, they must have armies of First World quality.  Whether per capita, as a percentage of GNP or whatever, we spend less on defence than many countries that are not in a position to provide a decent living for their people.  In that context, it must be remembered that we were obliged to live with terrorism and all sorts of civil insecurity.I am not necessarily stating that the arms trade should have been dealt with in the White Paper.  However, the latter remains incomplete in the absence of our facing up to what I believe to be one of the most immoral trades.  It is even more threatening to ordinary people than the drugs trade.  It is of enormous significance; 30 times more money is spent on arms than on overseas development aid.The apparent unwillingness to confront our impact on developing countries is also linked to this.  The metal coltan is used in the manufacture of mobile phones and the smuggling of it is at the core of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The DRC has large and valuable coltan resources and the trade involves neighbouring countries and others.  If we do not have a rigid, enforceable control of arms, weapons will be sucked into areas where people consider it worth fighting to get their hands on extremely valuable resources.  Coltan is one such resource about which we do not hear much.I also wish to address the issue of human rights.  I am not saying the Opposition is vastly better than the Government on this issue, I do not think it is that sort of a debate.  However, I am concerned about wobbly views on human rights.  Courtesy of the Minster of State, I was in Ethiopia earlier in the year.  It was a valuable and useful trip.  It is a sign of Ireland's standing in Ethiopia that the delegation spent almost two hours having a full and frank discussion with the prime minister on internal Ethiopian affairs.  We could have been told that they were internal affairs and therefore none of our business.  Neither the prime minister nor the Irish delegation took offence at the nature of the meeting's content and I am sure it served some purpose.  I am sure the Minister of State's diligent officials have given him a comprehensive report on the meeting and he probably knows more about it than I now remember.I contrast the funny happenings in Ethiopia and our willingness to understand its problems — I fully accept the need for the Government to take a measured approach — with the boycott of the democratically elected government of the Palestinian Territories.  It is difficult for me to explain to people in Palestine why we understand the pressures the government of Ethiopia is under, and yet we demand from the elected government of the Palestinian Territories a succession of rigid, inflexible preconditions that we demand from nobody else.  It undermines the moral basis of our whole commitment to development.While I am not sure of the latest phase, as they sometimes can get lost, there was a willingness to write off debt in the case of Iraq that has not been visible in many other countries, such as Mozambique, that are struggling to build functioning democracies.  There is a rigidity, slowness and conditionality about writing off debt that was not the case for Iraq.  We need to have a position that does not devalue itself by saying we believe in one thing but then support actions which mean something else.My Labour Party colleague, Proinsias De Rossa MEP, issued a report regarding child labour labelling on the produce of developing countries and it has been adopted by the European Parliament.  When I buy an item of clothing, it is dreadful that I cannot know where it was made.  It could well have been made in Burma or other countries where child labour is unregulated and unrestricted.  It is easy to say that this is outside the reach of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  However, this is an agreed White Paper and it should be agreed that the Irish public, which is so committed to the issue of development, should be in a position to exercise consumer choice via a proper labelling system where they know what they are buying is produced under acceptable conditions.While the White Paper deals at length with fair trade and free trade this mostly relates to food products, etc.  We must ensure the concept of fair trade extends into textiles and clothing to exclude the possibility of us saving a little expenditure on the back of exploited child labour.  In principle, my party welcomes the White Paper and look forward to its consistent and enthusiastic implementation.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I join with other speakers in complimenting and congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, for the initiative he has taken and the work he has put into preparing this document, the culmination of which was the recent launch of the White Paper by the Taoiseach and other Ministers.  It is clear that the Minister of State has spent considerable time and effort in drafting this document.  Not only have objectives been set down, they have been underpinned with financial commitments which are clearly set out in the paper.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, I appreciate the huge amount of work the Minister of State and his officials have put into this.  It will make a major contribution to dealing with the issues at national and international levels.It is fair to say that for many years the overseas aid budget was an appendix to the Department of Foreign Affairs Estimate and therefore never got the attention it deserved during the preparation of Estimates.  It was the poor relation of the Department of Foreign Affairs budget.  Thankfully this has changed.  I am glad that the Department of Foreign Affairs will manage this budget under the terms set out in the White Paper.  There were suggestions that this might be hived off or broken up and that would have been a major mistake.It is also significant that the Minister of State went to great lengths to involve non-governmental organisations in the preparation of this paper.  More than 100 organisations made contributions to it.  The Minister of State visited various cities and towns so that the public would have an input and the paper is better for that — it will be more authentic and will better stand the test of time.  It is also important to acknowledge the contribution made by non-governmental agencies working with governmental agencies, the United Nations and other organisations in putting together initiatives to deal with this huge international crisis.  The frightening figures outlined by the Taoiseach when launching the document, particularly the number of people, especially children, dying of malnutrition and AIDS, is an indication of the urgency and necessity to proceed along the lines set out in the White Paper and reach the targets contained therein.  We appreciate the work of the NGOs, missionaries and others in contributing to this.I also acknowledge the work of the Defence Forces in this area.  I had particular opportunity to visit Irish personnel when they were in Lebanon and a major part of their peacekeeping effort was humanitarian.  During my visits, the local community acknowledged the humanitarian work the Defence Forces were carrying out.  While we have not had much time to study this paper in detail as it has only recently been launched, I am glad to see that Ireland will in future play an important role at United Nations level in helping streamline the various organisations that deal with aid issues.  Given the financial commitment we are making, we will now have a stronger voice.  This will also apply in the European Union, where we will be able to play a more vibrant role in proposing initiatives and ideas.  It is welcome that in this document the Minister not only deals with the issues from the viewpoint of the Irish people but also sets out the contribution Ireland can make in the United Nations, the Council of Ministers and the Commission to charting the future course of international policies in this area.  The previous speaker referred to the necessity to examine arms issues and other areas.The trade negotiations are paramount.  I had the opportunity, as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, to visit Tanzania and see the work being done in Kilosa.  In his opening remarks the Minister of State referred to the necessity for people to be more aware of this issue by visiting the locations to see the work being done on the ground by the various State organisations and agencies, and international agencies, and the co-ordination of all those involved.  The impact a small contribution can make on the lives and livelihoods of people in places like Kilosa in Tanzania is dramatic.  It was an eye opener for me to see at first hand the devastation inflicted on those communities through lack of opportunity, poverty, disease and malnutrition, but to see also the relief that even a box of Aspro can provide to people in some of those isolated areas which get very little attention from the international community.On the area of the trade negotiations, a point made to me by the Tanzanian authorities was that much of the overseas direct aid being provided could be significantly reduced if there was an initiative forthcoming in matters of trade.  When I was in Tanzania the people were concerned about opportunities for marketing bananas and had they been in a position to market some of their own commodities, it would have taken away much of the unnecessary attention that was being given by international communities.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I move:That Seanad Éireann will establish a petitions committee and initiate procedures for civil engagement with the Seanad through a right of individuals, community groups and organisations to petition the Seanad and make a request to the Seanad to take a view or initiate or amend legislation in relation to matters of public interest or concern.The motion sets out clearly what I would like the Seanad to do.  I thank my own group and the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, for the opportunity to elaborate on my proposal.I will give some background on the concept of the right to petition.  It is a right of persons or groups of persons either to request their legislature to do something or to make a complaint.  That right is available to the German people whose law states that every person shall have the right, individually or jointly with others, to address written requests or complaints to competent authorities and to the legislature.  The German Bundestag has set up a petitions committee, requests to which are primarily taken to mean suggestions regarding legislation, including enactment, amendment or repeal of a law, and complaints are primarily directed against the acts or omissions of administrative authorities.The right to petition is a very old right.  I have done some research on articles about the history of the right to petition and have identified that it goes back to the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 by King John.  That document set out rights of subjects vis-à-vis their king, but it included a petition of right, which is similar to petitioning a king regarding grievances.  The idea behind the right to petition was to allow people make complaints and petitions regarding grievances.  That type of concept is still in place; we only have to look to the example of the European Parliament.  It also developed into a much more substantial right, which is the type of right I would have in mind for the Seanad, whereby individuals or groups of individuals could call on the legislature to do something.  That is the way the idea developed in individual American states and it is still to the fore in some of them.In that type of right to petition, members of the public would have an instigating role.  They could come up with ideas for legislation and make requests.  Individuals or groups could identify a gap in a particular law and seek appropriate change.  They could also call for a debate on a particular issue.  Under this process members of the public could have a major influence on legislation and on their legislators.  Subject to checks and balances, they could instruct their representatives.  It would involve a dialogue between the public and Parliament.  It is a very old and radical idea.  Some parliaments have had such a process in the past, others have rolled back on the idea while others have taken it up and developed it very well.This issue was raised in the Seanad in 1925 in a debate about the presentation of petitions.  A question of procedure arose and the Earl of Mayo—

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	That was on 31 March 1925.  A debate ensued because the Seanad had not decided on the right to petition at that stage.  The Dáil had ruled out the proposal and the Seanad had not taken a view on it.  The petition was defeated but it referred the question of whether to take petitions in future to a sub-committee.  I could not find out what happened after that.  It appears the idea was not developed, although I cannot be sure about that.  It does not appear to have been raised in the Seanad since then.The type of right I have in mind is to allow members of the public have an initiating role whereby they can call for legislation.  It would be based on a bottom-up approach and could come from an individual group or even a county council.  This would be a way for Members to engage in dialogue with county councils.  Obviously, were this approach to be adopted, they could participate in it.A good example that could be considered is the manner in which the Scottish Parliament has introduced such a system.  On its establishment some years ago, it decided to allow the right to petition.  Mr. George Reid, who is presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament's Public Petitions Committee, has stated that:Many of the discussions that took place and shaped the Parliament that we have now were difficult.  When it came to discussing a petitioning system, however, we were united.  We were determined that we should be open and inclusive and that we should give the public access to their Parliament in a very Scots way.Members should do the same in an Irish way.  He also stated that the public petitions committee, which has been extremely successful, grew out of such discussions.In a sense, what they did was similar to what was done in Northern Ireland in terms of police reform.  They examined all models and came up with a good one themselves.  They have had many firsts, such as being the first Parliament to implement an e-petitioning system.  Subsequently, the German Bundestag examined it and has also adopted it.  They have held rolling meetings throughout Scotland in which they tried to promote the petition system and have included marginalised groups because they wish to try to engage the different sectors of society.I will provide some examples of how the Scottish system works.  Basically, it operates along the lines of this motion.  Individuals, community groups and organisations can make a request to the Scottish Parliament on a matter of wide public interest or concern, or to amend existing legislation.  Such petitions are forwarded to the Public Petitions Committee, which processes them — its 1,000th petition was presented today.  The committee goes through the petitions and can make a decision on them.  It can decide to do nothing, by closing a matter and not considering it.  Moreover, a petition must be appropriate.  There are many guidelines in this regard and a particular form must be filled out.  The committee can send the petition to a Minister for his or her consideration, it can have a debate in the Scottish Parliament or it can refer it to a parliamentary committee.  Ultimately, in Scotland this can and has led to changes in legislation.The petitions received by the committee are interesting. For example, its current list includes one from a primary school.  The school substantiated its petition application with research conducted by its students.  Essentially, the petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Executive to take greater action to protect the public, domestic and non-domestic birds as well as animals, from the dangers of broken glass; to promote the use of plastic bottles as an alternative to glass; and to introduce a refundable deposit scheme aimed at reducing the levels of broken glass in public places.  The petition includes details such as children's experience of broken glass in playgrounds.In the case of a primary school, the petition was drawn up on the students' behalf.  However, some petitions pertain to legislation.  One petition is from a man asking — Members will be interested in this and many will be opposed to it — to extend the prohibition of smoking to designated areas in the vicinity of non-smoking premises, such as doorways and pavement cafés.

This model differs from the European Parliament model, which is concerned with airing one's grievances.  It also differs from the e-consultation that was carried out in respect of the Broadcasting Bill, although that was welcome.  The right to petition goes much further.  There is real dialogue and the public has a significant instigative role, which is extremely important.This proposal would be ideal for the Seanad because its mandate is different from that of the Dáil.  Members are not elected to particular constituencies and can take a broader view.  Petitions would not be approached in a narrow fashion, while a Deputy might be placed under pressure on a particular issue.  Members can take a broad view and this House has a record for so doing in the past.  It has a record of being a less adversarial model.  Members go through the nitty-gritty of legislation and this could be also done with petitions once they reached the House.Moreover, there has been much debate regarding Seanad reform.  Senator O'Rourke has taken the debate on this issue much further than anyone else.  I have researched the issue and it has arisen many times.  Although many Leaders have facilitated debates and statements on Seanad reform, Senator O'Rourke is the only person who held proper public consultation on the issue, which resulted in a substantial report.

If Senator O'Rourke adopted this measure, she could change the Seanad in terms of public and civil engagement.  It could mark the Seanad as being separate from and more progressive than the Dáil.  People could feel a sense of ownership of the Seanad that may not be the case at present.  People feel such a sense of ownership of the Dáil because they elect representatives to it.  However, the Dáil is in major need of reform, perhaps even more so than the Seanad.

It would be remiss of me not to state that this is not helped by equivocation and evasion regarding loans, presents, dig-outs and other matters.  They do not help to achieve a sense a political engagement.  I will not omit this factor from the redress of political engagement.  However, I will not spend all of my time on it either.  I will leave it to the poodles of Ranelagh to do what they need to do in this respect.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	261	— politics has changed to a degree in western societies and ideological differences have become blurred, at least in the short term.  While I believe they will arise again because of forces at work in the evolution of economies that will reinvigorate a serious ideological debate, in the short term, members of the public are easily persuaded that who is in power makes no difference.  It would not have been possible to persuade working class Britain in 1945 that who was in power made no difference.  It would not have been possible to persuade them of this three years later, when a National Health Service was provided for the first time ever.  This made an enormous difference to the quality of life for working families and people.  There are specific issues like this.I will allude to the people of my father's generation, who campaigned for Fianna Fáil in the early 1930s and who saw massive programmes of public housing being built.  That programme was described by prominent academics as an example of Bolshevism at work.  It would not have been possible to persuade such people that policies made no difference, because in my home town they saw a move from mud cabins to houses with running water and a toilet.  At present however, it is much more difficult to persuade people that politics matters.  This is one reason for the decline in voting, although registers also have much to do with it.  However, the lack of a belief that one's vote matters is significant.  Part of what must be done is the re-engagement of the public with the belief that politics matters.  One of the more sinister developments is the way major sections of the media, in this country and others, send out a message that is essentially cynical about politics.  They concentrate on the entertainment value of the occasional idiotic remarks made by politicians, which are always picked up.  There are now almost as many colour features about politics as articles containing serious analysis.The same newspapers which create that climate are owned by people who are acutely aware of the importance of politics and who spend both time and money ensuring the politics that develop are the politics they want.  In the UK, more so than Ireland, they summon leaders of Government to their conferences to be reassured of that, even as their newspapers give the impression there is not much difference between politicians.  In this country one major newspaper group peddles the line that it does not make much difference who is in power because they are all the same and all equally corrupt, but the owner does not believe a word of it and cultivates politicians who agree with him.There is a great need to re-engage the public.  If an issue, local, national or international, agitates people or is not, in their opinion, being addressed with the priority it deserves, they need to be persuaded there is a process through which, without having to visit a clinic and outside election time, they can put it right.  Irish politicians, perhaps more than many others, have a good idea of what the public thinks, but things can get overlooked and our society has become much more complicated.  In the Minister's area, the environment, many of the best ideas have originated from local communities thinking about how to deal with problems.  It is not always the case but it is common.  Local communities are a great source of ingenuity, creativity and imagination.  It is very frustrating to spend years knocking on the doors of unresponsive bureaucracies to get things done that are obviously in the interests of the community.When I was first elected, community groups often asked me for advice about campaigning.  I used to reply that the first thing they needed was stamina.  They then asked what was the second thing they needed.  I said it was also stamina, as were the following ten things.  However, it should not be stamina.  Good ideas need to be tested but deserve to be heard.The way the media regard the commentary of people outside the political process, whether it be CORI talking about poverty or a non-governmental organisation discussing the environment, creates a problem.  Their response is to get politicians to have a row about it.  Then they decide to bring in dispassionate experts to talk about it.  I use a pet phrase, which I may have stolen from a piece the Minister wrote during his academic years, the tyranny of experts.The late Lieutenant General MJ Costello who, as I recall, was not a great admirer of Fianna Fáil, although I am not sure, detested experts who came into his office and tried to swamp him with gobbledygook.  He had a great belief in his own ability and believed himself to be reasonably intelligent.  If anybody came to him and told him something he did not understand, he would say that if they were real experts, they would be able to explain it to him.  He told them to leave, acquire a proper understanding of the subject and explain it to him.  That is the sort of expertise ordinary working families have, one based on experience.  They know what is wrong with their local communities.I am aware of a classic example which is now common practice.  For years local authorities, when building housing estates, whether private or public, used to lay paths only to discover that the public would not walk on them but went a different way instead.  Nowadays, in many places they wait a little while and see which routes people take.  Then they put the path where people actually want to walk.  It is very simple and sensible but previously only they knew where the path should be.  The fact that the people did not want to walk along it was a mistake on the part of the people.  Until recently, to put double yellow lines on a street in Cork required the permission of the Garda Commissioner in Dublin, as if the Garda Commissioner in Dublin would know anything about the nature of parking in Cork.  There was a belief that there was always an expert who knew the answer.The process proposed in this motion would not change things inherently but would foster a sense of engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas, this one in particular, that would begin a process of enhancing the public sense that politics is a process that delivers change.  We know it happens but the public does not believe it anymore.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I will do something dangerous and ignore my script.  I can give the Senator another story to quote.  When I was a civil servant many years ago, one of my senior and wiser people advised me about the dangers of Ministers who got their script too early and wrote on it.  The real horror was a Minister who got a script and then changed it.  Worse still was a character who actually said what he thought.A petitions committee is an interesting idea, something I do not say in a patronising way.  I will refer to two points made by Senator Ryan.  One is that politics matters.  If we do not believe that, we should not be here, nor should we subscribe to the idea that this is a modern democratic State.  Whatever we disagree on, we must agree on that essential common point.  I will make a couple of critical points but do not want be regarded as throwing cold water on what I regard as a fundamentally good idea.Senator Ryan also urged re-engagement with the public, with which I also agree.  If we care for democracy there is a critical need to do so.  If, as a State, we do not re-engage with the public or get the public to re-engage with politics, the country will end up being run by faceless people who, for all their many talents, will never be answerable to anybody.  We have created not just a tyranny of expertise but, in many areas of public administration and life, a tyranny of people who are not answerable.  That is wrong because the essence of democracy is for the people — the Demos — to have the right to express an opinion.There are many things I could say but I will focus on a couple of points.  I pay tribute to Senator O'Rourke and I am pleased Senator Tuffy did so.  She has driven the reform agenda in the Seanad, I will not say manfully—
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	263	There were many on the committee.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The Leader should not demur at a compliment.  It is right to engage in this discussion.  We have established a sub-committee under my chairmanship, as Senators know, which picks up on the work of the Leader's sub-committee.  The sub-committee touched on the area of public consultation, which is interesting.  I am pleased to say that Senator Tuffy's motion offers clarification in that regard in her focus on how the concept of a petitions committee could be developed, without cutting across other agencies, to create a sense of engagement.  Significantly, the sub-committee did not mention a petitions committee, perhaps because its focus was different.Following the sub-committee's report and on foot of a request from the Taoiseach and in consultation with all the party leaders, I established an informal all-party parliamentary group on Seanad reform.  It would be untruthful, however, to suggest that it has made any rapid progress.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The group's remit was to establish the extent of cross-party agreement on recommendations in the report.  Frankly, I am not sure exactly how much agreement there is.  There are some areas of consensus but others where I do not think it will emerge.  The group held its first meeting in October 2005 and will hold its fourth on 18 October 2006.I will make a proposal to the House and a couple of points about the idea of a petitions committee.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will consider the points I raise for the Seanad to clarify.  It can then bring forward the matter as the first item on the agenda for the meeting of 18 October where we can develop a real consensus around the idea.The motion focuses initially on the recommendations which could be effected, such as changes in Standing Orders, including the recommendation for the promotion of the Seanad as an appropriate place for public consultation in the early stages of legislation.  That is hardly an earth-shifting proposal.  To take forward that and other proposals and to update itself on developments in the interim, the group made contact with the relevant Oireachtas committees, the Taoiseach, relevant Ministers, Departments, and the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges and stated that the matter could be best pursued in the course of dealings with the Party Whips.The motion does not call on the Government, on me, or on the all-party group to take a specific action which is good because it sets a ball rolling and allows people to make up their own minds.  The motion seems to be an internal matter in the first instance for the Seanad and that is why it should ask the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges for its view.It needs, however, to clarify several issues.  I do not intend these points as criticism.  It is easy to destroy an idea and I do not wish to do that.  I am interested in the Seanad and in reforming it.  Senator O'Rourke tells me that we are not going far enough in the Seanad.  There is an area of real interest in this motion but the Seanad needs to say how it proposes to define the remit of the committee, for example, what sort of issues could be brought before it.  Senators Tuffy and Ryan indicated how it should approach that.  This needs clarity and focus.Senators Tuffy and Ryan suggest that issues would be confined to operations in the public services.  If a petitions committee is to focus on what is needed that would not be what is being done but what should be done.  We need more clarity here.How would such a committee fit in with other agencies such as the Ombudsman, the Freedom of Information Commission, or the Garda Ombudsman Commission?  If it is to handle petitions in the sense of complaint, an issue which Senator Tuffy mentioned, it ought not create an additional layer where there are already grievance agencies.  How would it relate to the Comptroller and Auditor General who sometimes deals with the use of public funds, or with the Oireachtas committees?What procedures would the Seanad employ to vet and prioritise complaints? It would not be a good idea for the petitions committee to become a listing agency with a long list of items, worthy though they may be, from the four corners of Ireland.  I can think of plenty of people standing at corners signing petitions.  The Seanad needs to think about that.What resources would be necessary?  If the committee is to make any sense we must discuss its resource implications.  The cost of the committee has not been established.  Will it need a budget line?  The most important question is whether such a committee would have an investigative role?  There have been many occasions when, as a public representative, I was extremely frustrated, for example, on the issue of the sale of lands at Glending.  There is a large volume of correspondence about this because I raised the issue as a Senator and as a Deputy.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	268	As a citizen, taxpayer and public representative I felt intense frustration that a valuable property, 14 miles from the centre of Dublin, containing millions of tonnes of sand and gravel, was sold for a ridiculous consideration.  When we started to ventilate the issue I found that my frustration was nothing compared with that of citizens who felt that a large and powerful multinational company, based here, had trampled on their rights.  Not only were they frustrated that their rights as citizens and taxpayers had not been vindicated but they had no way to ventilate their concerns.  There was no obvious complaint mechanism available.  Would the committee have some form of investigative capacity or role?  If so, then the Seanad needs to consider its relationship with the agencies I mentioned earlier.I do not intend these observations to be destructive.  We are searching for a role for the Seanad and I believe in the concept of it being used in this way because it is less gladiatorial and political than the Dáil.  Would the individual Senators carry out the investigations and if so how?Legal powers would also have to be considered.  Would it require power to compel the production of documents?  This is an interesting area because many Oireachtas committees have been extremely frustrated on this point, not only in dealing with parties outside the Administration but even in compelling the production of documents within the public sector.  Senator O'Rourke will recall a case when a new regulator chose to be less than forthcoming with information.  I was on the committee at that time, not being a Minister, and thought there was something quintessentially wrong in a part of the public sector feeling it was not answerable to either the Minister of the day or the Oireachtas.What sort of powers would this committee have, how would they be enforced and what would arise from non-cooperation?  What kind of findings would the committee make?  Much of this relates to whether the committee decides to focus purely on the evolution of law, and ideas to bring forward new legislation, or would it, like other petitions committees, have some right to investigate and handle complaints?  What would be the status of the findings?These are important considerations, and Senator Ryan will note that I did some substantial editing.  He left out the less complimentary part of what I said.

One point the group left out is that the Irish people are put off politics because we are not engaging in politics but in personal petty destruction of individual characters.  That is not good.We all have exchanges and sometimes use strong language in both Houses, which is the nature of politics but we should have a more calm and focused debate.  All these points are worthy of detailed study and assessment.  Such a committee could have a real role.  The Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges might like to consider and focus more clearly on some of my points.  If the all-party group permits, when it meets on 18 October, I would be quite willing, in line with my positive responses here, to put the group's considered view as the first item on the agenda, which is the appropriate place to discuss it.  The idea is good, and if we focus it we can take something positive out of it.  I must answer to people who wrote a script that suggests otherwise.  We have been talking for a long time in a kind of haze about the concept.  Perhaps I should say "maze" to make it clear that I do not refer to Senator Brian Hayes.

I am genuinely committed to and interested in creating a more vibrant role for the Seanad.  I share Senator O'Rourke's enthusiasm — she has beaten me on the head with it — for Seanad reform.  The committee I mentioned can focus on this issue in the short term.  I thank the Senators who tabled this Private Members' motion.  We should have debates of this nature more frequently.  I have outlined, without being destructive, some of the practical issues on which we need to decide.  When those issues have been dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which can do so easily, the all-party group can take it from there.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I warmly welcome the motion that has been tabled by the Labour Party Senators.  I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this issue regularly in the past few months.  I thank the Leader of the House for giving this matter such a positive airing when it has been highlighted on the Order of Business.I recall the first day the new Seanad met after the last election, almost four and a half years ago.  The over-riding concern of all the contributions made by Members on that day was the need to deal conclusively with the issue of Seanad reform.  It was suggested that all the previous reports should be put to one side so that we could get on with the job.  I compliment the Leader of the House on her tenacity in driving the process on an all-party basis, thereby allowing us to publish the report.  Like other Senators, I have been disappointed by the pace of the implementation of the report.A fundamental question, which is as relevant to the current Government as it would be to any other Government comprising any other collection of parties, needs to be addressed in any debate on Seanad reform.  Is the Government of the day prepared to take on this issue and to resolve it?  We should admit that the same questions would be asked if Fine Gael and any other Opposition parties were on the other side of the House.  We need to confront this fundamental question.  I do not think we can deal with this on a piecemeal basis.  The compromises which were reflected in the Seanad reform document represent the way forward in the reform agenda, broadly speaking.  We are facing a dilemma because we know that nothing will happen in the tail end of a Parliament.  I hope that whoever is in government after the next election can get on with allowing this House to reform itself.  I estimate that at least 80% of the contributions which were made on the first day the Seanad met after the last election were in support of the reform of the Seanad.The Minister, Deputy Roche, referred to the public consultation process, which was one of the most positive things that was done during the Seanad reform efforts.  Senators were involved in the public consultation process over the course of a week.  I was quite astonished by the number of written, oral and e-mail submissions which were received from groups and individuals which were interested in the process of Seanad reform.  When we placed public advertisements in the newspapers I thought nobody would reply and I was astonished by the response that was received.

It was proposed that any group that could be affected by legislation should be entitled to come to this Chamber to give Senators their considered views in advance of Second Stage.  The suggestion that has been made by Senator Tuffy and her colleagues is a better one, however, because it allows for a bottom-up approach to be taken when suggestions about public policy are being received.  I think we need to move towards such an approach.The principle of petitioning is established in the Seanad.  As I understand it, Private Bills can be initiated and sponsored by institutions or individuals outside the House.  For example, the House considered the Trinity College Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill 1997, which was sponsored by that institution, some years ago.  Private Bills can be proposed on the floor of the House.  I understand that under existing Standing Orders, amendments to Private Bills can be proposed by people who are not even Members of the House.  As I understand it, if one has a solicitor or a barrister positing one's amendment, that amendment can be tabled.  Senator Ryan has more knowledge and experience of this area than I have.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I managed to avoid that experience, much to my relief.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	280	We need to understand the principle that underpins Private Bills.  The Standing Orders which relate to Private Bills, rather than to the public business of this House, could well be the foundation of the acceptance of the proposal that has been made by Senator Tuffy.  If an Oireachtas committee establishes that an individual or an institution has a locus standi, it is within the rights of this House to allow a Bill to be promoted by that individual or institution.  We need to recognise that and see whether we can build on it.May I give an example of a matter that could be covered under the suggestion that has been made by Senator Tuffy?  I recently saw a terrific programme on Channel 4, in which the public was asked to nominate the 20 ugliest buildings in Britain.  The request for the public to get involved in architecture received an astonishing response from people in Scotland, England and Wales.  People from all parts of the United Kingdom submitted the names of the ugliest buildings in their communities.  Most of these wrecks of buildings were constructed in the post-modernist era of the 1960s.  The outcome of the vote was that the public believed it should have the power to delist buildings which are a blight on the architecture of their local communities.  Such buildings include ugly car parks, shopping centres and commercial facilities which are run down because their owners have moved off and local authorities are unable to take action.As a result of that programme, a new provision might be included in the United Kingdom's planning legislation to give the power to a community to initiate a process of delisting.  Senators will be aware that the people already have the power to list buildings, but there is no such power to delist buildings.  That core idea came from the public — nobody in a position of power had thought of it.

I have referred to that case as an example of many ideas which can be implemented.  Public services are never designed to meet the needs of the people who use them.

I think it is sensible that users of public services should be approached by public representatives when we are making decisions on best practice, codes and the manner in which services should interface with users.  Many suggestions could be made by the public in this manner.  A person living in my constituency telephoned me today to ask me why privacy windows are allowed in cars.  Who gave legal effect to the installation of blacked-out windows in cars?  Why should people be entitled to sit behind dark windows in their cars?  I understand that the practice was established by the Tokyo Mafia some years ago.

The person who contacted me earlier today asked me whether someone can do something about the practice.  The Government is not the font of all wisdom.  Not even the Opposition — God help us and protect us — is the font of all wisdom.  Many of the positive suggestions which are made by the public deserve a hearing.  They could be implemented in law if there were a forum in which they could be initiated.Regardless of the progress or lack of progress that is made by the all-party committee, perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in this House could consider Senator Tuffy's suggestion.  It could construct a working Standing Order to cater for this measure so that it can be launched.  I have outlined my personal view on Seanad reform — if we wait for a kind of omnibus agreement to be reached by everyone, nothing will happen.  If we can implement bits of reform as we go along, we should do so.  I welcome the suggestion that has been made by Senator Tuffy.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House and Senator Tuffy's Private Members' motion.  Her point on engaging with young people on environmental matters such as recycling and waste management is relevant.  The Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform, led by Senator O'Rourke, has done excellent work.  The Taoiseach has a particular interest in Seanad reform and volunteerism.  Last year in Cavan, the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party spent a weekend discussing community and volunteerism with Robert Putnam, who made an excellent contribution.  People are concerned about volunteerism.  Even in rural areas, it is now claimed that if it were not for community employment schemes, there would be no volunteers, even if it is just for putting up a village's Christmas lights.I organised one petition as a public representative to get 5,000 signatures to support a community hospital in Tuam, County Galway.  Thankfully the then Minister for Health and Children, and then Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, delivered on the hospital.  While other politicians organised other petitions, I am the only one in a photograph handing the 5,000 signatures to the Minister.There is a general concern that many who make decisions are based in Dublin with no adequate consultation and involvement with rural communities.  The National Roads Authority decided earlier this year that there would be only one access point on the Gort, County Galway, bypass.  A local community organisation, the Gort Regional Association for Community Enterprise, GRACE, compiled projections for houses to be built in the area, figures for school enrolment and the town's industry.  It was successful in convincing the roads authority that a second access was needed.  It was a great example of a local community getting across its message.  It is up to the organisation to persuade Galway County Council and the National Roads Authority western section to provide the funding for the local road network.  I thank the Minister for meeting GRACE when he visited Galway.Other local associations have done excellent work in highlighting their communities' views through research and public meetings.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland should meet with people in the west to discuss industrial development.  If that is not done, development will take place only in the larger urban centres.Many powers have been given away to semi-State bodies.  It is frustrating that issues with a board or a semi-State body cannot be raised in the House.  For example, I could not find out why it was decided to remove two railway services on the Galway-Dublin line last year.  Earlier this year, Bank of Ireland decided to shut its branch in Glenamaddy on 27 October.  There are four roads in and out of the town but Bank of Ireland took one.  While I accept this cannot be raised in the Seanad, there should be a consultation process with local communities on these matters.The Tidy Towns competition is a great example of community involvement.  Some of the marking reports for towns involved can be hard-hitting but they point out how communities can improve their environments.  The Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill is a good example where in urban areas people can get involved.  The RAPID and CLÁR programmes offer the same opportunity to rural areas.A petitions system to initiate legislation and debate is a move in the right direction for community development and involvement.  I congratulate Senator Tuffy on tabling this motion.  I hope the all-party sub-committee will make progress on Seanad reform.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The concept of a petitions system is important because it involves the engagement between people and parliament.  I was a member of the Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform with Senators O'Rourke, Brian Hayes, Dardis and Ryan.  It was on this committee that this issue was first raised.  When considering Seanad reform, I examined the process in other Parliaments.  I was interested in the New Zealand model because it moved from a bicameral to a unicameral system.  As it was a Westminster, Anglophone style Parliament, I was curious how it managed this change.  In its Bills procedure, it had a five Stages system similar to our own.  When it moved over to a unicameral system, extra Stages were simply added.  In effect, there were three different forms of Second Stage.  The last form of Second Stage allowed for amendments made by a special committee to examine that Stage.  This part of the Stage required the New Zealand Parliament to invite civic groups to make representations on the legislation.My report facilitated discussion of this issue by the Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform.  Such a system can work well, even in a country like New Zealand which presents geographical difficulties, being a long, narrow country.  The parliamentarians employed various strategies.  If they believed a group had genuine locus standi and relevant insight on a particular issue, they would pay its expenses to come to Wellington and make a presentation.  At other times, the special Second Stage committee went out to meet people in their localities.  This worked well and it is something I recommend in our case.We should also look to some of the existing Oireachtas committees.  I made a propsal to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that it should visit Gaeltacht areas to listen to and talk with people there, but it could not find its way to do this.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, on the other hand, is already engaged in such activity.  Senator Kitt has attended one of its meetings in Ballinasloe in his own constituency.These meetings are attended by a wide range of people, from business, labour, chamber of commerce and educational backgrounds.  In addition, the committee always invites local post-primary school pupils to make a brief presentation.  I believed this element to be ground breaking.  Speaking recently about the connection between education and industry, however, a senior industrialist told me that the organisers of trade shows in Germany, which is the most advanced state in Europe in this regard, all insist that local post-primary schools are involved and contribute to the exhibitions.I raised the issue of consultation with interested groups with the Leader some time ago.  At the time the Disability Bill was going through the House, we agreed in principle it was an obvious example of where such consultaiton could work.  There were so many groups with clearly defined disability agendas and the idea was that we would seek their views on Second Stage.  This never came about but I do not blame the Leader for that; the fault lay with all of us.  I invited some of these groups in for discussions after Second Stage but this contact turned out to be more of a briefing than the engagement which I envisaged.A consultative approach can work.  Senator Ryan will be extremely pleased to hear that I was at a meeting on Monday night where the general cry related to the difficulties people encounter in trying to talk to parliamentarians and put their view across on a particular issue.  This was at a meeting i nDaingean Uí Chúis nuair a bhíodar ag plé ainm na háite.  The attendees would sincerely  welcome the opportunity to come and talk to Oireachtas Members chun ath-mheon mar gheall ar an díospóireacht seo atá ar siúl a chur faoi bhráid an Oireachtais.  Their belief was that the legislation in question went through the Acht teanga while they were effectively deprived of any form of consultation.  I am no longer jousting with Senator Ryan; this is a serious point.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Did Senator O'Toole hear the song about the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív?
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	That Bill took away the rights of people in the Gaeltacht to have a say in the name of their own place, a right enjoyed by everybody outside the Gaeltacht.  This is not the place to argue the rights and wrong of that case but it is a good example of the issue we are discussing.  It would have been useful in this case if we had known, through a process of consultation before this legislation was enacted, what its impact might be, how any issues might be dealt with and, later on, how it was working and how it might or should be changed.  Other Members have given different legislative examples.Although it is cumbersome, I have seen how well the consultative process works in the New Zealand Parliament.  At a time when there is such a lack of respect for the political world, we must encourage people to engage in the work we do and we must be seen to be listening and taking on board their views.  People understand when they cannot get their way and when others disagree with them.  Allowing interested persons to engage in such a consultative process is akin to giving them a day in court.  People want to make their case, engage in argumentation and discussions, and listen to and make proposals.  Such a process can be only valuable.Perhaps a way of getting this off the ground would be to choose some legislation that will come through the House in the near future and agree to a process of consultation with interest groups with clearly defined agendas, as opposed to lobbyists.  These groups could be invited to the House to talk to us on Second Stage or we can agree to go to them.  I am aware there is an issue in this regard because Members of this House do not sit on select committees.  There is nothing to stop us, however, from forming a select committee to deal with one Bill, or we could set up a joint select committee to try out this.  I ask the Minister to keep in mind such a scheme as a way of testing this process.  It would cost us nothing, pose no risks and would be well worthwhile.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	293	As Members spoke, I observed what a wonderfully constructive debate this is.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to listen to the high standard of debate.I begin by saying "Well done" to Senator Tuffy.  She spoke about this issue on the Order of Business last May but I was not aware she planned to bring forward a motion during Private Members' business.  It is a constructive and interesting debate and Senator Tuffy has clearly done her homework.  She must have had somebody downloading information for a good portion of the day.  Her ideas in regard to the Scottish Parliament are interesting because there are many remote areas in that jurisdiction where people may feel far removed geographically from power.  She suggests a process by which either parliamentarians might meet people in their own areas or else people might come to meet the petitions committee.  Senator Tuffy did not simply put down the motion and waffle on; she had her ideas on the issue and she put them forward.The philosophical debate which followed has been equally useful.  Everybody who spoke had fine ideas.  I listened with enthusiasm to Senator O'Toole.  I do not recall the visit to New Zealand but it was interesting because it is based on the same idea.  The New Zealand Parliament did away with the upper house and found itself having to invent a senate-like arrangement because it was dissatisfied with the resulting vacuum.The Minister and I are in agreement that the House should not divide on this issue because there is widespread agreement on it among Members of all parties.  All the Fianna Fáil Senators said at our party meeting that they wished this to be an all-party issue.  We want the Minister and Government to co-operate with us on this, as I said in the House this morning.The Seanad reform programme has gone nowhere in the past 18 months.  I do not mean to castigate anybody but this is a fact.  It is not good enough.  As Senator Brian Hayes said, everybody who spoke was in favour of Seanad reform.  As he knows, however, the difficulties arise when it comes to the question of how Members are elected to the House.  Apart from the university representatives, who are elected by a separate process, Members of this House are elected by the will of county councils and other local authorities.  This is where everybody did a runner from the prospect of real reform; they wanted to be radical but not yet.The Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform came up with many recommendations that we could have implemented.  The seed of what Senator Tuffy has proposed was contained in that committee's discussions on the need for consultation with the public.  Some 158 groups responded to the public advertisement relating to the work of the committee.  It was an amazing response.  I remember seeing the advertisements the day they first appeared in the newspapers and thinking nobody would want to come.  People flocked in, however, in a breathtaking public response.  Two ushers guided them in every day at stated times and we did not have enough time to handle the volume of public interest.We have let down people because we have not moved on this issue as we said we would.  I propose we be selectively radical and take this proposal as a way forward because the germ of it was in our wish to engage with people prior to the formulation of legislation.  Of course, civil servants would hate this because it would mean more work for them, it would mean they would have to attend these meetings.  It is not that they are lazy, they do not want to rock boats.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, knows this, as someone who has tried to rock boats.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I cannot hear what the Senator is saying, and I have quite good hearing.The key to this motion lies in deciding how to get started, to settle on the format of the petitions committee.  We talk about the disconnect between Europe and the public, but people perceive a disconnect between parliament and the public and Senator Kitt spoke evocatively on this point.  Public representatives conduct clinics, collect representations, write to the housing office, the Health Service Executive and so on.  They receive replies, pass them on, follow up on them and make related phone calls.  I only realise now how much it entails.  However, in a philosophical way, there is a disconnect between Parliament and the people.Surely the Seanad can provide a forum in which this disconnect can be addressed, whether it be here or another location.  We could advertise that the committee would visit certain places on certain days.  This is a community matter, as Senator Kitt pointed out, where a group may decide to do something.  For example, if public opinion rose up in response to a bank's earnings, the bank could reinvest some of its profits locally towards community service.  The farmers of that area may have been prime customers for many years.I approve of this idea and the Minister has spoken strongly in favour of it but it is important we decide how to give expression to it.  I would like to start working on this matter, rather than continue talking about it.  I would like it applied to the Aran Islands, for instance.I always feel that Senator McHugh speaks authentically and he passionately gives vent to particular geographical ills.  He approached the issue of cancer and women who could not travel from Donegal to Dublin in the same manner.  This was also the case this morning on the subject of fishing ports and the quota system.  That is an issue in which one could become deeply involved.We must put some shape on this issue. The ideas are all in place as the Scottish Parliament has laid it out.  The Minister has proposed the next meeting of the all party group for 18 October and the first item should be the setting up of a petitions committee and establishing its remit.Senator O'Toole made a fair point on legislation.  The five sectoral plans of the five Departments are going to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  I propose, instead of simply accepting this, we debate it when it comes back to this House.  Prior to that we should meet the disability groups to hear what their input has been and how they feel the five sectoral plans for the five Departments will be implemented.  Will they mean anything to such groups?  If we owe any community groups we owe groups representing the disadvantaged and the disabled.  We should get the report from the committee and invite group representatives to this House to hear what they have to say.I am happy that the Seanad has heard many fine contributions to this debate.  I look forward to us putting our foot on the ladder of radicalism which this initiative represents.  The omens look good for Senator Tuffy in an electoral sense, though I know saying that usually spells doom.  I do not mean to imply electoral doom for Senator Tuffy.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I thank the Leader of the House for the warm welcome she has given to this motion and for using her influence in the major Government party to win support for it.  I commend Senator Tuffy on bringing forward this important motion.  As Senator Ryan said, she has been dogged in her determination.It is opportune that we should debate it at this time, against the background of a discussion of politics, public life and the public's reaction to politics and politicians.  The biggest joke at a social occasion I attended last Sunday was that in Ireland we have the best politicians money can buy.  I did not find that funny and I do not like that kind of remark.  We have been the butt of cynical jokes for a long time, not just at the moment.  A petitions committee would not, in itself, restore public confidence in politics and politicians but it would have a positive impact.  It would indicate that we are willing to reach out and listen to people.I agree with everything Senator O'Rourke said and I agree that we should get started on this initiative as soon as possible.  We need to create mechanisms to allow the public understand that they have an input into the system.Consider the manner in which the Health Service Executive was established and before it the National Roads Authority.  Democratically elected politicians have been removed from the process of decision making and accountability in important areas of Irish life.  The health boards are gone and the system did need reform but I do not believe it was necessary to remove a whole layer of democratic accountability.  This has contributed to politicians' frustration in trying to get answers on the health service and I believe it has added to the public's frustration and sense of distance from the decision making process.  This kind of approach is regressive and is having a negative impact.Large numbers of people protest in places such as Monaghan, Ennis and Nenagh partly because they feel the decisions made by bodies such as the HSE are undemocratic and that those in charge cannot be held to account.  This engenders a sense of frustration and powerlessness in communities.  This motion is, therefore, very important.This Seanad and the previous Seanad will have heard me raise the issue of the Silvermines on more than one occasion.  Thanks to the determination of a number of people and the willingness  of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, to listen, we have, effectively, resolved that issue.  When I started working with that group some years ago it did not know where to go or who would listen.  I suggested we would take the issue wherever necessary, be it the floor of the Seanad, the committee or to the Minister.  The general reaction was that no one would have any reason to listen.  It worked, as it should in that case.An elected representative, supported by other elected representatives, was able to raise an issue and have it resolved, thus providing a very good example of how a community got heard.  The process is not available to everybody and many feel excluded from it in that it does not work for them.  In such cases, the petitions committee would serve as a very important arena.  It has become increasingly important because of the examples to which I referred.Senator Tuffy provided an example from abroad of children coming forward with their idea and I was heartened to hear about it.  It is not just a case of considering big, high-flown ideas, although they obviously would be very welcome, but also of training young people and children to understand how the democratic process can work for them and showing them they can have a direct input.  We could work with the Ombudsman for Children in this regard.  I would not be surprised if we had a proposal from young people to extend the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  Perhaps we could consider this as well.Feelings of disconnection from democracy and powerlessness are on the increase.  As Senator O'Rourke pointed out, elected representatives are negotiating with State agencies, local authorities and, in many cases, non-State agencies on behalf of the public.  This is obviously our role and it is very important and I do not believe a petitions committee would detract from it or dilute it in any way.  As Senator O'Rourke stated, it would broaden and expand participation and bring the Members of the House closer to the people.  It would create an avenue for connection and dialogue and, I hope, allow people to realise it is possible to influence the system.  I hope it might engender some idealism about politics to counter the cynicism of the times.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, having had the privilege last year and in recent months of listening to the various groups that participated in the Seanad reform process.  It is timely, at this stage of the Seanad's term, that we take some action, try to be radical and implement what we all discussed in the House in great detail.My experience of dealing with community groups and various other lobby groups leads me to believe the community policing forum is one of the most successful models for participation by individuals, residents' groups and disability groups.  It affords direct interaction with public representatives, State agencies, the Garda, Dublin City Council, the Department of Health and Children and other groups.  The forum can even address simple matters such as the location of bus stops.  The forum meets three times per year and those in attendance can raise issues and propose ideas.  It is ideal for this purpose and is working successfully.  I am delighted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has agreed to the enhancement of the various fora throughout the city.  The introduction of the policing committee is a good step in this direction.As the Minister stated, having a forum at which the public can discuss legislation is useful.  We all have been lobbied by various groups and my experience of this over recent years is that the very well-organised and resourced groups are the ones that get what they are looking for.  The smaller ones, which have a lesser voice, lose out on whatever resources are available purely because they have not got the stamina, as Senator Ryan stated.  It has been the case that such groups could not keep up the fight.  At every turn they felt barriers were being put in their way, whereas the larger organisations had more resources and the ability to spend money, produce glossy presentations and employ people on a full-time basis to make their case.  Every year the same groups make their pre-budget submissions at the expense of the smaller groups.  Any proposal that would give a voice to a small group, an individual or larger group such as a residents' association would be helpful.We deal with many community councils, which are formed on foot of a number of residents' associations coming together as an umbrella group.  They find this is the best way to influence their local politicians.  In my constituency there are a number of community councils.  They raise various local issues and are quite successful, but this is because they are umbrella groups and have the extra strength to influence public representatives, especially at local level.Local area committees allow local councillors to sit face to face with lobbyists and call on various lobby groups.  The proposed measure is a step forward in enhancing the relationship between local public representation and national public representation.  Any measure that gives a voice to those who feel they are disconnected can only be of help.This is a timely motion and not just for the Seanad, because it is linked to a large body of policy concerning the task force on active citizenship.  Last month I had the privilege of attending a task force gathering in Croke Park at which there were more than 400 people from all walks of life representing all types of groups, including groups representing the disabled, disadvantaged, men and women.  The atmosphere in the room on the morning in question was amazing because everyone present was giving time freely to contribute to the task force.One of the main reasons for the existence of the task force is to encourage people to become more actively involved in their communities.  If people are to be encouraged to become involved, they first must be asked to do so, but if nobody asks them, they will not bother.  Politicians all know how difficult it is to get people to vote in the first place, never mind getting them to vote in a particular way.  We have run campaigns in my constituency encouraging people to register to vote and explaining the electoral process.  As public representatives, it is our duty to ensure people are encouraged in this regard.  We must make it easy for them to participate.It has been suggested by the Minister that the initiative will be covered at the next meeting.  I presume the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will discuss it at some stage.

I am delighted to note that backing comes not only from the Opposition but from the Government, courtesy of the Leader of the Seanad.  When Senator Tuffy raised the establishment of a petitions committee on 15 June 2006, in No. 26, motion No. 20 on the Order Paper, Senator O'Rourke described it as follows.It is an excellent motion.  I hope Senator Tuffy puts it forward in Private Members' time.  I will seek, if I can, that we do not put forward an amendment and that this House will accept it.She did so and deserves our acknowledgment in that regard.  This morning she referred to the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, had some reservations on the matter.

I hope that it will also be acted upon.  It is one thing to accept a motion, but to follow through is another.  Such co-operation begs the question of whether this jaded Government is running out of ideas and initiatives of its own.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	308	That is a new twist.  One agrees to something, and one is jaded.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Such co-operation on behalf of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government is rare and therefore open to suspicion.  With such unprecedented backing, there is nothing to stop the committee from being up and running before Christmas if we pass this motion, which enjoys unanimous support.The Labour Party document on Dáil reform, Putting our House in Order 2003, which is being followed up in the motion this evening, referred to the establishment of a committee of investigations, oversight and petitions in the section dealing with parliamentary inquiries.  Once again, I thank Senator Tuffy.  There was also reference to "citizens' petitions" in A Dáil for the New Millennium, the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats proposals for parliamentary reform published in December 2000.  However, like many other Government proposals, it has died a death and has not been acted on or followed up.The press appears to have been strangely silent on this issue, and I could find no media discussion of what I believe to be a very interesting concept with far-reaching implications for individuals and community groups and organisations and surely worthy of being set out for public consumption.The right to petition reaches back to Magna Carta in 1215.  Historically, a petition was a written request stating a grievance and requesting relief from a ruling authority.  Since each petition commanded legislative consideration, citizens in large part controlled legislative agendas.  The right to petition a government is a freedom firmly upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States, proving that it is considered an inalienable right by the US Government.Today, the right of citizens to petition Parliament is also part of the political structure of several other countries, including the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Germany.  Such a petition is typically a request for action with regard to legislation, repealing legislation or for a particular purpose.  They give a voice to members of the public to express concerns and opinions to parliament.  Some, but not all, Parliaments that accept public petitions have petitions committees such as that proposed this evening to process petitions received.Currently under review in the UK, the system of public petitions is referred to by the select committee on modernisation of the House of Commons as a "significant avenue for communication between the public and Parliament".  The committee sorted and classified the petitions as well as deciding if they were in order under the rules of the house.  In Australia, each House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, has its own rules with regard to the acceptance of petitions.  Members present valid petitions on behalf of petitioners on the floor of the relevant House, with such a presentation not meaning that the member necessarily agrees with the petition.  The relevant Minister may then reply to the petition in the House or respond directly to a petition, with all petitions printed in the official record of debates.The function of a petitions committee is typically to assess the validity of a petition and decide how it should be dealt with.  Such committees have been established in several countries, including Scotland, Israel and Germany.  In Scotland, petitions are submitted to the public petitions committee for consideration.  It may then be forwarded by the committee to another body, usually another committee.  The Scottish Parliament also has a highly innovative e-petitions system to enable petitions to attract support on the Parliament's website.In Germany, the petitions committee has a staff of around 80 to cope with the heavy workload involved with the number of petitions it receives, on average around 20,000 a year.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	311	For us in the Seanad, the potential of such a committee is enormous.  While the Seanad has the freedom to look at issues that are perhaps not always on the political radar, we may not be as effective in dealing with public concerns and suggestions as we should be.  It seems to me that we have a case in point in the Government Green Paper on energy, which was as noteworthy for what it left out as for what was in it, and it might have benefited from such a committee.  Ideas on the environment and regarding the economic instability threatened by rising energy costs might come from petitions to such a committee.Constitutional reform would no doubt be an important part of the committee's work, with particular reference to the rights of minorities.  Notwithstanding Senator Norris's Bill on civil unions, a concept that my party was the first to favour as far back as 2004, more could be discussed in this House and the Oireachtas in general on issues relating to the gay community, not least the disgraceful level of homophobic violence, particularly in Dublin.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	313	There have been many false dawns in the debate on the role of the Seanad, but we must make it more efficient and relevant to the general public.  This motion is a worthy addition to that reform agenda.  I am delighted but, as I said, suspicious of Government co-operation, which more than anything sends out a clear message that it is on its way out.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The Senator is not on the way in.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I welcome the Minister to the House and am very glad that the Labour Party has put forward this interesting suggestion, which would certainly formalise all the initiatives brought to our attention by e-mail, letter, telephone call and so forth.  It would be very useful from that perspective.  They will also be interested in answering all the questions put forward.  There is another one, however, I should put forward as well.  At the moment we are all like Sir Boyle Roche's bird, trying to be two places at the same time, serving on committees and sub-committees.  This will stretch us even further.  Some people believe that the Members of the Upper House are not as occupied as in fact they are.  This will be another challenge, especially when I hear from Senator Bannon that the German committee got 20,000 petitions.  That is an astonishing number.  When one takes it on a pro rata basis for the citizens of this country, there will be thousands coming in.When we have debates on development aid, as we did this afternoon, I always ask the governments of developing countries to encourage more involvement from civil society.  It would indeed be very wrong if I did not support greater involvement of civil society in the making of legislation here.  After all, initiatives are being taken by bodies in this country.  Why should not the Oireachtas be another one?  Dublin Bus is always seeking suggestions from  passengers as to how it should move forward, what routes to examine and where there should be bus stops.  There are precedents from which this type of committee might gain.The National Forum on Europe, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, has been a great success.  The meetings in Dublin and around the country that I have attended have always attracted a large number of people.  The Third Pillar, as we describe it, is always very well represented by various representatives from civil society.  It is  good, too, that the involvement of young people in that forum has been so much promoted, with speaking competitions for schools and people outside schools.  Senator Brady talked earlier about voting and how we are trying to encourage people to come out and vote.  I am always alarmed that so many people in civil society do not realise what a privilege it is to have a vote and be able to exercise it freely.It is very disappointing to me to see the way the new EU member states from Eastern Europe have had such a poor voter turnout in recent elections.  It is astonishing when one sees how crucial democracy is for those countries and voting levels are only 50% to 60%.  Then, of course, there are even lower levels of voting in America.  It is very important to keep telling people that civil society should be involved in democracy in a meaningful way in our countries.The National Forum on Europe gets questions from other countries about setting up similar forums as well.  We should look more closely at the petitions committees in other countries.  The Labour Party, I am sure, will answer the Minister's questions and we shall see how we go forward from there.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I welcome in general the consensus in the debate and the very thoughtful contributions about the proposal from both sides of the House.  I welcome the Minister's positive attitude to the proposal.  I should be gratified if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges set the ball rolling, as he said.  Senator O'Rourke has suggested that this should be the first item on the next agenda of that committee.The Minister asked what type of remit we had in mind.  The issues to be raised are those that are within our remit.  That is the way it works in other Parliaments.  It is not just confined to other Parliaments.  Councils and state legislatures have it in other countries, for example in the USA.  Similarly, in Germany the landers, at a lower level than the Bundestag, have it.  Those matters that are appropriate to local authorities should be dealt with by them.  We would not be dealing, for example, with the issue raised by the Earl of Mayo, which related to how to fix the local footpath or road.  That type of issue could be referred to a local government.  We see that type of thing already in our committees.Scotland and Germany both try to ensure that inappropriate material is not submitted.  Guidelines are given and they have procedures on how to deal with inappropriate material.  In Germany, for example, there is no obligation to deal with anonymous or confused petitions — or petitions that might affect pending court cases and so on.  In Scotland, before a petition may be put one has to have carried out certain steps.  Basically this involves clarifying whether one made representations to the Scottish Executive or sought the assistance of locally elected representatives such as councillors, MSPs and so on.  In submitting the petition the steps that preceded it must be set out.  It is important that we look at other examples, although that of the Scottish Parliament is particularly relevant.As regards other matters raised, a grievances committee is not envisaged.  It is not that type of petition.  Senator Bannon mentioned the Labour Party document.  That document did not go as far as suggesting what I am proposing here, which would be much more substantial and includes the right of the public to initiate proposals.  It would not deal with the types of issues the Ombudsman deals with and so on.As regards other discussions, Senator Brian Hayes mentioned the Private Members' Bills, something I had not thought of.  I had one before me, which was done by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  It is important to look at that and see how this type of arrangement is processed through the House at the moment.  It would need to be developed, however, and there would have to be much broader scope.  Colleges and such institutions would have solicitors, etc.  The idea is not to have someone submitting a fully fledged Bill, but rather a proposal or suggestion.  It basically would be about trying to move forward the type of idea as suggested by Senator Brian Hayes.Senator Kitt mentioned voluntarism and the projects started by the Taoiseach in this regard.  There is a problem with voluntarism, but where petitions committees exist in other countries they have been enormously successful in this area.  Senator Bannon mentioned the example of Germany where they get 20,000 petitions a year.  That of course is a much larger population.  Since they started in Scotland they have received 1,000 petitions altogether.Senator O'Rourke asked whether we would have thousands of petitions.  There is a risk of that but we would need to embrace it.  That is what other jurisdictions have done.  A certain amount of background work has been done with the e-consultation process as regards the broadcasting Bill.All speakers made good points.  I want to return to what Senator O'Rourke said: "That the Seanad can provide a forum for that disconnect."  I totally agree with her and believe this would be the ideal forum.  Senator O'Rourke took the initiative as regards bringing people into this House to ask them questions, for example, on European Parliament issues.  That was a very welcome initiative.  She set a precedent that hopefully other Leaders of the House will replicate in the future.Senators O'Rourke, Brian Hayes and others noted that much could be done without the full reform of the Seanad.  Pending that many steps can be taken and this is a small thing we can do which would be very positive.  It could make a real difference as regards participation and civil engagement with the Seanad — and through that, with the Oireachtas.The Constitution does not have to be amended.  We do not need the go-ahead from any Department and it is something we can do ourselves.  I welcome in particular the Leader's response to the proposal and look forward to working with the Seanad in terms of trying to progress it in the future.

On the first occasion, I referred to the fact that Glenamaddy lost a bank in August.  It may have done so but I hope it is about to gain a sewerage scheme.The town of Glenamaddy is famous because the song "Four Roads to Glenamaddy" was written about it.  The town has grown over the years, is the home of some good industrial interests and €7 million has been granted for the provision of a new community school there.  In addition, there are many new housing developments in the town.  It has, however, been badly affected by the fact that a sewerage scheme to improve facilities there has not been approved.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to indicate that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or his Department will be making an announcement in this regard in the near future.The most recent information I received from Galway County Council was that a preliminary report and a water pricing policy report had been forwarded to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The council also indicated that additional information was sought under the provisions of circular L1/06.  I hope this information is now with the Department and that approval can be given for the scheme, which forms part of a bundle with other schemes.  It is vital that this necessary sewerage scheme be put in place in Glenamaddy to allow further development in the town to proceed.I hope the Minister of State can provide some information and I thank him for coming before the House to deal with this matter.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I thank Senator Kitt for raising this issue.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, regrets that he is unable to be present to respond to the motion.The water services investment programme 2005-07, published by the Minister in December 2005, includes some 60 major water and sewerage schemes, with a value of more than €451 million, for Galway.  I am pleased to confirm that the Glenamaddy sewerage scheme is one of these schemes and that it is scheduled for a 2007 start in the investment programme.  The funding has been allocated to build the scheme and it will be able to proceed to construction when the planning and procurement procedures have been completed.The current position is that Galway County Council's preliminary report and water services pricing policy report for the scheme are being examined by the Department.  I am assured that a response will issue to the council in the near future.  Approval of the preliminary report will allow the council to draw up contract documents — a major step forward towards the construction phase.As the cost of the scheme is under €5 million it will benefit from the more streamlined procurement procedures the Minister introduced earlier this year to speed up progress with the many water and sewerage schemes planned throughout the country.  When the preliminary report has been approved, the council will be free to proceed to construction with the collection system, without any further reference to the Department.  The new wastewater treatment plant is being built as a public private partnership.  The successful bidder will design and build the plant and then operate it for the council for a period of 20 years.  This will mean the most up-to-date technology will be used and the highest quality wastewater treatment standards will prevail at all times.The scheme is important for the local community.  It will ensure that current problems with sewage disposal will be eliminated, that there will be capacity to service new development and that environmental standards will be preserved and improved for the benefit of the town and its residents.The Senator may rest assured that the Minister is keen to see the scheme get under way quickly and that the necessary funding is available in his department for Galway County Council to draw down as soon as it is needed.  The Minister and his Department will do everything they can to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays with the project and that this important new infrastructure is delivered to the people of Glenamaddy as quickly as possible.

The Government should give an immediate commitment to the date for the liberalisation of postal services.It has come to my attention that at least one company is staying out of the postal services market because of the situation with An Post and its lack of confidence in the ability of the Minister to provide a firm declaration that the postal services will be liberalised on 1 January 2009, as is expected but not confirmed.  I ask the Minister of State to provide that confirmation.  The company to which I refer, DX Ireland, is authorised by ComReg to provide postal services in Ireland.  However, it will not enter the postal market until it is assured that it will be able to compete on a level playing field with An Post.There are certain reasons companies proposing to enter the market feel that An Post has certain advantages with which it cannot compete.  They are not operating on a level playing field and fair competition does not exist.  An Post is a dinosaur — a monopoly which should be hewn down so that other players can gain entry to the market.I will briefly outline the problems with which new entrants to the market are confronted.  The first is that only 40% to 50% of the postal services are open to competition.  This is particularly noticeable in the area of weight where An Post has a particular advantage over any entrants into the market.The second difficulty is that uniform pricing for An Post, which everybody believes exists, is a myth.  The statutory instrument covering the activities of An Post — which was signed by the Minister — states that An Post can do deals with individual customers.  In other words, it does not have to insist upon uniform pricing in all circumstances.  For new entrants coming to the market this means a monopoly like An Post can not just compete with them on product, but can introduce and indulge itself in predatory pricing, undercutting the new competitor and thereby putting it out of business.  It can behave like a vulture in a really monopolistic way.  Below cost selling is a trick that it could get up to.The third reason why new entrants, and DX Ireland in particular, will not come into the market unless a firm and convincing commitment is given, is that the High Court may, on the application of An Post, prohibit other entrants from this market.  This should not be on an application from An Post — it should surely be done on the application of ComReg.  This particular clause allows An Post to abuse a monopoly position.  The other advantage it gives to such a large State monopoly with deep pockets is that it can delay the small company from going into business for so long that it will never be able to compete.  Indeed it might even go beyond the 2009 deadline when it can compete if the Minister were to give us this commitment.The other reason competition should be introduced is the utter incompetence of the Irish postal service.  The latest figures from ComReg suggest that only 74% of mail is delivered the next day.  This is a 2% decline on the previous quarter, and shows a consistent trend of decline in efficiency by An Post over the last four quarters.  An Post is falling well short of its targets.  In its last quarterly report, ComReg said it was disappointed that An Post was not meeting any targets.My final point relates to the treatment of VAT, where An Post does not charge VAT but where, in certain circumstances, new entrants must charge it.  This is utterly unfair.  It is a really serious deterrent and must be ended by Government statutory instrument or order as soon as possible.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I thank Senator Ross for raising this issue. Minister Dempsey regrets that he is unable to be in the House this evening to address the Senator on this matter.The Government recognises the critical importance of having nationwide, reliable, high quality and efficient postal services.  However, we must recognise that the challenges facing the postal sector now at the start of the 21st century are not the same challenges that faced us at the start of the 20th century, or even those we faced at the end of that century.The economy and society at large also need strong and vibrant postal services in light of the many internationally traded sectors operating in the country.  It also needs An Post to be competitive.  There is universal agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future.The Government also believes that liberalisation and the expected increase in competition ultimately will be good for both An Post and consumers.  Like all businesses, if An Post is to prosper and grow, then it must adapt to the demands of its customers and place delivery of quality services to its customers as its primary focus and objective.An Post operates within a regulatory framework as enshrined in EU law in European Directives 97/67/EC and 2002/39/EC.  These directives set out the requirements for member states regarding the provision of high quality postal services.  Both of these directives have been transposed into Irish law in Statutory Instrument 616 of 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations.  Furthermore, the directives also provide for the liberalisation of the postal market.Competition has arrived in the postal sector in Ireland and will intensify in the coming years.  Currently, there are 29 firms with a postal service authorisation from ComReg operating in Ireland.  Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004.  The parcels business is liberalised, with major international players operating in the Irish market.  An Post now holds only 25% of the parcels market in this country.  The weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area and therefore not open to competition was reduced to 100g in 2003 with a price limit of three times the basic tariff for domestic and inbound international.  The reserved area was further reduced to mail weighing 50g or less and two and a half times the basic tariff from 2006 for domestic and inbound international.The current postal directive will expire on 31 December 2008 and it is expected that any new postal directive will be adopted by 2007.  As provided for in the current postal directive, a study was recently undertaken by the EU on the impact on the universal service of the full accomplishment of a liberalised postal market.  Based on the outcome of this study, the Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and Council by 31 December 2006 accompanied by a proposal confirming, if appropriate, the date of 2009 for the full liberalisation of the postal market or to determine alternative steps in light of the study's conclusions.The Government has no plans at this stage to bring forward the date of further liberalisation of the remaining postal services that are currently exempt from competition.  Issues that will be important for Ireland in the context of this new postal directive will include the protection of the universal service in a liberalised market, ensuring that Irish citizens continue to receive a broad suite of postal services; the development of a postal market so that new competitively-priced products and services are available to customers and; the continued viability of An Post in the face of open competition along with the necessity to safeguard against big players coming in and cherry picking at the expense of the less commercially attractive parts of the country.  Any proposed postal directive and changes to the universal service will, of course, be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny.Irish consumers deserve a quality of service comparable to that received by consumers anywhere else in Europe.  A quality postal service is important in the context of a modern competitive economy like Ireland's.  The way forward for our postal services is to ensure we have, on the one hand, adequate competition and, on the other, no diminution of the universal service.  The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focused An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I would like to ask a supplementary question.  By way of remark I would say that the Minister of State's reply is not satisfactory.  It does not answer any of the questions which I posed.  This is, by its very nature, the form of this debate when the Minister comes here with a script.  The script is preordained and it means he never addresses the issues raised by Senators on the Adjournment.  It is something we should note.Will the Minister of State confirm and guarantee that the Government will fully liberalise the postal services by 1 January 2009?

I understand the staff have been recruited for quite some time.  There was a little disappointment in Newcastle West because we thought the new staff would be trained there, but I understand the training is being carried out in Limerick.  Several staff have asked me what has been happening because it is quite some time since the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, had an official photocall to put up a sign outside the original county council offices stating that this site would be part of the decentralisation programme.  He had an entourage of Progressive Democrats public representatives from throughout the county to help him put up the sign stating that this site was to be the location of the office but I pass that location frequently and I have not seen any construction activity.  Will the Minister of State indicate when construction will commence and when it is likely that office will be opened?
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I thank Senator Finucane for raising the issue.  The Minister for Finance announced a decentralisation programme for 10,300 public servants in December 2003, to be implemented on a voluntary basis.  The success of the programme can be seen from the fact that decentralisation is now a reality in 12 new locations and that more than 2,000 civil servants will have relocated to 29 locations by the end of 2007.  This demonstrates the level of interest in relocating among public servants.  It is also an endorsement of the ability of public service managers to effectively manage the staffing, business and property issues arising.  Staff are being assigned to decentralised posts and are being trained in advance of their decentralisation to new locations which are being acquired by the OPW.Included in the Government decision was a requirement for Revenue to decentralise 50 staff to Newcastle West.  Following consultation with the Management Advisory Committee and Revenue's Partnership Committee, the board of the Revenue Commissioners decided that all debt management functions in Dublin would be decentralised, apart from a small number of staff who will be retained on insolvency work, to the greater mid-west area, including Newcastle West.The Office of Public Works considered a range of options to meet the accommodation needs of Revenue in Newcastle West resulting in a decision to procure new accommodation in Newcastle West on the basis of a design build solution.I understand from the Office of the Public Works that it has identified a preferred tenderer who will shortly be submitting a planning application in respect of this accommodation.  On receipt of satisfactory planning permission, a contract for construction of the building will be placed by the OPW.  If matters progress according to schedule, it is anticipated that building work should commence early in the new year with completion for 2008.In the interim, and pending the availability of accommodation in Newcastle West, it was decided that the operation to be relocated to Newcastle West by the Revenue Commissioners would be established on a temporary basis in Limerick.  The decision to proceed with a temporary solution in Limerick was taken on the basis that this would be the optimum approach to ensuring that the Newcastle West team could be provided with appropriate training while minimising disruption to the ongoing business of the division.The decision also had regard to the fact that the majority of staff who had elected to transfer to Newcastle West were currently serving in Limerick and could therefore be brought together in that location without significant disturbance.  This approach was approved by the Decentralisation Implementation Group.The Office of Public Works was requested to identify appropriate temporary accommodation in Limerick.  This temporary accommodation has been secured in Estuary House, Limerick.  The Newcastle West team was put in place in July 2006 and the debt management functions that are due to be administered from Newcastle West are being undertaken by this team.The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that as soon as the new accommodation is available in Newcastle West, Revenue will be in a position to commence operations in that office immediately.
