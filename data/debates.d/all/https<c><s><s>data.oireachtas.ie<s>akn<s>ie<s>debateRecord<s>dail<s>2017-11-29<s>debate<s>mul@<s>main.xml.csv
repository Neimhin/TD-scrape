#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	There is growing concern that the local employment service and jobs clubs are being increasingly marginalised by JobPath. I seek an assurance that the local employment service has a future, and that it will not be abolished or privatised.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Ireland’s Public Employment Service is managed by my Department and delivered by its Intreo service as well as by contracted private companies such as JobPath, Local Employment Service, LES, and job club providers. For 2017, as in 2016, my Department contracted with 22 private contractors for the provision of the LES in 25 locations and with 44 contractors for the provision of jobs clubs in four locations.  The importance my Department places on the role of LES and jobs clubs is reflected in the work undertaken to develop and enhance the services through contracts that were entered into for 2017.  Jobs clubs are intended for unemployed jobseekers that are identified as job ready. All participants on the formal workshops and CV preparation must be referred by the Department or LES. The increased capacity provided through Intreo and JobPath and the reduction of the live register means the LES can now focus on offering an enhanced service to jobseekers. In line with best practice, and OECD benchmarks, smaller caseloads are key to the provision of the type of one-to-one intensive support and assistance that jobseekers benefit the most from, particularly the long-term unemployed.  The funding and total value of these contracts for the provision of the services has been continually maintained over the years, both through periods of economic downturn and in more recent years during a period where we have seen a welcome reduction in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, from a peak of 15.2% to 6.0%.The LES and jobs clubs contracts are for a maximum of one year, January to December inclusive, and I can now advise the Deputy that we are committed to the provision of those services. The contract bid process for 2018 is underway and it is anticipated that there will be no changes, apart from the enhanced services. The volume of money and the number of people providing the service will be no different than heretofore. 
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister for that assurance. She will be aware that the local employment service deals with people other than those on the live register. It deals with walk-in clients and people who are genuinely seeking employment but who are not on the live register, for whatever reason. The Minister will agree that it is important to provide a public employment service for everybody seeking employment, irrespective of whether they are on the live register. Will the Minister comment on the status of the Indecon report on the local employment service? Has she received the report and when is it proposed to publish it?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I have had the pleasure of meeting organisers and participants from two JobsPlus and jobs clubs. I did this just to be nosey and see exactly what was happening first hand.The reception I got from those in receipt of the services was exceptionally good. By their own accounts, the services are exceptionally valuable. There is real value in the service. I want to confirm to the Deputy and the House that I and the Department recognise that and there is no change to those services. I can confirm that the total contract value last year was just over €20 million for the LES and just over €6 million for jobs clubs, and I do not expect there to be any change next year. While there may be a reduction in the numbers of participants in the centres, we can have more bang for our buck in terms of giving an enhanced service to those availing of it. I have not received the INDECON report on the LES and I will inquire today as to when it will be ready. As soon as I know, I will revert to the Deputy directly or indirectly.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	My understanding is that one of the criteria for jobs clubs or the LES is to place 30% of participants in full-time jobs. Would the Minister agree that, in view of the drop in unemployment and the fact that the LES generally deals with people at the furthest distance from the labour market who, for one reason or another, find it very difficult to get long-term employment, that this is rather onerous and should be changed to include people placed in part-time jobs? Many people will initially get part-time employment.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I know why the Deputy is saying that, but the answer is "No" because we will not reduce our ambition to provide people with assistance in getting full-time jobs. The 30% figure is a target. It is not set in stone. If a service reaches 28.5% we will not cut the legs off it. The LES and every single jobs club does extremely valuable work. In some cases, services have been reconfigured or clubs have been merged because of a reduction in numbers, but not because there has been a reduction in the value of the money, commitment or services provided by the contract and Department. It is simply about reorganisation. There is no club which does not have the ability to come and make a case if it does not reach the minimum target in terms of why, where, when and what it will do to make sure it meets it next year. It is not about reducing standards. We are committed to working together to make sure that we address clubs where there are particular difficulties. That does not really happen because the commitment and ambition of the LES and all jobs clubs are to help people who are jobs ready to match the skills they have with the jobs which are available. The system is working and some LES centres have a jobs finding rate far in excess of 30%. The Deputy may know of one particular case. We are always willing to talk if changes are required. It would be silly for us to make a change to the ambition of what was set down.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	I want to ask the Minister about the level of engagement expected by her Department for retained firefighters and job activation, in particular JobPath.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	There are retained firefighters in my neck of the woods, which is not usual for people who live in cities. I am well aware that retained firefighters provide services which are vital to the communities they serve. They are very well respected. We may engage in a cat-and-mouse exchange. I am not aware of any specific difficulties with retained firefighters with regard to INTREO or JobPath. Retained firefighters who are otherwise unemployed are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of the days that they are engaged in firefighting and-or training, subject to the usual qualification conditions pertaining to means or social insurance contributions. They are also required to satisfy the statutory conditions to receive jobseeker's payments of being available for the days they are not training or on call and genuinely seeking full-time work. Taking into account the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 included amendments to jobseeker's benefit and allowance which put the treatment of retained firefighters on a legislative basis. We did not make individual exceptions for them; the rules are now on a statutory footing. The amendments were introduced with particular regard to the vital service provided by these men and women, in particular in rural communities where, as I said, fire safety is exclusively provided by retained firefighters. The legislation now provides that when a retained firefighter is on call, this does not result in the disallowance of a jobseeker's payment on the grounds of being available for work because he or she is available. However, all retained firefighters in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with the Department's various activation units, including those delivered by the Deputy's favourite organisation, JobPath. During the course of the engagement between the case officer and the jobseeker, all possible pro-employment incentives are explored and discussed with jobseekers. Retained firefighters referred to activation services have every opportunity during the course of those meetings with their personal advisor to schedule around their firefighting, training and on-call duties. I can guarantee that the case officer should be as flexible as he or she possibly can and need to be in regard to dealing retained firefighters. Activation is intended to be a positive experience. If the Deputy is aware of any difficulties I would be very grateful if he told me about them.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Minister for the response. A recent reply from the Department to a parliamentary question stated that 482 retained firefighters are in receipt of jobseeker's payment. That shows the difficulty retained firefighters have in holding down full-time employment due to the nature of their work. The legislation introduced to reflect that in 2013 states that the legislation and associated regulations allow retained firefighters a reasonable and fair level of access to jobseeker's schemes, given the unique circumstances of the service they provide to communities. I have met retained firefighters in rural areas who do not have access to employment or flexible employers, given the nature of their retained services. Retained firefighters in many areas are on call 24-7. They are engaging with case officers in INTREO offices and are being put under severe pressure to find employment, no matter where it is, or be moved to JobPath which, they are told, will get them jobs.  Has provision been made for the special circumstance of retained firefighters by INTREO offices and JobPath? Are their unique employment circumstances taken into account?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	As I said in my initial reply, the legislation was changed in 2013 to reflect the special status of firefighters, which carries through to all of the activation measures in which we engage. As I said, they are in the main a positive experience which result in people who are unemployed getting work or people who are under-employed getting more work. Those working in any of our activation processes in INTREO, JobPath, jobs clubs, JobsPlus or any other organisation which fulfils contracts for the Department are well aware of the conditions under which firefighters have to work and work around them. I am not sure whether the Deputy is suggesting that we should treat retained firefighting as a full-time job and not help firefighters to get more employment. Is he suggesting that they are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week and, therefore, are not available? If either of those things happen, retained firefighters do not satisfy the conditions of jobseeker's benefit or allowance. A large number of the 482 retained firefighters to whom the Deputy referred rely on jobseeker's benefit or allowance. Therefore, they need to satisfy the conditions in order to avail of those payments, exclusive of any activation programmes.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I thank the Minister. I do not think she is getting the point I am making. The legislation introduced in 2013 dealt with the specific circumstances around the employment of retained firefighters who are on call 24-7. That does not mean that they are dealing with emergency situations every day of the week. They may get a call once a week or, in certain circumstances, every six months. They do not know what will happen from one week to the next.I will cite a specific local case, which is replicated across the State. I met retained firefighters in Dunlavin in my constituency of Wicklow, half of whom are in receipt of a jobseeker's payment. They have been dealing with case officers for up to 12 months. As they reach the end of the process, they are coming under pressure from case officers to take a job anywhere or they will be moved on to JobPath and that service will find a job for them. No consideration is given to the nature of their employment as retained firefighters and the requirement to be able to reach their local fire station from home or work within five minutes of a call-out.

#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	It is not possible for retained firefighters in Dunlavin to take a job in Carlow or Baltinglass because they must work in the local area. There are no places available on the community employment scheme in the town. Two retained firefighters are on the scheme and there are no other employment opportunities locally. They are being forced to take employment in neighbouring counties, which places their jobs in the retained fire service in jeopardy.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	Deputies must show regard for the clock. Business started late because we did not have a quorum. We are running late.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I am always being given out to for speaking too quickly. I decided to speak slowly today but perhaps I will speed up. The issue the Deputy raises is genuinely not in contention. We return to the fact that one of the conditions of jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance is that the recipient must be available for work. A special condition was inserted in the legislation to recognise that retained firefighters are not always available for work. In all of the activation programmes, whether community employment, the Tús scheme, the rural social scheme, jobs clubs, JobPath or the Intreo services, there is a recognition that retained firefighters are not available for work on the days they are on call or in training. However, we cannot discount the days on which they are not on call or in training because these days are the reason they qualify for jobseeker's payment in the first instance. The ambition of all those in receipt of a jobseeker's payment is to secure a job. That is not my ambition but their ambition, which is the reason the support schemes and payments were set up as they were. The purpose of the payment is to keep recipients ticking over, albeit at a basic level, until they find a job. The Deputy appears to suggest we should leave retained firefighters alone. I am not sure that would be the right thing to do.

I assure Deputies O'Dea, Coppinger and Connolly that we will aggregate the times to allow each of them sufficient time to contribute. The only difference in the case of a group is that the Deputy who tables the first question is given an opportunity to introduce the question for 30 seconds.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I raise this question because, as the Minister will be aware, one of the criteria for receiving a lone parent allowance is that the lone parent can receive maintenance from his or her former partner. My understanding is that it is the policy of the Department that people will not be required to pursue an ex-partner who has been violent or abusive. Unfortunately, while this may be the general policy, the Department does not appear to have protocols or procedures in place to ensure this occurs. I have dealt with cases of people being told in fairly blunt terms to seek maintenance against a violent or abusive former partner or else lose the lone parent allowance. What is the up-to-date position in this regard?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I hope the Deputies do not mind discussing the three questions together.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	Members have no choice in the matter. It is the Minister's prerogative to make decisions on grouping questions. Every Deputy will receive the full allocated time.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 to 34, inclusive, together. I welcome some of the people present in the Visitors Gallery. It is nice to see them again. I will provide a little background before informing the House of developments in the past week. The Family Law Acts, which are under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, place a legal obligation on parents to maintain and mind their children. This is a civil law matter. In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply to the mother and father. Relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either through family mediation, the Legal Aid Board or the courts, all of which are under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality. It is a condition of the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment schemes that lone parents must make efforts to seek maintenance from the other parent, for example, evidence of a private maintenance arrangement or court proceedings, a court summons or a mediation process. The condition to make efforts to seek maintenance is regarded as having been satisfied once appropriate efforts are made, even if they do not result in a maintenance payment being made. My Department takes the issue of domestic violence very seriously. We are in the middle of Women's Aid's "16 Days" campaign which I fully support every year. I also recognise that the maintenance recovery unit does a worthwhile job in assisting people where its assistance is required. The guidelines in place in my Department with regard to seeking maintenance are clear in respect of circumstances involving domestic abuse or violence. Claims should be processed without delay to the individual who presents and without the lone parent who has the child ever having to contact the former partner. Historically, for reasons of data protection, when a person presented to a local social welfare office indicating that he or she was in a difficult or vulnerable position, a flag was not placed on his or her electronic record because the Department did not want him or her to be known for that particular flag. In the past week, a case was brought to my attention by a very brave young woman. Last Friday, I met the young woman in question and her beautiful little boy and we had a long conversation about what had happened to her in order that I could learn about what broke down in the delivery of the Department's services. We have learned a couple of things, the first of which is that there is a disconnect between local offices and the maintenance recovery section caused by the lack of a flag on the electronic record. My information technology staff and I have a window at the beginning of December to change the position. Once this has been done, it will be possible to tick a box indicating that a letter should not be sent out. No reason or explanation will be given for flagging the person's record. However, when the maintenance recovery section receives the file the ticked box will indicate that a letter will not be required.  I also had the privilege of meeting representatives of Women's Aid in the Department yesterday. I rang the organisation last week requesting a meeting and we had the launch of the "16 Days" campaign on Friday. We gave Women's Aid copies of all the letters and correspondence the Department sends to lone parents, with a view to having these documents adapted and changed through the lens of someone who is in a vulnerable position and to ensure that no one, even through human error, will receive a letter that causes pain or distress, such as occurred last week. Women's Aid agreed to come back to me within a week with suggestions on the wording of the correspondence. We also agreed that Women's Aid will develop an accredited training course for the Department to be delivered to all front-line staff who may deal with a person who is in a vulnerable or precarious position. The training course will be delivered by Women's Aid in conjunction with the Department's staff development and training unit. We agreed at our meeting yesterday to set this process in train and it will be completed in the coming weeks. On the back of yesterday's meeting, the Department also established a working group to recommence work it was doing on maintenance recovery last year. This work was interrupted by the delivery of the Indecon report on the one-parent family payment because the same group of officials was doing the work in both areas. We are now back where we were seven months ago in terms of reflecting on the collection of maintenance payments, the reasons for current practice in this area and how best to move forward with the process, where necessary. I will seek suggestions on this issue in future. Some Deputies and Senators have already contacted me with a view to making an input in the process. I will be grateful to receive helpful submissions on the issue. 
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I welcome the Minister's initiative in this regard and wish it every success. She is correct that there is a disconnect within the Department, centrally and locally. I have come across cases where barring or protection orders had been submitted, yet a local social welfare officer insisted on the person in question pursuing a maintenance claim. On the liable relative provisions, traditionally it has been possible for a person in receipt of one-parent's payment, in conjunction with the Department, to get the recovery maintenance unit involved in collecting money from a former partner. This no longer occurs when the youngest child reaches his or her seventh birthday and the lone parent transfers to the jobseeker's transition payment. Why are the services of the maintenance recovery unit not available to people who have been in receipt of one-parent's allowance who transition to the jobseeker's transition payment because the youngest child reaches the age of seven?

#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	This issue arose and was well publicised because when "Kate" - not her real name - applied for the one-parent family payment, she was told to make reasonable efforts to contact her former partner. When she produced a safety order, the staff member said such orders were quite easy to obtain and intimated that some people got them to avoid having maintenance payments factored in. That is completely and utterly unacceptable. This issue has been highlighted and the Minister has met the person involved, as well as a number of organisations. However, we need a need a clear protocol to be issued in order that a victim simply stating he or she is a victim will be enough. I press the Minister to state this is the instruction that is being issued to all local offices because many victims do not obtain safety orders. It is estimated that 79% of victims do not obtain them. We know that many victims experience financial, emotional and other forms of abuse and having to make any contact with an abusive partner can get them into so much difficulty. We should not be re-victimising them in this way. We should also recognise that when women become pregnant, it can, unfortunately, be a red flag for further abuse. Often fathers seek to control women. A study carried out in the Rotunda Hospital showed that one in eight women attending had experienced some form of abuse during pregnancy. Much of this emanates from the Government's welfare cheats campaign. I know that the Minister is now taking action to resolve the issue, but a philosophy is spreading within the Department that staff check, question and do everything that it is possible to do.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I welcome the progress the Minister is making. However, I deplore the fact that it took a courageous mother, a report in The Irish
Times, coverage in various media, particularly an interview with the Minister on the Seán O'Rourke radio programme, and questions in the Dáil to bring about change. That is most unfortunate, given the appalling statistics. Have officials in the Department read the report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection that was produced in June? It mentions specific problems experienced by lone parents and other mothers in the context of domestic violence. It also references the need for a national maintenance agency. That is one element of my question, namely, what is the situation with regard to the establishment of such an agency? The second part of my question relates to training. The Minister has confirmed that training will be provided for staff. I hope such training will be ongoing and would like more details on it. I welcome the people in the Visitors Gallery whom I do not want to identify. I praise their courage. We have raised this issue repeatedly in the context of the SAVI report and so on. If we extrapolate from the 2016 figures, we find that 4,831 requests for refuge were refused because there was no space available. That represents approximately 14 unmet requests every single day, yet we have the Department writing letters of this nature. Will the Minister confirm that such letters will never be written and sent ever again? As regards the grey area, is the Minister telling us that only those who produce orders will receive payments? Will she clarify the matter? In summary, I have asked about the establishment of a national maintenance agency, the nature of the ongoing training provided and what must be produced by claimants.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	In response to Deputy Willie O'Dea's question, I do not know why the maintenance recovery division does not operate after a child reaches the age of seven years, but I will find out. The Deputy is aware that under section 12 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, we have the ability, through the maintenance recovery division, to go after somebody for maintenance. To be honest, I question why we even do that. The whole idea in having a Department of Social Protection is to protect people who are vulnerable. There may be a requirement to establish a national maintenance agency, but, to be honest, I do not see where it would fall into the space of my Department. The issue will form part of the exploratory work we will do in the coming weeks. In response to Deputy Ruth Coppinger, I have two comments to make, one of which will go some way towards also answering Deputy Catherine Connolly's question. There are clear protocols in place for any woman - in the main, we are talking about women, although, obviously, there are some exceptions - who comes to our office looking to receive the one-parent family payment and who is in a vulnerable position. My job is to lead a Department that believes women, not one that makes a woman to prove something or get a piece of paper but one that listens to her story and believes her. If there is any woman who is finding it difficult, it may be because front-line staff have not received the correct training, but that issue is being resolved. I assure Deputy Catherine Connolly that it will not be me who will devise the training course but Women's Aid which has specific knowledge and experience. Its trainers, with their specific knowledge, training and experience, will train our staff.  To answer the Deputy's question about the letter, because of the way the law stands, parents have a responsibility to their children. The State does not step in to take over that responsibility where parents have the means and ability to be responsible for their children. Therefore, letters will be sent. However, I suggest such letters be sent to the neglectful parent rather than the parent who is raising the children. Again, that issue will form part of the discussions we will have in the coming weeks.  There are clear protocols in place. We do believe women and I will not tolerate a situation where we do not. No woman who expresses the view that she is in a vulnerable position will receive a letter. However, there are other letters that are sent by the maintenance recovery division and we need to have a wider conversation about whether a national agency is required to provide for maintenance recovery and, more importantly, whether my Department should have any hand, act or part in that process. That is the course of the conversation that should have in the coming weeks. On the actions I have taken, the letters will be modified. I hope the language used in them will never cause the distress caused in the last week. The IT systems will change. When a person presents at a local office to relate his or her experience, without a shadow of a doubt, he or she will be believed, and the IT systems will reflect this in order that no person in a vulnerable position will receive one of the Department's letters. We will also pursue the provision of training for all of our staff who, in the main, provide an empathetic and human response and try to provide people with assistance during periods of their lives in which they cannot afford to mind themselves.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	Do I take it from the Minister's reply that if people claim that theirs is a violent or abusive relationship, their word will be taken and that they will not have to produce any documentation, Garda reports and so on? May I take it that will be the position?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	Absolutely.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	As regards liable relatives in the context of receipt of the jobseeker's transition payment, it does not apply to lone parents in receipt of the payment because the legislation was never changed when the age of the youngest child to qualify for the lone-parent family payment was reduced to seven years. Does the Minister have plans to amend the legislation to provide for this? It makes no sense that the maintenance recovery division can operate up to a child's seventh birthday but once the child reaches the age of seven years, the parent is more or less on his or her own. At the same time, the ex-partner will have received a letter from the Department stating he or she is no longer liable to pay maintenance. By any standard, that is undesirable. I argue having a national maintenance agency is very relevant in the context of the Department of Social Protection. We are talking about a mechanism to compel people to discharge their responsibilities, which responsibilities have resulted in the Department paying out money. We are asking the people in question to make a contribution.If there is an effective national agency recovering money from those people, the Department will have more money to redirect to other areas, such as that relating to disabilities.

Obviously, not everyone would be in a position to do that. I also acknowledge SPARK, which provided assistance. How many other women have received these letters or verbal messages from local Department offices? The most dangerous time for any victim of abuse is when she leaves a relationship, yet society questions why women stay in abusive relationships. Ending a relationship and severing contact are extremely dangerous steps for women who are victims of domestic violence to take. We need an education campaign on this matter across society. It should not only be addressed in the Department. I acknowledge that this is not strictly under the remit of the Minister's Department but women will come into contact with the Department. Some 80% of people who are abused are abused by partners or ex-partners according to Women's Aid. At the extreme end, 55% of murders of women are by partners or ex-partners. One in three women will experience psychological abuse in her lifetime. We are seeing an increase in stalking by means of social media. There are many ways in which an abuser may maintain control over a victim of domestic violence. Unless we fund refuges, it will be extremely difficult for women to leave abusive situations. Rape crisis centres have had their funding cut by 30%.

Unfortunately, there is not a clear practice and that is why we are here. I would be more reassured if the Minister told me there is now a clear practice, that she has given direction in this regard and that letters of the kind in question will never be sent out again. The letter we referred to, brought to our attention and the attention of SPARK by the courageous woman involved, was not an aberration; it was a reflection of the practice in the Minister's Department in respect of people, mostly women, in receipt of the lone parent's allowance and also suffering as a result of domestic violence. The extent of domestic violence is absolutely extraordinary. Some 12,500 people per year are affected. The Safe Ireland document is worth reading. Deputy Coppinger and I have mentioned this, as have other female Deputies. Perhaps when the male Deputies come on board, we will have some change in the Dáil. I did not doubt the training being provided by Women's Aid or Safe Ireland. I asked the Minister about the types of procedures that are in place for ongoing training. An understanding of domestic violence is extraordinarily complex to get across. It seems simple but it is a matter of bringing it home to staff. On top of that, 79% of those affected simply do not report domestic violence. Let me return to the question by my colleague from Fianna Fáil. Could the Minister please confirm, given the extraordinary extent of domestic violence, that one does not need a protection order, barring order or safety order in one's hand to receive the payment? Could the Minister confirm that training is ongoing?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I will work backwards because I am not sure whether Deputy Connolly heard me the first time. I will be very clear and make my remark again.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I heard but I might not have understood.

If a woman - we are talking about women in the main - or a man who is suffering at the hands of an abusive partner presents at a local office and explains his or her story, that is the end of the road. There is no need for a piece of paper or a barring order. I must state very clearly, as I did a few minutes ago, that we believe women. The inference is otherwise, that somebody might make up a story of domestic violence. That is so distasteful it is not funny. Very clearly, we believe women. If a woman or a man arrives at a local office anywhere in the country and tells the staff about a vulnerable situation, that will be the end of his or her story. I have already explained to the Deputy that I cannot guarantee that people will not get letters because it is a function of the maintenance recovery department.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	I was referring to the nature of the letters.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	It is because of the nature of the letters that I enlisted Women's Aid. When I read the letter, it actually seemed relatively benign. I have never been in a vulnerable position, thankfully, and that is why I called Ursula Regan from Women's Aid and asked her to come in with Margaret Martin to go through the letters and look at them from their perspective as people who deal with vulnerable women and men on a daily basis. They will write the letters; I am not going to write them. This will form part of what will be provided as part of a protocol in our office. As I have told the Deputy, we are going to change the IT system so that, irrespective of the wording of the letters, anybody vulnerable who has ever presented with a case will never get a letter. Right now, however, there is a requirement to receive a one-parent family payment to pursue the parent who is not contributing to the maintenance of his or her child. I actually had to question why we are using the person who is maintaining the child as the conduit to chase the person who is not. I say this for all the reasons Deputy Coppinger raised, not least of which is that the undesirable arrangement referred to puts women back in the position of being under the control and power of men. Although most men are not abusive, why should a woman be under the control or power of a man because she has chosen to leave him and rear her children on her own? I have so many questions on the maintenance recovery section of my Department but, as I said, we will pursue in the coming weeks the best way to go forward with regard to maintenance recovery. Deputy O'Dea is correct that it is absolutely ludicrous that we should be sending a letter to a man to say that just because Mary is seven and a half now, he has no more responsibility for her. That does not reflect the way I was reared, nor the way most people were reared. If one has a child, one has a responsibility to that child until he or she is 18 and, as most parents will tell one, long after that. That should be true for every single person who has a child, irrespective of whether he or she is living in the house with the child. The obligation we have towards our children stands for many years after the age of seven. To be honest with the Deputy, I was made aware of the letter only yesterday. The situation is ludicrous and that is why we need to reflect on the role our Department should play, if any, in maintenance recovery in respect of welfare payments to children by the parents who are no longer in their lives on a daily basis.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	What are the Minister's plans to address the unemployment black spots in County Wexford? Could she make a statement on the matter?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The official measure of unemployment is sourced from the quarterly national household survey, QNHS. The most recent data show that the unemployment rate fell from a peak of 15% in 2012 to just over 6% in mid-2017. The number at work has increased from just over 1.8 million in quarter 2 of 2012 to over 2 million in quarter 2 of 2017. That is an increase of just under 230,000 people with new jobs. Within the south-east region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from a staggering 19% to 8.1% over the same period, and the number in employment has increased by 29,000 to 214,900. While the data from the QNHS are not available at county level, trends in the live register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment. Overall, the live register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in five years, close to the reduction of 44% nationally. In the year to October 2017, the live register number in Wexford has fallen by 1,741 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with the national trend. The Government's primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 has been twofold. First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, the objective is to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs. The policy now includes a specific regional action plan for jobs for the south east that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the area over the past two years. Second, through Pathways to Work, we ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the live register. Under this policy, the employment service and activation supports provided by my Department are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford. For example, case officers in Wexford are currently working with over 1,400 people in identifying suitable employment and training opportunities. Almost 3,000 referrals to training and educational opportunities took place in 2016. A total of 1,165 of those training opportunities have been made to date in 2017, an increase of over 33% on the same period in 2016. I acknowledge the Deputy is concerned about his region but the policies we have put in place, both through activation and the Action Plan for Jobs, are working. We will continue to give extra support to Wexford until its figures are in line with the national trend.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	My question concerns the unemployment black spots, particularly those in County Wexford as outlined in the recently released CSO figures. The south east in general and parts of Wexford in particular continue to suffer unnecessarily from high unemployment. I say unnecessarily because there is a huge untapped potential in terms of the economy in County Wexford, particularly in light of its proximity to Dublin and Europe. I am particularly concerned that, in the broader statistics of decreasing unemployment, local areas with persistent unemployment will be lost in the statistics and forgotten. It will take targeted measures to address the high levels of unemployment in certain parts of Wexford. I am especially concerned about unemployed people under the age of 25 and those over the age of 55. Will the Minister outline the specific programmes to target youth unemployment and unemployment among those aged over 55, particularly in circumstances where individuals have been unemployed long term?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	It is astounding that the number of unemployed people in the south east rose from 181,300 in 2012 to 214,900 in 2017, an increase of 15.5%, whereas nationally unemployment rose by only 11.5% in the same period. Specific care, attention and extra resources are being given to the south east. The unemployment rate in the south east is still relatively high at 8.1% given that the national average is 6%. In terms of unemployment black spots identified in the census, it is important to recognise that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's services through the Intreo offices, jobs clubs, JobPath and other activation measures are focused on unemployed individuals as opposed to specific areas. This means that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated get the most supports. That is currently what happens and it will continue to happen in the south east. We will work to ensure that the success realised in recent years in terms of the improvement of employment levels in Deputy Browne's area will continue. We will keep working until everybody who wants a job can get a job.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I acknowledge that there has been employment growth but the south east, particularly Wexford, still lags behind the rest of the country. High rates of unemployment continue to be a feature in parts of County Wexford. In the context of activation programmes and trying to get individuals back into the workforce, I am concerned that some of the activity in this regard is not being pursued in an intelligent manner. I am aware of many people both under the age of 25 and over the age of 55 who suffer from obvious mental health problems. They have difficulties remaining in mainstream employment but they are being taken off community employment, CE, schemes in circumstances where, for example, they are contributing to local society. I refer to meals on wheels schemes, village renewal schemes and work in community centres. Those people are being forced into training and start-your-own-business schemes for which they are plainly not suitable when it would be good for their mental health and for the community if they were allowed to remain on the schemes to which I refer. The concerns of individuals who are experiencing difficulties should be addressed.

I wish to correct the record. Nobody is taken off a CE scheme or a Tús scheme. Conditions attach to those activation programmes. For Tús, there is a one-year condition attaching.

Terms and conditions attach to every activation scheme. The current terms and conditions with CE schemes are two years and three years, with an extension to seven years in a person's total working lifespan. Nobody is taken off a CE scheme. People come to the end of their term and have to go to other activation programmes, as is the norm. The CE schemes are under review in the context of changing those terms and conditions to reflect some of the things Deputy Browne suggested. He should please not misrepresent the schemes that were established by his party some years ago.

#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	I wish to ask the Minister what actions are being taken by her Department to tackle bogus self-employment, which is rife within the construction and media sectors. The result is a loss of PRSI contributions and a loss to the Exchequer in general. There are also major implications for workers' rights and entitlements.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	Deputy Brady is aware that this is a particular bugbear of mine. Bogus self-employment arises when an employer wrongly treats a worker as an independent contractor in order to avoid paying tax and social insurance contributions. There are no official data on the extent of bogus self-employment but I wish there was. It is not clear whether the problem is growing but, anecdotally, we are all aware that the norms within working environments are changing. The recent data from the quarterly national household survey records 312,000 individuals as self-employed in 2017, which accounts for 15% of the overall number of people in employment. The survey does not show any significant increase in the numbers claiming to be self-employed, nor does it show any significant disparity between Ireland and other European countries. It is a case that we all have a problem and that we have had it for a long time and have just not addressed it. I hope the House collectively wants to fix that. Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses as part of the ongoing compliance operations. Inspections are conducted jointly between the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission. Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, the matter is pursued. Officials also investigate specific claims brought to the Department's attention by either individuals or organisations. The relevant section in the Department is the scope insurability section. The section determines the employment status of individuals at their request or on the request of a company. Where a misclassification of a worker as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class are determined and social insurance arrears are collected. Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences concerning employment contributions. On conviction, fines and-or imprisonment can ultimately imposed.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
Any worker who has concerns about his or her employment and PRSI status should contact my Department and the matter will be investigated. The classification of a worker for PRSI purposes is increasingly complicated by what is termed "disguised employment". The latter involves intermediary employment structures and certain self-employment arrangements. My Department is concerned that such mechanisms are being used to reduce the amount of PRSI and tax being paid, with a subsequent loss to the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund. An interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners has completed a report on this issue. The Minister for Finance and I are considering the report with a view to its publication in the near future.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The Minister indicated that 312,000 people are registered as self-employed within the State. There is not just anecdotal evidence of bogus self-employment in the construction sector, it is also a feature in the information technology, IT, and media sectors. In January 2016, the then Ministers for Social Protection and Finance launched a joint consultation on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements. A public consultation process was initiated and a total of 23 submissions were made to it. Last month, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister and was informed that the two Departments are working on the issue and that the submissions are still being assessed. The public consultation took place 20 months ago. We need action. What is the status of the report and when will it be published? The issue is very serious. I will refer to other areas in a moment but I would first like the Minister to respond.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	We are not still considering the 23 submissions. They have been considered. My real concern is that there were only 23. The report is being considered by me and the Minister for Finance. I expect to be able to publish it in the next couple of weeks with a view to determining actions we will take at the beginning of next year to address the issue. My concerns are twofold. It is not my job to collect social insurance contributions but it is my job to spend the money from those contributions.If I had what we all perceive to be the shortfall of employers' PRSI to spend, we could have a really different conversation in this House on how to spend it. Equally important to me are employment rights, which is my responsibility, for those people who find themselves in positions where they are forced into self-employment as opposed to real employment. I am determined to fix that early next year. If there is a bonus of getting a couple of million euro or a couple of hundred million euro extra in social insurance contributions, I will enjoy having that conversation at the committee on how to spend it.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	A couple of weeks ago before the social protection committee, the Minister said she hoped to bring this report to a sub-committee of the Cabinet. Has that happened? We know there is much money lost to Revenue and through potential social insurance contributions. The overall loss to the Exchequer could be €80 million. The Minister also touched on inspections being carried out by the Department but I ask for specifics on that. I am not sure what exactly officials or inspectors from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are looking for when they go into check this type of employment, whether it is on a building site or elsewhere. Perhaps in the first instance they check if somebody is in receipt of a jobseeker's payment and working as well. That does not cut to the chase. There are people who are forced into self-employment who are losing out on their entitlements as employees. For example, they should be entitled to sick pay, holiday pay and all the other entitlements that go along with that. It is a serious problem not just in the construction industry, as I stated, but in other areas. How many of these inspections have been carried out and in what type of employment? Have they just targeted the construction industry? Have they gone to places such as RTÉ, for example, and what exactly are the inspectors looking for? I would like more specifics on the inspectors.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The Deputy might be confused as there are many different inspectors and sections in our Department. The inspectors who look after this have nothing to do with trying to figure out if a person is on a jobseeker's payment. That is somebody else's job. The inspectors involved with assessing insurability contributions go into a job and see that a person is in class S when he or she should be in class K. They will reflect that and get it changed. It is about working with both the employer and employee to ensure the right classification of a social insurance contribution is made on behalf of employees, and if it is not, to back-track it and ensure dues to the State are paid. There is also the scope section within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Any of the people suggested by the Deputy who may find themselves in positions where they know they are not really self-employed can make a complaint or inquiry to the Department any day of the week and we will follow it up. The problem is these people do not do so. They do it in small numbers. My belief is many of the 312,000 people perhaps do not know about the scope unit and we will address that in the new year. I am not sure I said the report was going to a sub-committee of the Cabinet. That might have been the other report on the pensions anomaly. I have so many reports coming out of my ears at this stage, it is not funny. This report is not going to a sub-committee of the Cabinet but it is going to Cabinet in the next couple of weeks. The only reason I am holding off is because I am not prepared to send a report to the Cabinet without clear, precise, specific recommendations as to how we can address the matter. That is what I am considering now with the Minister for Finance.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I sympathise with the Minister as, like her, I am following so many pensions investigations and I am not sure what she thinks this question is about or even what my office thinks it is about. In my head, it covers two elements. The first is a progress report on the investigation sought by the Minister from the Pensions Authority into the Aer Lingus second supplementary pension scheme. It could also potentially address the review of the annuity matter we discussed in a Topical Issue debate some time ago.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	Scheme trustees have duties and responsibilities under trust law, under other relevant legislation and under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended. The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules. I had previously confirmed that the matter relating to the scheme we spoke about recently has been raised by my Department with the Pensions Authority. It has informed me that an examination of the scheme is being actively pursued. The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a breach of any legal obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach is found. I am not in a position to tell the Deputy when this will happen, and I know that is probably frustrating. In fairness, the authority is doing a good deed for us and it is not within my gift to tell it to hurry up. The authority will revert as quickly as it can. There is another matter that is not reflected in the question. I know the Deputy has some amendments to the Social Welfare Bill and I spoke to her colleague yesterday evening when we were debating the Bill. The amendments will be ruled out of order in regard to this Bill. They are not suitable for this Bill and they would be more appropriate for the social welfare and pensions Bill. I ask her to put down the amendments again to that Bill.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I thank the Minister. I suppose the reassurance that staff and members of the scheme want is to know the investigation is still being actively pursued. There is a worry about a time delay. I remind the House we were dealing with a case where a second supplementary pension scheme had €100 million in it was sitting there for two years, belonging to people who had retired in the meantime and other people who had a right to access those benefits. It was being bled by management charges, payments and so on, basically haemorrhaging value. The big concern for staff is that after pushing for assets to be distributed for almost two years, finally getting the most appalling distribution mechanism that anyone could have thought and putting a block on that, the danger is that the investigation may lead to moneys not being distributed for a further period. I ask that we keep the pressure on. It is probably the reason for this question. There are many people with entitlements who have been treated quite shabbily.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	We requested the investigation at the Deputy's request. I am very happy to have done that. We saw this parliamentary question come in this week and we contacted the authority again, which gave us the assurance that the investigation is being actively pursued. I hope the Deputy appreciates that I am not in a position to give her a date on it, but we will keep in constant contact to ensure the matter is finalised.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I thank the Minister. There are broader matters linking to this scheme, the wind-up and annuities being purchased for pensioners. This morning, a joint life annuity allowing for 1.5% inflation per year would cost €37 for every €1 of pension. We discussed last week the need to seriously address that area. There is some form of consultation that the Department will initiate in that respect. It is incredibly urgent, given the number of pensioners who need to access funds, who are essentially being bled dry and whose schemes are losing money because of what needs to go to annuity purchases. The only winners in that are the big companies and it is to the detriment of others with the reduction of benefits in the scheme. We need an urgent review of all aspects of the area. Many of the issues with this scheme are linked to the so-called minimum funding standard and liabilities being calculated on annuity prices. This is quite urgent and we must progress the matter.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The Deputy knows I agree with her. The Pensions Act 1990 is the legislation that must be amended but the Taxes Consolidation Act allows flexible options. That is the area where what we are discussing must be reflected. I have written to the Minister to ask him to do so. When we launch the public consultation on pension reform, it will be the time to sit down and determine exactly what is in the best interests of the people the Deputy and I represent so we can make the changes reflecting what they want and need.

I am concerned that people meeting those qualifying criteria during the summer months, when the fuel allowance is not available, will lose their entitlements. We are trying to establish how the Minister intends to identify them and ensure they get their payments. I am speaking particularly about people whose incomes fall below the threshold of the fuel allowance.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	If I am to be really honest, I was not 100% sure about what the Deputy was asking but now I am sure. Is the Deputy's concern that when the fuel allowance is not being paid, people will not get their telephone allowance?

We cross-reference anybody who is in receipt of the fuel allowance or other payments and he or she is entitled to receive the telephone allowance which will be paid on a weekly basis. The two conditions will determine who will receive it, but once it is decided that a person is to receive the allowance, he or she will receive it every week. I hope that makes sense.
#AindriasMoynihan	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-party	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-dob	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	The group of people who become eligible during the summer months to receive the fuel allowance will not be able to apply for it until September. How are persons whose incomes fall during the months of April, May, June, July, August and September to be identified? Will they have an opportunity to make an application for the fuel allowance to ensure their telephone allowance will be payable during the summer months, or will they be excluded until September when they can apply for the fuel allowance? I want to ensure those who meet the eligibility criteria will receive the relevant payment.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I understand totally what the Deputy is saying, but I do not know the answer. I know that people can only apply for the fuel allowance on a bi-annual basis. If in May a person thinks he or she might qualify for the fuel allowance, he or she should be able to apply for it at that stage. I will reflect on the matter and revert to the Deputy. In order to receive the telephone allowance one has to qualify for a social welfare payment and the fuel allowance, but it is not right that the opportunity to apply for the fuel allowance only arises twice a year. That is not what we were trying to do in the budget. I thank the Deputy for his question.

People who want to participate in a community employment scheme or various other schemes believe they are trapped in JobPath and Turas Nua. They are looking for flexibility in order that they can switch back and forth between the most appropriate schemes to allow them to up-skill and move on in their careers and lives without being trapped in Turas Nua.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	All persons in receipt of a jobseeker’s payment are required to be seeking full-time work, a condition which a person must satisfy at all times. Customers referred to JobPath who are also working part time will have all activities, including meetings with their personal adviser, scheduled around their work commitments. The JobPath contractors are required to be flexible in the provision of the service in that respect. For those customers who take up seasonal work when engaged with JobPath, the service will offer in-work support and customers will not be required to attend meetings with their personal adviser until the employment ends. The customer effectively comes off JobPath for the period of their seasonal work and come back onto the scheme when they are finished. In the case of jobseekers already in part-time or seasonal employment, the focus will be on opportunities to increase the level of employment in their current role, or look at possibilities in other areas, including training, which may provide a more sustainable income and for a move away from jobseeker payments.  On the number of clients who have gained employment, it will take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients who have completed their engagement period with the service for complete and robust outcome data to be available. However, the most recent cohort report published on the Department’s website indicates that 19% of jobseekers who engaged with JobPath between July 2015 and March 2016 are now in full-time employment.

This issue has been raised a number of times, including in my office in recent days. There is a constant flow of queries and many Deputies will have had the same experience. If a person has a guarantee of a job or an opportunity to participate in a community employment scheme or avail of various other opportunities and is then pulled towards Turas Nua, he or she feels obliged to take that route. People believe they are losing out on the opportunity to participate in community employment schemes or the opportunity to avail of an internship or participate in the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and that they are being excluded from what would be an opportunity to up-skill in being pulled into a one-size-that-does-not-fit-all scheme such as Turas Nua. The scheme has been in place for a number of years and is due for review. The original contract was for four years. The provision of flexibility to allow people to take the other routes, without having to enter the Turas Nua scheme, as some feel pressured to do, is one of the issues that must be identified.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	There is no competition between activation programmes. Tús, the community employment programme, Seetech and Turas Nua are all providing activation programmes which are slightly different for different people, but there is no competition between the community employment programme and JobPath as activation measures. They are different streams of processes supported by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to try to get people into work.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	That is why we choose very carefully who is sent to JobPath, the commmunity employment programme or Tús. With respect, each of them provides a different level of training or work experience to make sure people are job-ready. JobPath provides participants with a guaranteed service which includes not only one-to-one support and training but also a continual counselling and advice service to make sure they will be matched with the jobs available or that they will be retrained in order that they can make themselves available to fill the jobs available. However, there is no competition across the range of employment schemes. Each has been designed to specifically address a particular section of the market. There have been some complaints in recent months that people are finding it harder to fill CE schemes because people are on another activation measure, but no one has ever told me that there is a problem filling CE schemes because they are on Tús, the rural social scheme, RSS, a partial capacity payment or an invalidity payment. There is no draw here from one section to another. We offer services in this Department which suit the needs of particular people at particular times. JobPath is doing its job particularly admirably, considering that it has a 16% success rate.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 57 together.  In his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, the Taoiseach gave a commitment on Report Stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 in the Dáil that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker’s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment. My officials have recently completed a report on these issues which I am considering in detail. To qualify for jobseeker’s benefit, a person must be unemployed, be available for and genuinely seeking work, have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least four days out of seven every week. The jobseeker’s benefit scheme provides significant support for individuals who can work up to three days a week and receive a jobseeker’s payment. Seasonal work can be full time, part time or casual, depending on the type of work involved. A seasonal worker who is employed on a full-time basis would not be entitled to a jobseeker’s payment while in that seasonal employment. Contributions paid during this time can be used to re-qualify for jobseeker's benefit, subject to scheme conditionality.  My Department operates a fast-tracking system for customers who sign off on their jobseeker’s allowance or jobseeker’s benefit claim to take up work or a training course for a period of up to 12 weeks, which reflects the seasonal nature of the work in some instances.In these cases, the claim is not closed but payment is suspended temporarily for the duration of the work or training course. When the person signs on again after the period of work or training, the claim can be reactivated without delay and payment restored. Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseeker’s benefit, he or she must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions after the last day of payment in order to re-qualify. The 13 contributions needed to re-qualify for jobseeker’s benefit can be paid in respect of full-time employment, seasonal employment, part-time employment or casual employment. If a seasonal or a part-time worker meets this requirement, he or she may re-qualify for jobseeker’s benefit. If a person does not re-qualify for jobseeker’s benefit or has used up his or her entitlement to jobseeker’s benefit, he or she can apply for jobseeker’s allowance. It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that the conditions for receipt of a jobseeker's payment apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	The Minister has told us what the regulations are at the moment but her predecessor and the Taoiseach gave a commitment in this House, to me and Deputy Willie O'Dea, that a report would be prepared within three months. That was 12 months ago. It is very hard to explain this to those on seasonal or part-time work who make a very important contribution to farming, fishing and tourism, and something has to be done about it. The Minister met with a delegation of seasonal and part-time workers during the IFA briefings here in Dublin some months ago so she is familiar with the case. These people play an essential part in the various sectors to which I referred. I am aware of the need to build up contributions for 13 weeks after a claim but these things are not practical for those people and the whole purpose of the report is to allow the Minister to consider introducing new regulations that would be practical. The subsidiary income threshold of €12.70 per day, or €63 per week, is totally unfair and this must be dealt with. I know the Minister is committed to looking at this but there can be no further procrastination. Can she give us a definite date when she will have the report and will make recommendations?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I can give a definite date as to when I had the report as I received it yesterday. I cannot give the Deputy all the recommendations because the report is incredibly complex. I did meet the representatives of these workers, although I do not know if it was the Deputy or somebody else who organised it for me. I understand the exact situation that pertains to the people in the Deputy's county but one cannot make changes to a scheme just to reflect a small number of people in a small part of the country without having far-reaching effects on everybody else. I need to consider the report very carefully, which I will do this weekend, and I will come back to the Deputy with the recommendations I am planning to make to address the issue affecting the people he represents. I agree that the subsidiary payment is small and this might be one of the easier things to reflect on in the report. I ask the Deputy to give me a little time to reflect on the report. I will come back to it and we will resolve this issue.

We are different in Donegal but we are not that different and we have the same seasonal workers in various parts of the country such as Wexford, Waterford, etc. We have waited 12 months so we can wait another few weeks for the Minister to reflect on the report, as long as she is prepared to introduce the realistic recommendations which are contained within the report. Perhaps the Minister and I could also have a chat on the margins of the House at some time.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I am not trying to be smart but I think the people I met in Donegal are special because seasonal workers in the rest of the country are not quite in the same position. In the next couple of weeks, the Deputy and I can talk about how we can specifically fix the issue affecting the people he represents.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	We are very short on time so I ask Deputy Kenny to forgo his 30 seconds to introduce his question.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 49 together. We had a conversation about this under an earlier question. The Family Law Acts are the civil legislation that requires a man or woman who wants to claim maintenance from their spouse to go to family mediation or seek redress through the courts. There is a condition in the one-parent family payment in my Department that a parent must make all reasonable efforts to get maintenance from the other parent for the upbringing of their children, which is as it should be. However, in the past week a very brave young woman went public with her story of how she fell between the cracks of what should have been a robust process but was a process which actually failed her. I met that lovely lady and her gorgeous little man on Friday and we spoke at length of her experience. I heard of the language that was used towards her and the letters she received and I gave her my commitment that I would resolve the issue. Since then, I have met with Women's Aid which is kindly going to take the letters away and redraft them so that, if they were accidentally received by someone in a vulnerable position, they would not make that person as fearful and full of dread as Kate - which is not her real name - was during the week. They will return the new draft to me in the next couple of weeks. We also agreed that Women's Aid would draw up an accredited training programme for me and give it, in conjunction with our staff development unit, to anyone who is involved in front-line services in the Department so that they are equipped to deal with specific instances of domestic or sexual abuse when people present for that purpose. If a woman or a man arrives in a local office and tells us of an experience of domestic violence, we will believe them - end of story. There will be no requirement for court orders or protection orders or other legal structures in such cases. We will believe the person presenting and we will make changes to our internal IT systems so that their electronic record shows no letters for maintenance recovery will ever again be sent to them.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	I wish to put on the record of the House my gratitude to the lady in question, who was here earlier on. If she was not brave enough to go to a young journalist, Ellen Coyne, this week, I do not think I would have been aware of this case. We had heard anecdotal evidence but "he said-she said" scenarios are very difficult to work on. This lady was exceptionally brave. She is a fabulous young woman with a most beautiful son. I thank her and wish her every success in her future.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	I was looking to come in on the previous question but I will put my question instead. What provision is in place for people who are homeless to access social welfare payments such as jobseeker's benefits or any other entitlements?
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, subject to the normal qualifying conditions. The SWA can be paid while a person is awaiting the decision on another payment, for example, disability allowance or jobseeker's allowance. People who are unable to provide evidence of address can access the basic SWA during the period when they engage with homeless services and seek to stabilise their situation. In Dublin, where the homelessness situation is probably at its most acute, there are arrangements in place that focus on maintaining individuals on their primary weekly social welfare payments for a period. This gives them some flexibility while they are seeking to regularise their accommodation arrangements. This approach means they maintain access to the other services that are made available by the Department, including activation programmes, CE schemes and the Tús initiative. People experiencing homelessness who have queries about their entitlement to weekly social welfare payments should contact the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection through their local Intreo offices, where they will receive the same level of care and assistance that we hope to provide to everyone who presents at our local offices.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	I thank the Minister for her reply. It would be remiss of us not to express our condolences on the deaths of two homeless people on the streets of the capital city over the past 24 hours. I do not think anybody really wants to be homeless. The provision of a payment is an essential tool in trying to help people to get off the streets. We need to put money directly into people's pockets. There is an element of discrimination here. The Minister mentioned that specific provision has been made for homeless people in Dublin to access social welfare payments, but such provision is not being made in any other part of the State. Homeless people in 25 counties cannot access minimum or basic social welfare payments. I ask the Minister to explain the discrimination or discrepancy that seems to exist in this regard.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	There is no discrimination. A specific protocol was established for Dublin because, unfortunately, the problem of homelessness is more prevalent here than in other parts of the country. I reiterate that anyone in any part of the country who is experiencing homelessness can avail of weekly social welfare payments and supplementary welfare allowance payments through their local Intreo offices. Payments are maintained for a number of weeks until people can regularise their position with some sort of relatively normal accommodation through the homeless agencies around the country. Specific protocols have been established for Dublin because the Dublin divisions experience homelessness on a greater scale than other areas of the country. We are focusing on maintaining individuals' primary social welfare payments, as well as other services, such as those relating to activation, that they receive while they are engaging with homeless services in Dublin. We want to ensure that they are in a position to regularise their accommodation. Our overarching principle is to ensure that the services of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, including weekly payments, are available to people in these circumstances. Our primary ambition is to help people to get back into employment, thereby enabling them to afford to look after themselves. It is not the case that people have to be in regular accommodation before they can get weekly payments. We will do everything we can to assist people to get into regular accommodation and to regularise their housing arrangements.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	People will have been concerned to learn that the assistant commissioner of the Dublin metropolitan region, Mr. Pat Leahy, has advised that no overtime is to be incurred other than in respect of Operation C-Port and Operation Hybrid. In his instruction, he declared in very stark language:No other overtime is authorised and any operations intended on an overtime basis are hereby cancelled ... The Garda Budget for 2017 has been exhausted. All other operations, events, searches, arrest etc for the remainder of 2017, will be performed by the working units.The Taoiseach might enlighten me on what the reference to "working units" means for policing capacity. Other Garda communications have referred to decommissioning burglary response units and reducing mobile patrols. The only people in the country who could possibly be pleased with this are criminals. Why incentivise them at this juncture? According to the Garda Representative Association, it is simply not possible to police the State without overtime. The association has suggested that thefts and burglaries will increase over Christmas. It is worried that the cancellation of Garda overtime could have major implications for local feuds in Blanchardstown and Finglas, for security operations involving cash-in-transit escorts and retail takings and for public order and roads policing. Will we have enough gardaí to police the severe traffic congestion that is expected over the next six weeks and the drink-driving campaign? Why have drink-driving laws if we will not have gardaí to enforce them over the crucial Christmas period? We are getting reports that similar overtime bans are now being applied in Galway and Cork. Can the Taoiseach explain how we have reached a point at which an assistant commissioner would issue a direction of this nature? I understand that the Select Committee on Justice and Equality will meet tomorrow to consider a Supplementary Estimate of €130 million.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	If enough money is available, it should not be the case in any national system that a declaration of this nature, with so many implications, is made. Did the Garda inform the Department of Justice and Equality that it intended to make this announcement to all gardaí across the country? Surely proper planning would dictate that something like this should not occur at this time of the year. I have a key question. Is the assistant commissioner aware that a Supplementary Estimate is coming before a Dáil committee tomorrow? Has the assistant commissioner already factored in that figure when considering the operational budgets of the force? Has the Garda, even with the knowledge of what it is going to get tomorrow, decided that an overtime ban will be needed in any event? I would like an answer to that question.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	I thank the Deputy. I share the concerns about any ban on overtime in December. As the Deputy mentioned, December is a very busy period. Traffic is very heavy in the run-up to Christmas. There can be a spike in burglaries during this period because it is so dark and because many people tend to be out of their homes. Burglars also need money in the run-up to Christmas. There is often a spike in burglaries at this time. I assure the House that there is funding for overtime in December. I can say that for a number of reasons. The Cabinet agreed yesterday morning that there will be a Supplementary Estimate for the Garda. That covers overtime. Tomorrow morning, the Select Committee on Justice and Equality will be asked to approve a Supplementary Estimate of €50.489 million under the pay subhead of the Department of Justice and Equality. That includes €42 million for overtime, which will bring the total Garda overtime budget for 2017 to €130 million. I think people will appreciate that €130 million is a very big budget for overtime. This is happening at a time when the number of gardaí is increasing again. For example, approximately 200 trainee gardaí are scheduled to attest next month. This will increase Garda numbers to approximately 13,500 by the end of the year when projected retirements are taken into account. An additional 200 full-time gardaí will be available to police the State next month, which is December. In addition, the Supplementary Estimate will cover overtime. It is important to say that almost all pay, including overtime, is paid a month in arrears. This is why I am also keen to understand yesterday's public announcement a bit better. December overtime would never have been paid from the 2017 budget. The Supplementary Estimate is for the 2017 period. While December overtime is worked in December, it is paid in January. This means that next month's overtime will come out of the 2018 budget. I would have hoped or assumed that Garda management would have been aware of that. Any overtime done in December comes out of the 2018 budget, which ,of course, is substantial.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	The Taoiseach has said he shares the concerns about this matter and needs to understand it a bit better. He has said he would have assumed that Garda management knew about these arrangements. This instruction was issued by an assistant commissioner on the basis that "the Garda Budget for 2017 has been exhausted". I think we need a better explanation of how this has happened within our security and policing system.There is an issue at the heart of the administration of security and justice in the country. Something like this should not happen if sufficient funds are available. This needs to be resolved and we need to get answers because people's fears can be heightened in situations like these. The original question I asked the Taoiseach was whether an Garda Síochána had already factored the Supplementary Estimate, which will be provided tomorrow, into its budget and yet still finds itself short. It says here that much of the additional Supplementary Estimate is required as a result of the Labour Court agreement. Overtime is involved, but the cost associated with the implementation of the Labour Court agreement in respect of Garda pay is also a contributory factor as are the off-setting of additional requirements, departmental underspends and so on. It is not yet clear to me that what will be provided in the Vote tomorrow will cover the entirety of what An Garda Síochána needs. Otherwise I presume the assistant commissioner would not have given the instruction he gave to all stations and ranks across the Dublin metropolitan region.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	113	The important thing is to assure the public that the State will be policed throughout December. The number of gardaí is increasing. We will have 200 more gardaí next month. Since 2014 we have seen the number of gardaí continuously increase. We will also have a recruitment campaign for the Garda Reserve next year. We are seeing an increased number of gardaí. With more gardaí joining the force and more gardaí on the streets, one would expect that the need for overtime would fall. Nonetheless, overtime will always be necessary for policing operations, although with increasing numbers of gardaí one would expect the need for overtime to decrease. To answer the Deputy's question, the Supplementary Estimate which will be voted through tomorrow with the agreement of the House provides additional funds for Garda overtime but, as I mentioned earlier, Garda overtime for December is paid out of the 2018 budget anyway, so no Supplementary Estimate is required for that. The very substantial €100 million Garda budget for 2018 covers it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	Is the money therefore owed already?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	It is also important that we ensure Garda management is responsible and held to account for the way budgets are managed. If one has a budget of €100 million for overtime, one has to spread it out over a period of 12 months. There is a responsibility to do that. It is very easy to run out of funds for overtime in November if 9% of the budget is spent every month. Some 99% will have been spent by the end of November and the funds will run out. If 8.3% is spent every month, it will last the full 12 months. Therefore, Garda management have a responsibility to manage the overtime budget in such a way that the money does not run out. However, as I have said, there is a Supplementary Estimate going through tomorrow which will cover all of the overtime costs to the end of November. Funding for December, which as the Deputy knows starts next week, comes out of the budget for 2018 anyway. The 2018 budget for Garda overtime is €100 million.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment that there will be funding for Garda overtime. I am however very disappointed at the way he has handled the recent revelations about the dysfunction at the heart of our justice system. His Government refused to take appropriate actions which would have avoided all of the recent difficulties, not least for Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family. In many ways the Taoiseach repeated the mistakes which Deputy Enda Kenny made when he was Taoiseach. The Taoiseach will recall the fatal shooting of Garda Tony Golden, the serious wounding of Siobhán Phillips and the death by suicide of Crevan Mackin in Omeath on 11 October 2015. Crevan Mackin was arrested for possession of weapons and explosives and admitted to such possession. He was released without being charged with theses offences, despite some detectives knowing that he had access to four other weapons. It is believed he used one of these weapons to murder Garda Tony Golden and seriously wound Ms Phillips, whom he had also brutally beaten, before killing himself. In October 2015 I gave a file on these matters to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, and the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. I wrote to Deputy Kenny four times. I spoke to him directly on a number of occasions. I wrote to Deputy Fitzgerald eight times. I also spoke to her. I gave information to the senior Garda officer investigating the case and I wrote to GSOC. When Deputy Varadkar took over as Taoiseach I sent the same file to him. Like Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach gave me no substantive response until I raised the issue with him here. The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has yet to reply to me. When I asked him informally about this case he said there was something seriously wrong and he committed to meeting with me. He has yet to do so. The answer I received from the previous Taoiseach, from Deputy Varadkar and from the Minister for Justice and Equality is that an investigation and review of these tragic events is ongoing. There are no other suspects. There are no other lines of inquiry. The real issue is that Crevan Mackin was arrested for the possession of weapons and explosives and admitted to that. He was released without being charged with these offences despite some detectives knowing he had access to four other weapons. He used one of these weapons to murder Garda Tony Golden and injure Siobhán Phillips. It is not enough to say that processes are ongoing. This is about accountability or in this case, once again, the lack of accountability. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality to speak to the acting Garda Commissioner as a matter of urgency. If the Taoiseach has read this file he will know the questions he should ask of the acting Garda Commissioner. I ask the Taoiseach to meet with the family of Siobhán Phillips and to establish a public inquiry as the family has requested.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	Obviously the Deputy is free to criticise my handling of the events of recent days, as is anyone, but the basic approach I will always follow is that people should be given a fair hearing and that we should know all the facts before we rush to judgment. I appreciate fully that has never been the approach of Deputy Adams or his party. In the Sinn Féin view of the world people do not deserve a fair hearing, people are executed without trial and punished without getting a fair hearing. I will never operate on that basis. I will always ensure that allegations are taken seriously and are also properly investigated before we rush to judgment. I know that is the kind of approach which Maurice McCabe and his family would support and which should have always been followed in respect of the allegations which he made. It was certainly the approach which I followed when he came to me a number of years ago with allegations in respect of penalty points and with evidence to back them up. That is why on this occasion, before jumping to judgment, we should once again make sure that we know the facts and that allegations are taken seriously and are properly investigated. As it stands with this case, there is an investigation under way. That investigation will not be carried out here in the Dáil, nor should it be. It should be carried out by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which is the body set up and empowered by the Oireachtas to investigate complaints against An Garda Síochána. The GSOC investigation report is still awaited. We should allow that investigation to happen, get the report and then consider the outcome. That is the appropriate role for ourselves as politicians and for this House. I am advised by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that he would be happy to meet Deputy Adams today to discuss the matter further. It is very much my view, however, that we should allow GSOC to carry out its investigation. When we have a report, we can then consider it.

What I have asked him to do is very precise, very simple and very straightforward. I have asked him to speak to the acting Commissioner as a matter of urgency. Forget about me and forget about taking a pot-shot at Sinn Féin. This is a serious issue. No one from the Government that I know of has spoken to the acting Commissioner, or indeed the former Garda Commissioner, on this issue. I am also asking the Taoiseach to meet with the family of Siobhán Phillips and to establish a public inquiry as requested by the family. This is about accountability and it is about leadership. The Taoiseach has said that the Minister will meet with me. That is what he said to me the last time.

When people have complaints to make against An Garda Síochána, there is a body called the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. That body is responsible and empowered to carry out these investigations. We should allow it to carry out its investigation, allow for due process and allow GSOC to make its report. When it has made its report, we can then consider the findings and decide whether further action should be taken. I have no intention whatsoever of superseding that report by permitting a public inquiry.I also have no intention of interfering in the work of the commission.

We are told agreement has also largely been reached on citizenship issues. It seems, therefore, that two of the three phase 1 issues are approaching resolution and that only the Irish question remains to be decided. All we hear on that issue are generalities such as "seamless borders", "frictionless borders" and "technology solutions". Such phrases have popped up again and again, but they have little real meaning. During a ridiculous interview that he gave last night Iain Duncan Smith said there was a great deal of showboating. It is clear that significant efforts are being made by some to downplay the Irish issue. It is also clear that the Conservative Party in Britain, unsurprisingly, continues to have a very weak understanding of the Irish Border issue. All Members understand there is a trade aspect to the Border, but many have expressed concerns that if things are allowed to advance to phase 2 without meaningful and clear commitments on the Irish question, we will lose our leverage. France, Germany and others have clearly prioritised the divorce bill and the rights of citizens. Now that these issues are close to being resolved, Irish concerns might be brushed aside. Technically, there is no veto during these talks as under law decisions will be made by qualified majority vote. We also know that the EU27 have so far indicated that Ireland will be allowed to hold what amounts to a veto on these matters. However, if that is the case, the Taoiseach must make a moral rather than a legal argument in order to hold the EU27 together and he will not be prepared to do so. When faced with implacable opposition, however, he will need to stand firm and not blink. There is to be a Brexit stakeholder forum meeting tomorrow morning and there are valuable opportunities for perspectives to be shared. At this juncture, there is a need for a collective political effort. For months I have been asking the Taoiseach to brief Opposition leaders in detail in advance of European Council meetings and I reiterate that request today. When approaching a meeting as crucial as this one, Deputies of all parties and none should come together to show the EU27 that we stand united together in the interests of the nation. Will the Taoiseach reassure the House that he is willing to deploy what would, in effect, be a veto if meaningful progress to his satisfaction is not achieved on the Irish issue at the next European Council meeting? Will he agree to meet the leaders of all parties to share his plans on a confidential basis and discuss how each of them might assist by directly lobbying our sister parties and organisations throughout Europe to support what is a vital Irish position?

I have set up a system under which a very senior official in my Department is available to brief party leaders on the current state of the negotiations. Some party leaders have availed of it, although I am not sure if each of them has. I have committed to meeting party leaders in that regard and will do so when we are at decision point, but we are not yet at that stage. Things are evolving rapidly and changing on a daily basis. We are in daily contact with the task force headed by Michel Barnier. Much progress is being made on the financial settlement but it has not yet been agreed to. None of the three items on which sufficient agreement is required before we can move to phase 2 has reached the necessary point. Progress is being made but it is insufficient at this stage. We are in regular contact with other Foreign Ministers and Prime Ministers and solidarity remains strong with Ireland on our specific issues, including avoiding a hard border. I am very confident that the European Council will operate by consensus and that there will be no need to use or threaten to use a veto because we have and will continue to have the support of our European colleagues on the issue of the Border.

I want the Taoiseach to provide that reassurance. I welcome the Brexit stakeholder forum which is important, but it involves 60 or 70 people from agencies and so on. In advance of this most critical European Council meeting, I ask the Taoiseach to meet the leaders of parties represented in the House to discuss the strategy and see how we can play a part by talking to socialists and democrats within the European institutions in the case of the Labour Party and liberals in the case of Fianna Fáil and so on in order that we will have a collective, joined-up and manifestly united effort on this vital issue for Ireland. I ask the Taoiseach to agree to these two requests.

That would be a major distraction from the job we are doing on behalf of Ireland on Brexit and in dealing with other governments. However, I will meet party leaders when we get to the point where a decision has to be made and I have a specific request to make of them regarding their political groupings.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	139	During the past week, while within the House there was the fiasco of a crisis that never should have been a crisis, life continued in the real world. Tragically, two homeless men died on the streets, one in Ranelagh on Monday night and the other outside the Four Courts. Two families came to my constituency office having been served with termination notices in respect of their homes in the private rental sector. These families are facing the nightmare of eviction and potential homelessness. One or two such families come to my office every week and it is likely that similar situations take place in the constituency offices of all Dublin Deputies. During the same week Threshold released its annual report which showed a massive increase in the number of people who were contacting it because of a fear of losing their homes, most of whom were in the private rental sector. A total of 71,000 calls were made to Threshold last year, more than double the number made in 2015. A report issued shortly before stated 40,000 homes could be built on public land that had been zoned for housing. Some 12,000 houses could be built on public land in Dublin alone. Considering that the average cost of building a home, leaving aside land costs, is between €180,000 and €200,000, the cost of building 40,000 such homes would be in the region of €7 billion to €8 billion. If that were to be done over a four to five year period, it would cost between €1.5 billion and €2 billion per year. If there was the political will, the money would be found. For example, in the past three budgets income tax revenue has been reduced by some €3 billion. These tax cuts are largely irrelevant to the living standards of those on low to moderate incomes. That is not a once-off cost of €3 billion but rather the amount of State revenue that would be forgone every year. I have no doubt that people would forgo these minimal cuts in income tax in return for a serious attempt to solve the housing crisis. Another potential source of funds is the €1.3 billion that has been set aside for a rainy day. If having over 3,000 homeless children in the State is not a rainy day, I do not know what is. Perhaps the Government is saving it for a new developer or bank bailout. The Nevin Economic Research Institute produced a report last year which outlined the potential adoption of the European cost recovery model which could be a game changer in dealing with the housing crisis. It would involve building homes to be rented at below market rates but at a sufficient amount to recover the initial investment in time. The programme for Government states expert groups should be established to consider developing a viable cost rental model for Ireland.The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, the previous Minister and the Department are all considering this. Does the Taoiseach agree it is time for them to get up off their backsides and implement a programme of public housing on public land?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	140	I want to say how deeply saddened I am, as I think everyone is, to hear of the deaths in recent days of two people who were homeless. On my behalf and on behalf of the entire House, I express my condolences to the families and friends of those affected. We understand that one homeless man in his late 30s who had been sleeping rough at the Four Courts has passed away; The Irish Times reports he was a Lithuanian national and may have died as a result of a drug overdose. The other death occurred in Ranelagh. The cause of the latter death is unknown at this time but we understand that he had been offered shelter. Regarding the actions that are taking place, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has already announced a number of very important measures to ensure that more beds and more shelter are available over the next couple of weeks. Twenty-six additional permanent beds will be provided tonight on Little Britain Street, 25 additional permanent beds in Cabra will be available on Thursday night, and an additional 67 temporary beds will come on stream this week. Therefore, by 18 December we will have 200 more beds available, and by beds I mean single beds or double beds in rooms, not cots. We want to be assured that there is, or at least will be, a bed and shelter available for everyone who needs them in the city not just for the winter period, but beyond into the spring and summer as well. We are also stepping up our actions when it comes to the Housing First programme, whereby not only homes and apartments are provided for people who are homeless, but also wraparound services in order that they are able to stay in the homes or apartments they are given. Since we introduced Housing First solutions, 180 people have already gone from rough sleeping into those solutions. These people were sleeping rough and now have housing with support and have managed to stay in that housing. The Minister will appoint a Housing First director quite soon in order to ensure we can move more people off the streets and into homes through that programme. The Government's plan to build more housing is very much under way. A Supplementary Estimate of €100 million was also approved at Cabinet on Tuesday morning for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. This will enable the Department to meet the costs that have been run up by local authorities in building housing over the past year. Deputies will be aware that 2,000 houses will have been built directly by local authorities by the end of this year, which is a major increase on only a few hundred a year or two ago. We have a €1.8 billion social housing budget for next year for housing, which will allow us to increase the number of social homes built to 3,800. This is almost a doubling and does not include additional social housing acquired by renovating voids, purchasing them from developers, long-term leasing or Part V. This will bring the total number closer to 7,000. Therefore, the issue we will run into is not money at all but rather the capacity of the construction sector to build all these homes. Housebuilding is now ramping up. We can see this from the numbers and we are starting to see it around us, all around the country. The constraining factor will not be money from the Government, but rather the availability of sites and construction workers and others to build the houses we desperately need.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	I thank the Taoiseach for his report on the homelessness crisis, but what I wanted to raise with him is public housing on public land. That was the main content of my question. He sort of half dealt with it. Part of the approach of Rebuilding Ireland includes the proposal to have 125,000 people in HAP households. By 2021, that will cost the State €1 billion a year. Providing these 120,000 social housing units through HAP will cost €32.9 billion over 30 years. That money would be much more deservedly put into public housing on public lands. We know that Dublin City Council has public lands on which to build at least 12,000 houses. It should get more land through other methods of acquiring land in Dublin. The Taoiseach opened a housing development recently at which he mentioned that it contained affordable homes but he forgot to mention that these houses were selling for between €320,000 and €390,000, which is certainly not affordable. We need affordable homes for workers in Tesco and Dunnes, on construction sites and in the general economy who earn under €50,000. This can be done through the plan put forward by Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute.

It allows them to live in private rented accommodation, often - almost always, in fact - in a private housing estate or private apartment block. I know from my experience in my own constituency that many people living with a HAP tenancy or with rent supplement in a private housing estate or a private housing development, when offered social housing, decide not to take it because they would prefer to stay where they are as their children are in the local school, they have connections to the area and they want to stay in the housing they are in at that time. Many people make this decision because it works for them to stay in private rented accommodation on occasion. It also helps to bring about integrated communities. We do not particularly want to go back to the era of huge social housing estates which generate or become a focus for social problems. We want integrated developments as much as possible. It is our intention to reduce our reliance on rent supplement initially and HAP as we build more social housing. There will be a €25 million funded affordability scheme for public lands, and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, will produce the information on this as soon as he possibly can with new income limits.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	In the programme for Government, under the subheading "Ireland-UK Relations", it is stated, "Building on the successful state visits [and so on], we will continue to enhance Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom [and so forth]". Amid everything that has happened in the past two weeks, there was a very serious breach and leak of foreign affairs documentation. Our diplomats, as he knows, tour capitals across Europe and the rest of the world. They interview people, including senior people in governments, politicians, civil servants, judges and stakeholders in society. They do so to get some understanding of what drives policy in different capitals across Europe. I am a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and those documents are invaluable in building up what one could call low-grade intelligence in terms of understanding what is going on in other capitals to inform policy and the Government's response. Such a document - I cannot remember a precedent for this-----

In light of the programme for Government commitment and the damage this has done to our relationship with Britain, about which there is no doubt, will the Taoiseach confirm that an investigation of that breach has taken place? Will he undertake to update the House in this regard and let us know the outcome of that investigation, if indeed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has commissioned one?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	I am happy to answer that question. The Deputy will understand this only too well as a former Minister in the Department. We get weekly working briefings from our diplomatic missions across the European Union giving us feedback on the issues of the week and the day. Obviously, there is a lot of feedback on Brexit at present. In this case that weekly briefing documentation, which is circulated quite widely within not only the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but also some other Departments in order to keep people informed of the state of play as we get feedback from our various different consulates and embassies was leaked to a journalist.It should not have happened and we are engaged in an internal investigation within the Department to discover how it did. We are also reviewing the circulation of working briefing documents on a weekly basis to ensure it does not happen again. We have explained that very clearly to our counterparts in the British Government.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	150	In May, the Supreme Court ruled that the absolute prohibition on asylum seekers pursuing employment, as set out in subsection 9(4) of the Refugee Act 1996, is unconstitutional. The Government, which had until tomorrow to respond to the court's imposed deadline, announced plans several weeks ago to opt into an EU directive providing for and regulating asylum seekers' access to the workforce. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has since confirmed that the Government will opt into the reception conditions directive. Will the Taoiseach confirm when that opt-in will come into force and how quickly the people affected by this issue will be able to access employment? Will he further indicate when we will see the detail of the new system, including provisions relating to access to vocational training and health care and any restrictions to be imposed in terms of the types of jobs for which people can apply? Finally, will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil whether the interdepartmental group that is to oversee this procedure and the practical arrangements for applications has been established and when it will report?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	The Government agreed last week to implement full compliance with the request from the Supreme Court earlier this year. The Deputy is correct that the deadline is tomorrow. My understanding is that the court will be satisfied with the course we are pursuing and will, I am sure, make a declaration to that effect in early course. The date upon which the new regime is to be implemented is April next year, in accordance with our EU obligations. I expect there will be an important role and function for the implementation group in overseeing this process. Last week, I circulated to all Deputies a note of the decision of Government on this matter. I would be happy to have the matter debated in full in the House as soon as the Business Committee agrees to it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	The programme for Government includes various commitments in regard to achieving full employment, noting that work is key to independence and social integration. The House has repeatedly agreed motions seeking to make employment sustainable and ensure decent working conditions for employees. There has been much debate in recent days about the consequences of an early election. In the midst of all that discussion, I was struck by a report by Jack Power in The Irish Times which pointed to the significant numbers of people employed in the Oireachtas on if-and-when contracts. That this is happening sends a poor message to employers. Will the Taoiseach join with me in asking the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to ensure if-and-when contracts are no longer given to staff employed by it?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	153	The running of the Oireachtas is and ought to be a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The Government has legislative plans to ban zero-hour contracts and ensure people have more security in respect of the hours they work. Sometimes, however, if-and-when contracts may be necessary and can work for the employee, particularly where there is an on-call or agency arrangement. As I said, the Government will introduce legislation to ban zero-hour contracts and ensure workers have greater certainty as to the hours they are working so that they can plan their lives and finances. However, I will leave actual contractual matters for staff to the good offices of the commission.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	154	Yesterday, following the resignation of the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach referred to the Department of Justice and Equality as dysfunctional. We are all aware of the issues to be examined by the disclosures tribunal, which we will discuss this evening. The Taoiseach promised an external review of all the matters that have arisen in recent weeks. Given those very strong statements, will he indicate the precise extent of this external review of matters related to the Department of Justice and Equality? The issues are relevant not only to the whistleblower scandal but are also evident in the discovery that 2 million false breath tests were carried out by gardaí and there were 15,000 wrongful convictions as a result. More than 100 solicitors are taking legal action of behalf of some of those who were wrongly convicted.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	155	The Deputy's time is up.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	The O'Sullivan report suggested there will be no accountability from those in top Garda management and no disciplinary action imposed on them. These are the people who were condemned in the report for the incredible level of malpractice within the force. The public does not accept a level of dysfunctionality that results in 2 million false breath tests and 15,000 wrongful convictions. We must have accountability in this regard.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	I do not anticipate that the sweep, as referred to by the Deputy, will include matters germane to the Policing Authority or the Garda Síochána. The defined terms of reference of the external review refer to the disclosure or otherwise of documentation to the disclosures tribunal. I understand the Deputy's comments arise out of reports of the meeting that took place last week between the acting Garda Commissioner and the Policing Authority. I look forward to meeting again shortly with the chairman and members of the authority, at which meeting the matter the Deputy has raised will be given further consideration. My understanding is that an investigation is under way under the auspices of an assistant commissioner. The particulars of that investigation will be tendered to me on its completion.

The delegates saw the Minister for Health in the corridor but were not talking to him. This is a life-changing drug for children with the rare condition, Morquio syndrome. It is very sad to hear the stories of the families concerned. The drug is manufactured in Cork, in the constituency of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and is available throughout Europe. I do not know what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, finds so funny about it. This is a very serious situation affecting a small number of families who are requesting a meeting with the Minister for Health. One child from Monaghan has been prescribed the drug, which is paid for by the HSE but can only be purchased in the North. It is not possible to get it in this State, even though it is manufactured here. It is a bizarre situation.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	As Deputy McGrath outlined, a group from the Irish MPS Society, including children with Morquio syndrome and their parents, met with Deputies this morning and are in the Public Gallery now. The group includes two children who are being treated with Vimizim. We all meet thousands of people in the course of our life, especially those of us here in the Oireachtas, but sometimes one meets a person who is unique and whose humanity shines through. That is the case with the two children we met this morning. The Minister for Health has agreed to meet the delegation for a few minutes, which I am delighted to hear, but I urge the Taoiseach, too, to meet the children before they leave. It is always clear when we meet people who are special and different. I ask that the Taoiseach listen for five minutes to what these two children have to say. If he does so, I am absolutely confident he will ensure the drug is approved for all children with this illness. It is totally wrong that they have been left in their current situation.

As Deputy McGrath noted, in one particular case a child has been prescribed the drug, paid for the HSE, but has to purchase it in the North. Other children cannot avail of it. There is something badly wrong in that situation. I urge the Minister for Health to meet the children and their parents to hear about their circumstances.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	163	I join previous speakers in drawing the attention of the Minister and the Taoiseach to the situation of the young people and their parents who we met this morning. It is vital that the Minister for Health should meet them today, as he has undertaken to do.It was a cross-party group that met them this morning. I support the calls in respect of this matter.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	I understand that there is one child to whom the company is continuing to give the medicine. If the Minister meets the other children, he will discover that it is incredible the way they are able to tell their stories. The Minister needs to look at this case and at least meet the families. Show them the respect of that and get the HSE officials to recognise the problem.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	I always show people respect but the Deputies also need to be very truthful about where this power lies, based on the laws passed by this House. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 very clearly means that the HSE is the decision-making body on this. I know that this is a very important and sensitive matter. It is very important for the families and I absolutely understand why they would be rightly worried, upset and concerned. On 7 November last, the HSE made a decision not to add Vimizim to its reimbursement list. In doing so, the HSE has made it very clear to the company that the company can come back to the table and produce new evidence and negotiate. During my time as the Minister for Health, we have seen people come to the table to negotiate, even in extraordinarily difficult circumstances relating to trying to access new drugs, and we can often find a way forward. I urge colleagues to not just call on the Government to act, but to also call on the drug company to sit down with the HSE and negotiate a way forward. I understand that a small number of children are on an access scheme for this drug. It is extraordinarily important that the drug company acts in an ethical manner. The Declaration of Helsinki is very clear that access schemes and reimbursement should not be linked. There is absolutely no way this House should stand over the removal of children from an access scheme for that drug. I would be delighted to have a word with the families today, and to keep in touch with Deputies on this. I believe, however, that people need to get back to the negotiating table.

The EU Commission has stated that the difference with PESCO relates to the binding nature of the commitment undertaken by member states in the context of various forms of co-operation it covers. The Secretary General of NATO has indicated that this measure would strengthen the EU pillar within NATO. This will lead to a massive increase in defence spending and in the development of the defence industry. It has huge implications for Ireland in the context of budgets and the nature of our Defence Forces. When will we have a proper debate on this historic development, which needs to be decided upon by the House and not just the Cabinet?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	This issue came to the Government last week and we agreed to bring it before the House. There will be a full debate on it before a decision is made by this House. The proposal for more structured co-operation on defence and security issues across the European Union has been in development for a number of years. It does not, however, oblige Ireland to do anything. The structure has, essentially, a voluntary opt-in that allows Ireland to choose the projects in respect of which we want partnerships with other countries. Perhaps these could be in areas such as marine surveillance, peacekeeping, training or cyber security. This is a practical response by the European Union to create more structure around co-operation when countries choose, on a voluntary basis, to work together in a more coherent way. The Government will be recommending that Ireland supports the programme, but there will be an opportunity for all Members to have their say on the matter when we debate it in the House.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	On the programme for Government, the Taoiseach informed me six weeks ago that the N4 and the N5, which are national primary routes, would be included in the national plan. The Taoiseach also said that, with the economy improving, he hoped that more money would be available for national secondary and regional roads. Last Monday, in the county in which I live, Roscommon, Transport Infrastructure Ireland informed the local authority of a 17% to 30% cut in the maintenance grant for national primary and national secondary roads. I do not expect the Taoiseach to make an announcement now but I ask that he speak with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport today in order to get this cut reversed as quickly as possible. The cut in question will have consequences for safety on and other issues relating to those roads. I wonder if the same is happening in other counties. It is a massive cut. Earlier, we heard from my party leader about the cut in Garda overtime. Obviously, the position in that regard will be rectified. These cuts to the roads budget also need to be rectified or they will have consequences going forward. I do not expect the Taoiseach to make an announcement today but it is important that he should deal with the matter.

The Deputy will be aware from the budget announcements that the overall transport budget has been increased for next year and for every year up to 2021. I cannot understand why there would be a cut of that nature in roads maintenance. I will have the matter checked out.

The report, which was published on 11 July 2014, included five serious issues, 18 recommendations and a timeframe of two years. Had those recommendations been implemented, we would not be in the mess in which we find ourselves. The review group actually offered "to meet twice yearly, if required by the Minister, over the next two years to review progress made in implementing these recommendations." Will the Taoiseach let us know if any Minister took the review group up on that offer? If so, how often did they meet and which, if any, of the 18 recommendations have been implemented?

The majority of the recommendations of the Toland report are now in an advanced state of implementation. Many have been implemented. Following the initiative on the part of the Taoiseach, which was announced yesterday, a further level of consideration will be given to bolster the recommendations of the Toland report with further proposals to ensure a smoother running of certain issues within the Department. I keep in very close contact with the members of my management team, with whom I have had the opportunity of engaging today. I assure Deputy Connolly and the House that every effort will be made within the timeframe to ensure the full implementation of the Toland report recommendations. However, having regard to the events of the past two weeks, we are looking at going beyond Toland.

I am concerned that farmers supply to the food chain through multinational supermarkets which, because we have lost so many grocers and small shops, are gaining a monopoly in the market. The consumer will have to pay what these multinational supermarkets demand. There is also a monopoly being imposed on farmers by the meat factories. What is the Government going to do to protect farmers' incomes in the context of their dealings with the multinational supermarket companies and the meat factories?

It is an objective of Government to protect farm incomes and that will be a major feature as we enter into negotiations for the new phase of the Common Agricultural Policy after 2020. Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be able to answer this query better by means of a parliamentary question or Topical Issue Matters.

We are almost a decade into the housing crisis. The Taoiseach and the Government have been in government for the past seven years. The landbanks have also been there for that length of time and longer. There are more than 4,000 people and families on the housing waiting list in Louth, many of whom have been waiting for over nine years. There are more people on the housing waiting list in Louth than the entire council-owned housing stock in the county. This shows the significance of the housing crisis in County Louth.However, the Government is still refusing to build social housing on these landbanks. Approximately 20 minutes ago the Taoiseach said money was no object in the roll-out of house building but that sites were a problem. Not for the first time, I am telling the Government that there are 53 acres of local authority-owned land in County Louth. As we have the sites and money is no object, when will the Government roll out a social housing building programme in County Louth on council-owned landbanks which sit idle and barren in the midst of a crisis?

We are trying to use it as a template for local authorities nationally which are not doing it as well as Louth County Council. In the next two weeks I will be writing to the chief executives of all local authorities, as well as to every councillor and Member of the Dáil, with the targets for each local authority area. They will be able to see exactly what social housing is to be delivered on each of their landbanks.

This is a matter included in the programme for Government. Executives in rural development authorities have been told by officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that shovels are not likely to be in the ground in the first three months of 2018. In fact, they think it will be the summer or the autumn before work commences. They are now saying 540,000 rural houses and businesses will not receive broadband next year. That is what is being reported in today's edition of the Irish Independent and I thank the newspaper for setting it out. It is important factual information which we did not have until now. I ask the Taoiseach to make a statement, taking into consideration that the national broadband plan is included in the programme for Government.

As the Deputy knows, there are only two bidders left. Inevitably, these things take time. There has to be a tender process and a contract and a further short period during which the unsuccessful bidder can challenge the process. At that point, the contractor has to mobilise and get the work done. After many years of delay, I am extremely confident that we will have the contract signed and that the work will get under way in 2018. The 500,000 homes and premises to which the Deputy referred will be connected in the next couple of years. I share the frustration of the House at the delays in getting to this point but 2018 will be the year it will happen.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I direct my question to both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. On page 81 of the programme for Government it is stated the Government is committed, with Tusla, to providing targeted intervention services for children. The Waterford unit of the ISPCC is being closed on Friday, 1 December. It is manned by 35 volunteers and two full-time staff who take 30,000 calls a year and support 20 families annually with a unique mentoring service. Tusla provides €9,000 but the cost of running the unit is €100,000. I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach for a four-week stay on the decision to allow a solution to be found by 31 December.

Most recently, we have worked with it on the cases of children who have been made homeless. It is regrettable that it has decided that it has to close the office in Waterford and the two services it provides there. I understand from our recent conversations with it that any child from Waterford and the south east will continue to have full access to Childline. My understanding of how the service works is that when a child calls, he or she may be connected to a person who could be in any part of the country. I understand the mentoring service that is run from the office is mostly provided by volunteers for the ISPCC. They are finishing their work with some children and families. In cases where they have not finished it, they are working with local services to hand them over. That is my understanding of how, in the context of the decision to close, the ISPCC is ensuring the children in need will receive what they require. I will continue to work closely with the ISPCC to see if it is possible to find further funding in the new year.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	Overnight, a change was announced to the mortgage lending rules of the Central Bank. In essence, it has become harder for second-time buyers to move on. We are all well aware of the chronic difficulties in the housing market. Apparently, the change is based on a presumption that second-time buyers are more settled and secure than first-time buyers. While that might be the position in a normally functioning market, many people coming out of negative equity and a recession are not in that position. This issue has a knock-on effect on supply because first-time buyers who face a lack of new builds will not be able to buy a home in the second-hand market which has been throttled. That, of course, in turn, has a knock-on effect on the rental market as there is no supply at that stage. The whole pyramid is throttled. I am aware that there is a limit to the extent to which the Government can instruct the Central Bank, but there are fora such as the Central Bank Commission in which policy matters can be discussed. I am sure it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Government to tackle this issue in other ways also. This is a real issue for many buyers and it affects the market as a whole. I hope the Government can address it.

The only legislative relationship in this area requires that we be informed of what the Central Bank is doing, but it makes its decision and announces it. As the Deputy said, there are other measures at which we are looking to increase the supply of homes. There are also measures in the Finance Bill which I hope will be passed in the Seanad soon. I hope those measures will address some of the issues raised by the Deputy.

The role of the social policy and public service reform division is to support me, as Taoiseach, and the Government in delivering on the programme for Government objective of public policies and services which support a socially inclusive and fair society. The division supports the work of Cabinet committee B and the associated senior officials group. This covers social policy and public service reform and seeks to ensure a co-ordinated approach to policy areas such as education, children, equality and reform of public services. It also supports the work of Cabinet committee E and the associated senior officials group. They deal with issues relating to health, including improvements in health service delivery and the development of the Government's response to the Sláintecare report. The division also provides the secretariat for the Civil Service Management Board which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and oversees implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan and incorporates the programme for Government office which publishes regular progress reports on implementation of the programme for Government. The division is also responsible for liaison with the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which falls within the remit of my Department and supports the north-east inner city initiative, including the programme implementation board and the oversight group.The division also provides me with briefings and speech material on social policy and public service reform issues and participates in relevant interdepartmental committees with other groups. Given the nature of its role the division works closely with the line Departments which have day to day responsibility for specific policy areas.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	The Taoiseach has outlined the broad remit for the social policy and public service reform division but it is fair to say that its responsibility to ensure that public policies and services are socially inclusive and fair, that they concern equality, is not working. The Taoiseach has already acknowledged that a homeless citizen died yesterday and there are reports that another homeless citizen died today. The Taoiseach has extended his condolences to the family involved. I also extend my condolences. The Peter McVerry Trust has said that seven homeless people have died in the past 12 weeks. That is totally unacceptable. This situation of course demands our condolences but it demands much more than that. We are told that 184 citizens are lying in the cold and it is bitterly cold now. It is reported that 50 adults were in the Merchant's Quay night café because they were unable to get an emergency bed. I know the Taoiseach dealt with this earlier but I would like him to outline again the emergency measures the Government has planned to help citizens sleeping on the streets, in shop doorways or in tents and to deal with the trauma for 3,000 children and their parents who will celebrate Christmas living in totally inappropriate accommodation. There are rumours, although I cannot support them, that some of those in hotels and boarding houses may lose their places because some of those establishments are looking for other customers. Will the Government revisit the Focus Ireland amendment to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 to limit landlords issuing vacant possession notices to quit?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	198	The Taoiseach may have received an email from Peter McVerry today pointing out that seven individuals have died sleeping rough in the past 12 weeks, which is both unprecedented and shameful. There is the shocking fact that 3,000 children are in emergency accommodation. Peter McVerry is asking for very specific things to respond to this. Will the Taoiseach agree to what he is asking for? He wants a formal assessment of the number of people sleeping rough carried out by local authorities; local authorities to provide a dedicated phone number for members of the public who can identify people sleeping rough in their areas so that help can be given to them; each local authority to have a dedicated rough sleeper response team with transport to cover out-of-hours periods; a commitment that rough sleeping would be ended completely by 2018 which he points out that requires between 250 and 300 people to be housed through the Housing First programme; and that each local authority draw up a Housing First plan to house rapidly and offer intensive case management to recently housed former rough sleepers. Will the Taoiseach agree to that? I want the Taoiseach to reconsider the comments he made earlier about the problems of big social housing estates. This is the excuse for not delivering the scale of public housing we need on the public housing land that we have. Problems generated in social housing estates are not because of anything intrinsic to social housing estates. They are to do with the lack of infrastructure put into estates built in the past. We need large scale provision of council housing with the infrastructure and services but that cannot be an excuse for not delivering the scale of public housing we need to address this crisis.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	The social policy and public service reform division of the Department of the Taoiseach is a very important one. I understand the position of assistant secretary, the most senior in the division, is now vacant. When will it be filled? I join others who have spoken about the announcement that two citizens of our country, rough sleepers, have been found dead on the streets in recent days. On my behalf and on behalf of the party, I send condolences to the friends and families involved. There are 8,000 homeless people, 3,000 of whom are children. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has said that these statistics will worsen and that speaks volumes of itself. Rough sleepers should be an isolated policy focus for the Government. This is a very complex issue and the solution is not simply housing. That is why the wraparound supports of the Housing First model have been recommended. This is the most urgent focus we need. What will the Government do to ensure that the needs of the 180 plus people who are rough sleepers will be addressed? 
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	How many people work in the social policy and public service reform division and how many work on the Sláintecare report and policy which the Taoiseach says the Government is considering? The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that the communications unit, which is under his command – he picked the head man for it - would organise communications campaigns particularly on the children's hospital. I would have thought that as the children's hospital has a bespoke legislative framework it would have its own public relations-----

It does not belong to the Taoiseach although he has sometimes claimed it does. The decisions predated the Taoiseach's role. The former Minister for Health, now Senator Reilly, had an impact. Mary Harney even had an impact but the planning derailed that project.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	My point is that there is a sense that the real function of the communications unit and the €5 million of taxpayers' money is to promote the Government and the Ministers, not the hospital. I genuinely believe there is a danger in how this grows and evolves. If a hospital is a self-contained entity in its work it is difficult to comprehend why its communications agenda is located within the Department of the Taoiseach. All the good news relating to it therefore is for the Taoiseach. The blurring of party politics with the Civil Service is a governance issue that the Taoiseach does not understand. We need to be very careful about it. I do not see why it is necessary to have a separate campaign on the children's hospital while there is a bespoke model and framework there already.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	The range of questions was diverse but I will do my best to answer as many as I can. Deputy Adams is of course correct in saying that approximately seven homeless people have died in recent weeks. Roughly speaking, between 40 and 50 homeless people die every year. Each one is a tragedy and very sad. People who are homeless die for all sorts of different reasons, whether physical health, overdose, addiction, mental health issues, suicide or violence on some occasions. That speaks to the fact that this is such a complex social issue and is not just a simple matter of providing shelter or housing. A range of supports is required, particularly in the health area, relating to mental health and addiction, and overdose in particular. That is a difficult problem that we face as a country. It is one faced all over the world. Additional beds are being provided to ensure that we have a surplus number of beds available in the city and around the country.Approximately 60 will come onstream today, with another 60 before the end of the week, on Little Britain Street and in Cabra. The intention is to have another 200 beds in single or double rooms. They are not Florence Nightingale institutional type accommodation. We will have 200 in place by 18 December and the intention is to ensure there is a bed and shelter available for everyone who wants it and needs it. This is something we want to ensure is in place not just for the winter period, but also through to spring and summer. We have also had the development of the family hubs, of which people are aware, providing much more appropriate family-type accommodation, where people can make their own food and have access to recreational areas. As a result of the development of family hubs, the number of families with children who are being accommodated in bed and breakfasts and hotels has fallen since it peaked last spring. We hope to see more progress on this front in the coming months. Housing First was specifically mentioned, and I mentioned it earlier myself. It is a programme to take people who are rough sleeping and provide them with housing, but not just housing. They need to be able to hang onto the housing so we need to put in place a range of social, health and other supports so they can stay in the house or apartment they are given and do not end up rough sleeping again. A total of 180 people have already been moved out of homelessness and rough sleeping into a Housing First model. At the request of the various charities and agencies that work in the sector, a national director for Housing First will be appointed. That appointment will be made in the next two weeks. I hope it will make a difference in the months and years ahead. On public housing, as I mentioned earlier, 2,000 houses, or homes, will have been directly built by local authorities this year. This needs to be ramped up over time. It was only a couple of hundred a few years ago and we are up to 2,000 this year. It will be 3,800 next year, in addition to the voids being brought into use and long-term leases such as the Iveagh Trust one I was at a couple of days ago. I know people do not count them, but I think they should be counted and certainly the people living in them are counted. There are also direct purchases from developers through Part V and other mechanisms. These will bring the number of new social homes available to be occupied to more than 7,000 next year for people and their families. We will see a real ramping up in the provision of public housing in the coming years. In terms of general supply, commencement notices are up significantly, as are planning permissions. We are seeing about a 50% increase in all of these, so we are starting to see the development of new homes and houses in Dublin and throughout the country, but it is coming from a very low base and we acknowledge as a Government that it will take time for us to get to the point where the number of new homes is meeting the demand for new homes and then to get ahead of it. This is not something we will be able to do quickly, and no Government would be able to do it quickly. I was struck by the honesty of the Sinn Féin housing spokesperson at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis recently, where he enunciated the Sinn Féin policy on social housing, which is to build approximately 10,000 a year until the housing list is cleared. That would still leave people waiting nine or ten years on the housing list before they would get their house. It would require two terms of Sinn Féin in office for people joining the housing list today to get social housing. I thought that was very honest. It is the reality of what it will take to get on top of these issues, because we cannot just ramp up social housing or private housing overnight. There are capacity constraints of all sorts, but we are going to ramp it up as quickly as we possibly can, and that is with regard to social housing as well as private housing.

I attended the social summit for fair jobs and growth in Gothenburg, Sweden, on 17 November, with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Affairs, Deputy Doherty, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee. This was organised jointly by Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Löfven, and European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker. The social summit gathered EU leaders, social partners and other stakeholders for an open discussion on how to promote fair jobs and growth. The focus was on learning from each other's national experiences, particularly in making the most of new opportunities, and tackling common challenges for the labour markets and welfare models of today and tomorrow.  During the summit, the inter-institutional proclamation on the European pillar of social rights was signed by the Presidents of the Council, Parliament and Commission. This represents important reinforcement of political commitment by the member states and the EU institutions to supporting key social policy objectives at both national and EU levels.  The social summit was followed by a working lunch for leaders, chaired by the European Council President, Donald Tusk. This was the first in a series of discussions under his leaders' agenda, as endorsed by the European Council in October, and it focused on education and culture. While the EU has limited competence in these areas, we had constructive exchanges on how we could do more, including on initiatives such as a stronger Erasmus programme. I expect that the outcome of both the social summit and our leaders' agenda discussion will be reflected in the conclusions we adopt at the forthcoming December European Council. I also had a meeting with the Prime Minister May in Gothenburg and reported to the House on 22 November all about this meeting. I did not have any formal meetings with other Heads of State and Government while in Gothenburg. However, I did take the opportunity, as is customary at these events, to speak with many of them on many issues in the margins of the summit and during the meals. I have not yet had the opportunity for a formal meeting with Polish Prime Minister Szydlo. However, I did speak to her in Gothenburg in June and October at the European Councils, and at September’s digital summit in Tallinn. We sat beside each other for one of the meals. Ongoing political engagement with our EU and international partners remains crucial, especially as negotiations on Brexit proceed, and I will continue to take advantage of every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests with my fellow members of the European Council.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	I am glad the Taoiseach attended Gothenburg because, hopefully, this is a return to an EU which will develop a serious anti-poverty programme not just for Ireland, but for the whole of the EU and particularly for countries such as Greece, which have not been able to exit their problems. I want to ask the Taoiseach about two issues. When I was Minister for Social Protection, there was a lot of work done at an incredibly slow pace on a European social pillar, in other words, and this is what Gothenburg was partly about, a strong social security system in each country. It would be a Europe of strong social security systems in each country that would help people and provide a cushion of safety. Most importantly, we will not get people out of poverty and into a reasonably comfortable standard of living unless we address wages. Does the Taoiseach agree with some of the thinking about Gothenburg, that we need to maintain wage levels in the European Union as an absolute priority? This is something I know Fine Gael does not like, but we must return to social partnership and have national agreements that actually help those people at the bottom of the wage scale, including people who are bogusly self-employed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	The European social pillar document and strategy launched at the summit sets out a series of principles of social policy, which are accepted by member states. It has no justiciable basis, of course, but it is intended as a means of setting broad objectives for national and European Union activity.It is a very worthy document but it is not clear what importance is attached to it. It is a pity the Government did not publish a national position on that document beforehand, which we could have debated in the House. There is a failure when we develop inflated rhetoric about social policy which is not followed up by action because of basic issues such as the European Union budget and widely differing social support systems. I recall plenty of rhetoric around social guarantees and the Youth Guarantee but it was just rhetoric, with little funding to support it. Can the Taoiseach detail what specific actions he is undertaking following the signing of the European Pillar of Social Rights? The document mentions individual access to housing and the Taoiseach will note that, despite the attempt to relativise homelessness figures at the Fine Gael conference, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has admitted the problem will get worse. I have heard that phrase previously. When the Taoiseach was appointed Minister for Health one of his first pronouncements was that the situation would get worse and, by God, it did get worse. I got very worried, therefore, when the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government said at the Fine Gael conference that the situation would get worse. How much worse will it get before it will improve? Has the Taoiseach any idea of what his Minister was commenting on?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	The Taoiseach noted the importance of continued contacts with our European partners on Brexit. The media today are reporting that the British have agreed to pay between €45 billion and €55 billion in its settlement of the divorce bill. That will obviously increase demands by the British that the European Union meeting two weeks hence will accept this as substantial progress and move to negotiations on a new trade deal. That means there will be a focus on what progress has been made on two outstanding issues of the current negotiations, the Border and the status of EU citizens in the North. So far, there has been no detailed plan from the British for how they intend to resolve these matters. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, have been insisting, quite rightly, that no progress can be made to advance to the trade talks without real guarantees and commitments from the British on the Border. I acknowledge that it is better to resolve all these issues diplomatically, but we are now coming to a critical point in the negotiations. The Taoiseach has a veto. Is he prepared to use it? I appeal to him to be resolved to do so. The right of citizens in the North to EU citizenship is a fundamental part of this. I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure there is progress on both of these issues and that this be the Government's red line in the forthcoming negotiations.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	232	The Taoiseach will agree there has been a great deal of strain on the European project in recent years, with increased nationalism and an increased number of votes for nationalist and anti-EU parties across the European Union. He will probably agree that much of that is predicated on the loss of faith in the European project as a social project that impacts positively on the people of Europe and not simply an international trade agreement, as it is sometimes characterised particularly by some commentators in the United Kingdom. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that signing the European Pillar of Social Rights is a fundamental and important readjustment? On a number of occasions I raised the fact that in the negotiations preceding this agreement Ireland sought to water it down. That was not an auspicious or desirable stand for the country to take. However, now that it has been signed it is important, and Deputy Martin made this point, to have an Irish implementation plan. Is it the Taoiseach's view that we must reconnect with people to ensure that the vision of Europe is a social Europe that incorporates rights for working people and standards of decency? Will we have an implementation plan on issues such as zero-hour and if-and-when contracts and other important matters such as housing and so forth? Will the Taoiseach undertake to produce such a national implementation plan?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	If I was going to a summit on social issues in Europe I would certainly make the point, and I hope the Taoiseach did this, that the biggest social crisis facing this country is housing and homelessness and that it is at appalling emergency levels. A little known fact, but one noted by Mercy Law Resource Centre among others, is that, incredibly, Ireland opted out of the right to housing provisions of the European Social Charter, even though it was used to sell the Lisbon treaty to us. I presume it was Fianna Fáil that made this decision, which shows its commitment to social housing even then. Should we not opt into the provision on the right to housing in the European Social Charter? Second, to what extent does the Taoiseach think that EU state aid and competition rules are causing us a problem in delivering the social and public housing we need? Certainly in my local authority area, and I presume this happens everywhere else, the tendering processes that require us most of the time to outsource work on public housing are one of the major areas of bureaucracy and delay preventing us from delivering the public housing that is required.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	234	There was a wide range of questions, a number of which are tangential to the questions that were tabled. However, as always, I will try my best to answer as many questions as possible. I was pleased to represent the Government at Gothenburg for the social summit. As I mentioned in my video piece at the end of the summit with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy McEntee, it was an opportunity for us to reignite the engine of social Europe. There is a sense across Europe, not just among politicians but particularly among citizens, that in the last decade Europe has focused so much on banking, deficits, fiscal matters, finance and trade it has been to the detriment of everything else. Europe has never just been an economic community or a free trade area. It has always been about more than that. Many of the labour and social rights we have in Ireland flow from European law, whether it is equal pay for equal work or the fact that child benefit was moved from being paid to the father to being paid to the mother. It all happened as a consequence of progressive European legislation. The vision set out in the paper is very much one that was shared by the Christian democrats and social democrats who established the European project in the first place. That vision was of a social market economy, the belief that market economies are the best ways to produce wealth and employment for people while also recognising the role of government in ensuring social progress by using the market economy and harnessing its wealth and job producing effects to bring about social good. The original speeches of the famous men and women who founded the European Economic Community spoke a great deal about the social market economy. It is a political philosophy that my party very much supports. We are very supportive of the declaration. While we had some reservations along the way we were happy to sign it. Of course, it is not legally binding but it will guide future European regulations and directives in areas such as labour rights, social protection and pension rights. One of the points I made was that it had to work in terms of portability. The world of work is changing all the time. Most people entering the workforce now will probably have a number of different employers, will be self-employed for periods of their life and employees for other periods and they will probably travel a great deal. They will work in more than one country. However, our social welfare systems are not set up to reflect that properly. This gives us an opportunity to develop more European law in these areas. It is interesting and fascinating, however, to see the different approaches that countries adopt to it.A number of people in this House would see the Nordic countries and their flexicurity model as being one of the better and more developed labour markets and social market economies, but the Nordic countries are among the most sceptical when it comes to further EU harmonisation in this area because they feel harmonisation and making things the same across Europe could harmonise things downwards. They are among the countries that are most sceptical about the European Pillar of Social Rights for that reason. It is fascinating to see the different perspectives people have.  We discussed the possibility of a European minimum wage. I spoke very much in favour of a European minimum wage but, of course, that would be on the basis that there would then be a national top up to take account of the different costs of living in different European countries. In terms of social partnership, I am very pleased that the Government was able to negotiate a very good public sector pay deal with the public sector unions. Legislation for that is now going through the House and will bring about pay restoration and pay increases in some cases throughout next year and through to 2020. When it comes to social partnership with the private sector, both IBEC and ICTU take the view that they do not want to go down that road and that the existing bargaining mechanisms are working for them and their members, but it is not something we would rule out in the future if we needed to achieve price stability among other things.

I was invited to participate in the "One Planet" Summit on 12 December in Paris by the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, and the President of the World Bank Group, Jim Yong Kim. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this summit and I have passed on my regrets. The Government will be represented by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. While I had no discussions about the summit with those organising it, I have made clear my view that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time and the Government is fully committed to the implementation of the Paris agreement.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	The damage that was done to our country through an international study ranking us as the worst in Europe was only made worse earlier this week when we saw the latest EPA figures showing that our emissions rose by 3% in 2016. Emissions in every sector grew with no sign of anything stopping this incredible increase in pollution for which we are responsible and that is doing real damage to our country. In the Taoiseach's discussion with President Macron on 24 October last, did President Macron mention the fact that he may be setting a different example? President Macron has agreed to phase out coal power by 2022. Would we not do something similar to try to restore our reputation? President Macron is committed to doubling wind and solar power. Would we not look to do something similar? President Macron's government has set a timeline for phasing out the fossil fuel-based car fleet and has committed to do no more exploration in the Atlantic waters, which are just the same or very similar to our waters. It is reported that the Taoiseach is a keen admirer of President Macron. Would the Taoiseach not think of replicating some of those measures that would start to restore our reputation because if we keep on the way we are going, this will increasingly be a black spot on this country and we will miss out on the economic opportunities that exist from those countries that are showing a lead? When the Taoiseach talks with President Macron, does President Macron mention climate change? Do the Taoiseach and President Macron ever talk about some of the initiatives President Macron is delivering which we could imitate and restore our reputation?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	I think people and businesses are way ahead of this Government when it comes to understanding the seriousness of climate change and how we all have to act both individually and collectively. As the Taoiseach travels this evening or today, for example, if he travels along the Navan Road and through Castleknock, he will see lots of houses with solar panels on the roof and vast numbers of skips outside doors and gardens where people are re-insulating their houses. When the Taoiseach goes to Paris, rather than going as the poor relation looking for a handout of some kind, could he go with a message that the Government will actually play catch up with people and businesses in Ireland? He should look to Intel's recent announcement. We have yet to have an electric train that travels from Dublin to Cork or indeed from Dublin to Belfast. The Taoiseach has been in office for a significant period and we have heard nothing about his vision of where he hopes to make the country better. He should not be looking for handouts and concessions when he goes to Paris. Will he go with a plan that will make people in Ireland proud. While it is difficult and expensive to deal with climate change and we must find resources, will we start with electric trains and electrifying the bus fleet in Dublin instead of having filthy diesel buses driven by fabulous staff in Dublin Bus?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	Deputy Eamon Ryan has already put on the record of the House the fact that the EPA has shown this week that our emissions increased by 3.5% this year due to increased activity in dairy, energy and transport. It may have escaped national focus because of political controversy in recent days but because of that, this nation is facing fines of at least €455 million, which is an enormous sum, by 2020 and maybe up to €600 million. The year 2020 is not that far away and €600 million would gobble up a fair chunk of any available fiscal space we might have and should be devoting to other more productive uses building the capacity of this State. We are already well behind the curve. What specifically are we going to do? Are we just going to sail into a situation where we are going to buy carbon credits and face fines rather than take a really proactive line now to bring the actual greenhouse gas emissions we create in this country into line with the commitments we made openly and voluntarily to the international community?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	I agree with Deputies who spoke previously, particularly Deputies Eamon Ryan, Joan Burton and Brendan Howlin, regarding the Government's abject performance on climate change. Indeed I would trace this back to when the current Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I think Fine Gael took the position that dealing with climate change was electorally damaging, particularly in rural Ireland, and essentially jettisoned any real commitment to it. This has been manifest since then. One can see it with the recent Heritage Bill, which concerned ditches and hedges. Where did that spring from? Who were the influencers that said we needed legislation on that, which was quite significant in its destruction of biodiversity? I spoke to many farmers who really did not have an agenda to do this.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	No, we did not. The Deputy knows we amended that Bill in the Seanad. I am just making the point that in terms of the introduction of that Bill, nobody knows where it came from unless there were hidden influences behind it. The point I am trying to make is that there is an absence of vision regarding the agenda across the board in terms of renewable energy support schemes, renewable heating incentives, not meeting targets and so forth. The broader question is that hundreds of millions of euro will be lost in the coming years through fines and, as Deputy Howlin noted, the buying of carbon credits when that money could be used far more effectively in transport initiatives in particular. We will have an issue with agriculture and food if we are not careful. I believe in food security and I believe we need food production, but the transport sector is getting out of control again in terms of emissions and radical action is required in this sector to change the paradigm around our climate change policy.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	246	The EPA has warned that this State will only reach between 4% and 6% of our 2020 emissions target. As others have said, the EPA revealed that last year our greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3.5%. We are one of only four states in the EU that are still producing emissions above the 1990 levels and will also be one of the very few to miss the 20% reduction target. It has been established by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that fines could be between €1 billion and €1.5 billion.Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government is failing to take the necessary action to avoid this? Will he respond to the 13 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change? Will the Government incorporate them into Government policy? Will the Taoiseach update the Dáil on the national adoption framework which is to set out the strategy to be employed to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change? Will these proposals be available by 10 December, as promised?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	Our shocking failure to reduce CO2 emissions has been further exposed by the EPA's report. Is the Taoiseach willing to take the radical action necessary and end the special pleading for our pathetic performance? Both Deputy Bríd Smith and Deputy Eamon Ryan this week and last week submitted Bills proposing to grant no more licences for the exploration of oil and gas. If we were to do that, we would contribute significantly as a country. Deputy Bríd Smith reports from the Bonn summit that delegates were very excited about the prospect that if it happened in Ireland, like the fracking ban, it could have a huge impact internationally. If we were to make that decision, we could go from being the worst to being a leader. I have been banging on in the Dáil for the past six years about forests and trees. Our performance in afforestation is shockingly bad. It is one of the worst in Europe. We are missing all our targets. Our level of forest cover is pathetically low. The Larry Goodmans of this world and the big ranchers are to blame because they want the land for their businesses, but we need to increase the level of our forest cover. There are ways to do this that farmers would get behind if we were to support them and explain how increasing the level of forest cover on their land would benefit them financially and the environment without infringing on other things. We need to do something about Coillte's failure to plant trees.

I will have to prioritise the summit in Brussels on 14 and 15 December over going to Paris on 12 December. It would not be possible for me to attend the House to speak to Members about that crucial summit if I was to be in Paris for the two days before the summit. I will not be in Paris looking for handouts. I am happy to assure the House that that will not be the case as I will not be there. To respond to Deputy Eamon Ryan's questions about President Macron, to the best of my recollection, he did not specifically mention any of those things. We touched on climate change and also discussed the Mercosur. Ireland and France are very much aligned in their wish to protect their respective beef industries which are more carbon efficient than beef production in South America. One thing we need to make sure we will not do in trying to tackle climate change is displace production to other countries that are less carbon efficient than us.  We are examining the future role of the Moneypoint plant, our major coal-burning power plant, and also of the peat-fired stations as the PSO will run out in a number of years. As it is unlikely to be renewed, we will have to consider whether these stations can continue or whether they should be burn alternative fuels such as biomass.  The ten-year capital programme, on which we are working, will have a very strong climate change focus. It will not be enough to satisfy the Government's critics who include everyone present in the Chamber, apart from the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and I, but it will be a big step forward in terms of our response to climate change.

It is not as simple as going electric in one year or moving to natural gas or fuel cells or other fuels. We actually have to build the fuelling plants in lots of places, which raises the question of whether depots should still be where they are. It will include actions to modernise the bus fleet and move away from existing fuels. On rail electrification, it would not be practical to electrify all of the railways; it would be practical to electrify some of them. There will be investment in cycle ways and greenways in addition to what is happening. The plan will also include the capital plans for EirGrid and the ESB and their plans to bring more renewables into the system to also make the grid smart.  There will be provision for further investment in forestry above what is planned. The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has announced the renewable heat initiative which will come into effect next year. He is also very advanced in introducing new price supports for renewable energy initiatives, including solar energy, for example.

It is my view that we should increase them in the years ahead, both to discourage the production of CO2, one of the greenhouse gases that causes climate change, and also potentially as a means to raise funds to pay some of the fines. We could pay some of them by taxing the bad behaviour and bad activities that will cause the fines to arise. That is something that will have to be discussed in the context of the confidence and supply arrangement because we would not be able to do it without the facilitation of the main Opposition party.

Broughan - the need to discuss the problem of joy-riding and anti-social behaviour in Dublin Bay North; (4) Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe - the urgent need for the appointment of a full-time medical officer and the restoration of respite care services at St Patrick's Community Hospital, Fermoy, County Cork; (5) Deputy Joan Burton - concerns related to the future of cultural institutions such as concert orchestras; (6) Deputy James Lawless - to discuss decisions on the Leixlip and Celbridge local area plans; (7) Deputy Joan Collins - to ask the Minister of Children and Youth Affairs why she has not replied to the proposed solutions outlined in the child care professional group's report that was emailed to her office on 14 July and 19 October 2017; a delegation from the Inchicore child care professional group met her departmental officials on 29 March 2017 to outline the situation on the ground in lower Inchicore, Dublin 8, with regard to underprivileged vulnerable children's needs not being met; the report emailed to the Minister was a follow-up on that meeting; (8) Deputies John Lahart, Louise O'Reilly, Mattie McGrath and Jack Chambers - the cancellation of Garda overtime in the Dublin metropolitan area in the run-up to Christmas; (9) Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire - to discuss changes in the manner in which positions on community employment schemes are advertised and how applicants apply for same; (10) Deputy Brian Stanley - to discuss with the Minister recent flooding in Mountmellick and other areas of County Laois and what flood prevention measures can be put in place to alleviate the problem; (11) Deputy Pat Buckley - to discuss the need for road infrastructure investment in east Cork; (12) Deputy Clare Daly - to discuss the need to reform the pyrite remediation scheme with regard to qualifying criteria and the manner in which infill testing is being conducted; (13) Deputy Gino Kenny - the future of the rare disease technology review committee; (14) Deputy Mick Wallace - to discuss the fact that Facebook paid just €30 million in tax in Ireland on revenue of €12.6 billion last year; (15) Deputy James Browne - the need for the Minister for Health to review the criteria and practices for recruiting psychologists to HSE positions; (16) Deputy John Brassil - the need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the provision of Respreeza; (17) Deputy Billy Kelleher - the need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the "RTÉ Investigates" programme on hospital consultant practices; (18) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss under the heading of Topical Issues the role of local authorities in the delivery of maintenance works and not being reliant on the private sector; (19) Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Eamon Ryan and Barry Cowen - the death of the rough sleeper in Ranelagh and the plight of the homeless facing Christmas; and (20) Deputy Declan Breathnach - to ask the Minister for Education and Skills if he will introduce a defined timescale for all schools in the payment of minor works grants; if he is aware that delays in the payment of approved minor works grants are causing financial difficulty for schools in trying to keep their accounts in credit; the fact that the Department has stated minor works grants will be considered in the context of its overall capital position, which is unfair for schools desperately in need of the money; and if he will make a statement on the matter. The matters raised by Deputies Lisa Chambers and Aengus Ó Snodaigh, Joan Burton, Joan Collins and Declan Breathnach have been selected for discussion.

#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	Newspaper reports yesterday again raised the issue of one of the Air Corps whistleblowers who is now facing discharge from his employment. Recent events have focused the mind on the failure of the State with regard to whistleblowers and the consequences for those in charge who fail to act. I am deeply concerned that a whistleblower in the Air Corps is facing dismissal from his job for what appear to be issues directly relating to the very issue he raised with the Minister of State on which he had to blow the whistle. The charge against him is "generalised anxiety disorder and work-related industrial dispute resulting in chronic ineffectivity". I have raised this issue with the Minister of State many times and I am not satisfied with his response and his actions to date on the matter. He has not dealt effectively with the health and safety issues relating to chemicals at Casement Aerodrome that have affected the members serving there at that time. The review the Minister of State initiated produced no answers. There have been no actions to date and we are in exactly the same position today as we were when I first raised the issue in the Dáil. The Minister of State has not ordered a full health review of people affected. He has not engaged effectively with those affected. The review is quite farcical because the person tasked with the reviewing the issue told the Minister of State that he did not have the information or the capability to do what was asked. The issue stands. The individual in question has been summoned before a Defence Forces medical review board for medical issues he feels the State actually caused. His case against the State and the issue he raised with the Minister of State is that he is incredibly sick because of the failure of the State to provide him with a safe workplace. It is incredible to think that he could now be dismissed from his job because of those health issues. Given all that has gone on regarding this issue, is the Minister of State satisfied that this person has been summoned to appear before a medical review board and may lose his job over the matter? What engagements has the Minister of State had on the issue? What will he do to address the matter?

In reply the Minister of State stated:The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate of me to comment on individual personnel cases. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Defence Forces and my Department are fully committed to compliance with the requirements of the Protected Disclosures Act, 2014, and to the protections contained in that Act.The articles in the Irish Examiner yesterday and today show a clear breach of the spirit and the letter of those protected disclosures. As Deputy Lisa Chambers has outlined, the man in question appeared before a medical hearing this morning in St. Bricin's Military Hospital for the very reason he met the Minister of State - that there was something rotten in the Air Corps in terms of health and safety, as he and other whistleblowers had outlined. His medical condition and others are directly related to mass exposure to highly toxic and carcinogenic chemicals. What steps has the Minister of State taken to ensure the Defence Forces as a whole, and therefore those involved in this individual case, understand that they must fully comply with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	I thank the Deputies for raising this very important issue. I am fully committed to compliance with the requirements of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and to the protections contained in that Act. I have directed that processes are put in place to manage protected disclosures across the defence organisation, on both civil and military sides. The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces are a priority to me. To this end, I wish to ensure that all protected disclosures made by members of the Defence Forces are and continue to be dealt with in a thorough, fair and independent manner. I am assured by the Chief of Staff that the military authorities are fully aware of the protections afforded to their members under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. In order to ensure compliance with this legislation the Defence Forces have implemented general routine order 07/2015, which sets out the policy, procedures and protections afforded to serving personnel on making a protected disclosure. The document was signed and promulgated on 21 August 2015. The Defence Forces are committed to the highest possible standards of compliance with our legal requirements. Their protected disclosures policy is intended to encourage and enable members of the Defence Forces to raise concerns about relevant wrongdoing in the organisation. The Defence Forces are committed to ensuring that members making a disclosure under the Act will be protected from penalisation or threat of less favourable treatment, subsequent discrimination or disadvantage. The Defence Forces protected disclosures policy gives effect to the obligations and provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and does not replace any legal reporting or disclosure requirements arising under other legislation. The Defence Forces remain cognisant of the requirement to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all members. The Defence Forces policy on protected disclosures is intended to cover all aspects of Defence Forces activity including operations outside of Ireland. Regarding the matter raised by the Deputies, life within the Defence Forces, particularly at operational level, can be physically robust and challenging. To ensure that the health and safety of individuals and those of his or her colleagues are safeguarded, the monitoring of medical status is an important safeguard in military life. Defence Forces regulation A12 provides the regulatory framework for medical treatment in the Defence Forces. These regulations provide for the convening of a medical board in specific circumstances. This can lead to a range of outcomes, including individuals being classed as below Defence Forces medical standards. It is important to note that this is not a disciplinary procedure and among other things it provides a mechanism for appropriately managing cases of long-term sick leave. Issues of confidentiality are of the utmost importance in dealing with matters such as those raised in this Topical Issue. Individuals are entitled to confidentiality regarding their personnel dealings with their employer, their medical dealings and in other areas such as litigation and protected disclosures. Accordingly, I am severely constrained in what I can say here today. While I cannot discuss medical and other personal details of an individual, I can inform the Deputies that in the case referred to, my overarching concern is that the individual’s rights under protected disclosure legislation are fully protected. I have previously written to the Chief of Staff in this regard, highlighting the requirements for full compliance with protected disclosure legislation. I have recently written to the Chief of Staff restating my position that the individual concerned is afforded the full protection of the Protected Disclosure Act. I have made clear that no action should be taken that would impinge on his rights in accordance with protected disclosure legislation. I assure the Deputies that, if required, I will take whatever actions are available to me in order to ensure that all individuals who make protected disclosures receive the protection of that legislation.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	The Minister of State has said he was constrained by litigation that was ongoing, but this issue is all over the Irish Examiner newspaper. Mr. Joe Logue reports on it on a regular basis and we all know what has been going on. We may as well discuss it in this House where it is appropriate to do so. I accept that the Minister of State has said he is complying fully with the protected disclosures legislation, but, on a human level, the issue concerns an individual whom both he and I have met and who is very ill. However, he is not the only person who is ill. Many others have been affected, some of whom are now deceased. The allegations made against the State are very serious. They are that it caused them to become ill owing to the lack of health and safety standards and exposure to dangerous and hazardous chemicals, from which they were not protected. The very fact that somebody is ill because of the place in which they work and that they are now being dismissed from their employment by their employer - the State - because of that illness is utterly and morally wrong. The Minister of State said that he will take whatever actions are open to him. What actions are open to him? What about conducting a health review? Why is he not reviewing the health of the people concerned to identify who has been affected? Why wait for a very lengthy litigation process to conclude before acting? The Minister of State has the ability to do so now. I believe he is not doing enough on the issue which we will continue to raise in the House.

He has also said he will act. We will hold him to that commitment in the event that there is further penalisation of the whistleblower in this instance because the person concerned is not the only one who has faced disciplinary procedures or suffered at the hands of officers who seem to be of the same view as a former Garda Commissioner that whistleblowers are disgraceful. That attitude which is held by some within the Defence Forces will have to change, but such a culture has not been changed fully. The Minister of State is right in saying the environment in the Defence Forces is robust and challenging, but that does not excuse the bullying, victimisation or targeting of whistleblowers who have made claims to the benefit of everyone within the Defence Forces. I hope we will not be back here again if the Minister of State takes the required action, if action is needed.

I have set out that I have been in contact with the Chief of Staff in that regard. Some of the issues raised are personal to an individual, while some are linked with other issues that are the subject of litigation. It would be wholly inappropriate, therefore, for me to comment further on the detail of the case. As a process of litigation had commenced before the protected disclosures were made, the courts are the appropriate forum in which to consider such matters. However, the independent reviewer's report on the protected disclosures made in the Air Corps has been provided for the three individuals who made the disclosures. I asked those who had made the disclosures for their views on the report, which I have recently received from the three individuals concerned. As I have stated, I will consider the next steps to be taken, taking into account the views provided for me by the three individuals in question. Separately and in parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to improve the health, safety and well-being of its members. It should be noted that there is a significant overlap between the HSA's recommendations and those of the independent reviewer. I have been advised that, subject to completion of improvements - the HSA's investigation has been closed - it must be noted that health and safety in the Air Corps are subject to ongoing monitoring and supervision. The health, safety and well-being of each member of the Defence Forces are of great concern. If required, I will take whatever action is necessary and open to me to ensure all individuals who make protected disclosures will receive the protection provided by the legislation.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	I had not heard that the Minister was not going to appear in the Chamber. I am disappointed that she is not present as she is the Minister with responsibility for culture and this matter was very much directed at her. I will wait to hear what the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, has to say on her behalf, but this is most unsatisfactory. With no disrespect to him, had I been advised of this information, I would not have accepted this arrangement. I wish to ask Deputy Heather Humphreys as the Minister with responsibility for culture whether she agrees that orchestras, in particular, the two RTÉ orchestras, the national symphony and concert orchestras which were founded in 1948, are an intrinsic part of our culture? Does she agree that music is an intrinsic part of our culture? It is something for which we are known and celebrated throughout the world, yet we seem to be on a slow march towards reducing the numbers of employees working with the orchestras and possibly doing away with one of them entirely. The Minister has not come into the House to take this matter, but I want to ask her as the Minister with responsibility for culture and a successor to a former Minister, Michael D. Higgins, now President, who established the first Department of Culture, what her vision or fís is for orchestras in the playing of music in this country? Are we on the road to almost having a plot that one might see in an opera in which music, particularly classical and orchestral music in RTÉ, will be killed in a death by a thousand cuts? Already RTÉ is 30 professional musicians short and by next year, it may be 40 short.  I am not aware that in its history Fine Gael has been particularly committed to culture, but this is shocking. When Creative Ireland was established during the centenary commemorations, as the then Tánaiste, I strongly supported widening the investment in culture to rebuild the national cultural institutions, including the National Concert Hall, yet we have an important short debate taking place on the matter today and the Fine Gael-led Government has not been able to send the Minister into the House to take it.

I have been asked to take it on her behalf.  Our colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has statutory responsibility for broadcasting and his remit includes RTÉ. The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphrey's Department has no role in that regard. She understands RTÉ is an independent public service broadcaster which was established under the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 114 of the Act sets out the objects of RTÉ which include the objective "to establish and maintain orchestras, choirs and other cultural performing groups". Section 98 of the Act establishes the independence of RTÉ in pursuance of its objects.The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and his officials have certain responsibilities in respect of RTÉ, particularly regarding a range of policy and governance issues. It is understood the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra provide the only full-time salaried employment for orchestral musicians in Ireland. In line with a model found in over 30 European countries, both orchestras have been part of the public broadcasting company since their foundation by RTÉ in the 1940s. As a result, they reach large national and international broadcast audiences, in addition to their live event audiences for large year-round programmes. Both RTÉ orchestras are funded by RTÉ as part of its public service remit. The Arts Council which comes within the remit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht provides funding for two smaller and regularly performing orchestras - the Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish Baroque Orchestra - which are occasionally supported through Culture Ireland for their work abroad. The Irish Chamber Orchestra which retains 22 musicians on part-time retainer contracts specialises in classical music written for small string chamber orchestras. The Irish Baroque Orchestra which has a core of 12 to 16 uncontracted project-based freelance players is a specialist orchestra that plays predominantly 17th and 18th century classical music exclusively on historical period instruments. Both of these smaller orchestras have lower levels of public activity than the two full-time RTÉ orchestras. In 2017 the Arts Council allocated funding of €916,000 to the Irish Chamber Orchestra, while an allocation of €208,000 was made to the Irish Baroque Orchestra. The three other professional performing groups supported by Arts Council funding are the Crash Ensemble, Chamber Choir Ireland and the Contempo Quartet. All three groups receive occasional project-funding support from Culture Ireland for performances abroad. In addition to the two orchestras and the three regularly funded groups, a large and varying number of established and ad hoc professional groups access non-recurring public funding through Arts Council funding programmes to support them in touring, commissions of new work, one-off music projects and fixed-term residencies.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	Having listened to the poor Minister of State who was asked to deliver that script, I know why the senior Minister did not come in. It is a disgrace. We are proud of our culture in this country. It is an insult to the musicians who work in the two orchestras that the Minister responsible for culture was unable to grace this Chamber for the debate. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, when I say that. At least he had the courage to be here. He was certainly handed a patsy to read. Will the Government apologise to musicians? Will it apologise to the large numbers of young people who are studying music to degree level with a view to becoming professional musicians? Where is their employment going to be if we are working systematically to downgrade the number of people who work with the RTÉ orchestras, possibly with a view to axing one of them entirely? Music lovers and the members of the Musicians Union of Ireland and SIPTU want to see the orchestras restored to their full status. We want to see a thriving culture of music learning and appreciation in schools and at degree level in universities. We probably have the smallest orchestra provision of any small European country. Our orchestras are based in RTÉ because the custom when they were founded in 1948 was to have radio orchestras that broadcast to people around the country in order that they could enjoy classical music. The Minister of State was part of the discussions when Topical Issue debates were introduced. One of the reforms promised by the Government at the time was that the relevant Minister would appear. If he or she could not appear, which can happen, an apology would be provided as part of the discussion with the Deputy who placed the Topical Issue. We were told that it would be possible, with the agreement of the Chair, for the Deputy in question to refuse to proceed with the Topical Issue on the day and ask to raise it with the Minister in the Chamber on another day. Will the Minister of State ask the senior Minister to reschedule this debate in order that we can be given some answers as part of a response in favour of the retention of the orchestras?

I have received an email from Ms Aoife Hannan, the project manager with the Kilmainham Inchicore Network. It was sent on behalf of the child care professional group in Inchicore. The Minister has received a professional report that has been drawn up since February 2016. She knows what is contained in the report which was pulled together by representatives of primary schools, secondary school principals, child care and preschool services, the Garda, youth workers and community, social and psychological services in the area. Those who started to work on the report in February 2016 met officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in March this year. They emailed the first version of the report to the Department on 14 July, but they did not receive a reply. They subsequently emailed it again on 19 October. I ask the Minister to confirm that she has received the report and that she will reply to it. I am aware that those involved in producing the report were emailed by a member of staff in the Department this morning. They were told that the departmental response was ready and would issue shortly. That response is welcome and the individuals in question are delighted with it. The Minister will agree that the report, which is a review of evidence-based local and national statistical data, paints a picture of the underlying demographic conditions in lower Inchicore and highlights the level of disadvantage in the area. It goes through the levels of child poverty, male and female unemployment, deprivation, lone parents and homeless children, Pobal reports, population increases, etc., all of which it breaks down into categories.It depicts the disadvantaged situation in that area and the dire need for solutions to be put in place in the community. Section 2 discusses how a comparative study with other areas would help explain conditions and needs in the area and section 3 outlines the loss of services which has occurred in the area. Case studies to humanise the situation as experienced on the ground were outlined at the meeting with the Minister's officials on 29 March. Section 4 gives a review and solutions are offered in section 5. The last section is a brief summary and outlines the conclusions of the report. I would like to hear the Minister's reply to this. The group has asked me to extend an invitation to her to come into the community in response to the report so that she can actually see the area, get a feel for it and meet the different organisations involved in pulling this together.

I can confirm that officials from my Department met with representatives from the Inchicore child care professional group earlier this year, as the Deputy mentioned. As the Deputy has outlined, at this meeting the group submitted a report on a wide range of issues which it felt were having a negative impact on the lives of children and young people in the Inchicore area. These ranged from the funding of youth initiatives to the sustainability of child care services. Many of the issues raised are those that I have been seeking to address during my time as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I commend the group on a comprehensive report and assure it that my Department has been working hard to address the issues raised within it. One issue that struck a chord during the group's meeting with officials was the fact that parents from lower income families could often not afford to pay the difference between the subvention available to cover the cost of child care and the cost of delivering child care or the fee charged. This had led to a situation in which the sustainability of community-based services in the area was threatened. It also led to an unfortunate situation in which the service had to chase parents for top-up payments which they could sometimes ill afford. That is deeply distressing. To address this problem I have recently increased the amount of subvention available to many of these families by as much as 50%. Subsidies per week per child have now increased from as much as €95 per week to €145 per week. Some 34,000 children across the country are now registered for subsidies such as this. To improve the sustainability of services, I have also recently announced an increase of 7% in the capitation my Department pays for the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme. This will come into effect next September. This will deliver extra income to child care services for the 114,000 children expected to participate in ECCE from that time. I have also introduced a universal, non-means tested child care subsidy scheme for children under three. This reduces the cost of child care for parents by over €1,000 per year per child. In addition, in recognition of the administrative role which child care services play in delivering Department of Children and Youth Affairs schemes, especially services such as those in Inchicore which deliver targeted schemes, I have made available €18 million in funding in 2017 as payment to the services for supporting these programmes. This funding has also been secured for 2018 onwards. I recently announced an additional €2.12 million of funding for family resource centres. Up to €10,000 is being made available to each of the existing 109 family resource centres. In total, €16.37 million will be invested next year by Tusla in its family resource centre programme, an increase of 21% on 2017. Extra funding of €1.5 million to support the provision of youth services throughout the country has also just been announced. This brings overall investment in both national and local youth work services to €58.9 million. While these changes may not fully restore funding to its peak they represent a hard fought step in the right direction. It is not always possible to restore specific projects that have ended but by leveraging additional funding into the areas of child care, family resource centres and youth work we are helping to strengthen the key services which the Deputy's group has identified as struggling from cuts made during times of austerity. I have fought hard to increase investment in these areas. Investment in child care, for example, is up 87% in three years. I know that much more needs to be done to get to where we want to be, and I look forward to working with the Deputy and hearing her suggestions in that regard.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	I thank the Minister. The case the group is making is that there is a particular need within the lower Inchicore area, where there is quite considerable deprivation. It is suggesting that the Minister target specific initiatives which would assist the community in the area. The level of child poverty in Our Lady of Lourdes national school is 22%. The rate in Dublin generally is 6.6%. We are talking about a community where the child poverty rate is 16 percentage points above the Dublin average. The unemployment rate is 38% in that area while the national average is 7.1%, so we are talking about a community in which the unemployment rate is 31 percentage points higher than the national average. The level of male unemployment is 30.4% in the Myra Close and Turvey Avenue area, 22 percentage points above the national average. The report makes points about child poverty in the area of St. Michael's Estate specifically, an area which is suffering severe deprivation. Surely there are initiatives which could be looked at. The group wants to sit down and talk to the Minister about such initiatives. It understands that money has come through. The Minister has made many points about the increases she has managed to get in other areas. This area also has the highest density of DEIS schools. The need for DEIS schools and the need to provide more supports for children is recognised in the community. If this generational poverty continues, it will cause more hardship, more drug problems and more chaos in the community, and there is a lot of chaos in the community already. We can do an awful lot more to redirect resources to this area. The group is talking about money, but not just money. It is also looking at other areas which could support the community. It would be very good if the Minister could link in with the group at some stage.

She represents the concerns and interests of her people very well. It is important that she is able to do that and I hear the concerns. Over the course of the years I have been working, I have had the opportunity to go to Inchicore and to meet some of the people there. I have come into contact with some of the real challenges which the Deputy has identified but I have also come into contact with the extraordinary group of professionals there and seen the community spirit and the resilience of both the people living there and those working there. I commend them on that resilience and spirit. I mean that. It has inspired a lot of my own work in other settings. The report which the Deputy has provided to myself and the officials, which was prepared by a range of professionals in the area who worked together to put forward their case, is really important. Ultimately, the only way an area can change, particularly in respect of the primary issues which the Deputy identified towards the end of her contribution, and the only way it can challenge, reduce, shift and change generational poverty, is for all the different groups to work together. I have some understanding of how challenging that is. The fact that they have come together in this regard is very impressive. The Deputy described the level of disadvantage in terms of child poverty. She is probably aware that, as part of a cross-Government approach, we have tried to identify new ways to work on this very challenging social issue. We have come to the conclusion that a lot of it is about investing in services as well as increasing opportunities for the employment of parents. I have told the Deputy about many of the different ways in which I have made additional investment in services throughout the short tenure of my ministry. At the same time, I have given her national figures. The Deputy is looking at her constituency. She has asked me to come and see the area and I will do so.

Is he aware that delays in the payment of approved minor works grants are causing huge financial difficulty for schools that are trying to keep their accounts in credit and that the Department has said that such grants will be considered in the context of the Department's overall capitation position, which is unfair for schools desperately in need of these moneys? I am all too aware of these problems as I was a teacher for 35 years, 23 of which were spent as a teaching principal in a small primary school that struggled every year, regardless of who was in Government. Circular 62/2013 states that the grant will only be paid in future years as funding permits. However, the grant first came into operation in 1997 and has been issued in all years since then with the exception of the 2012-13 school year. Schools rely on the grant as part of their operational income as there is always a need for funds to cover the type of works covered by the scheme. The Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Rourke, discussed this matter with me on many occasions in regard to the issue of playgrounds in his constituency not being available to be used because of delays in minor works grants. If we are serious about health and safety as well as improving children's physical health, surely this issue needs to be addressed and we need to ensure it is on a firm footing. The principals of schools in my constituency are under a lot of stress trying to balance the books as schools are not permitted to go into overdraft except in exceptional circumstances. They have told me that the minor works grant has not yet issued this year. In answer to a parliamentary question I tabled earlier this year, the Minister said that the overall 2017 capital position, and expenditure levels in particular, would be assessed in the late autumn and that the issue of the 2017-18 minor works grant would be determined at that time. One of the principals to whom I have spoken said that she, along with a huge number of her colleagues around the country, is absolutely outraged to be back in this position. There has been much engagement on the topic on the website of the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN. There is no point issuing IT grants, for example, if principals cannot keep the school running on a day-to-day basis. The minor works grant should be mandatory rather than dependent on money left over at the end of a calendar year. The schools in question are depending on the grant arriving in November. Their principals are fearful that the schools will not otherwise get to January, when the first of the capitation grant money arrives, without applying for an overdraft. This can be extremely stressful for staff. Many schools are reliant on parents' committees constantly running fundraisers to get them through, along with the minor works grant.  The Capital Review 2016-20 states in regard to the minor works grant to primary schools: "It is not possible to maintain the school infrastructure without the payment of the minor works grant and an annual summer works scheme.” Primary schools are the Cinderella of the Department's funding regime and I ask the Minister to address the issue.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23635	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and I know it is of significant concern. I have to put my cards on the table because we are working to very constrained capital budgets and have been through a period of very rapid population growth, which is very good fortune for us in one sense. We have to provide approximately 12,000 to 15,000 new places and 5,000 replacement places every year. Those demands are putting the Department to the pin of its collar to ensure there are places for children when they turn up in September. This year, the Department will deliver almost 14,000 new places and 5,000 additional replacement places That has to be prioritised, which has put a squeeze on some other funding areas, as the Deputy will understand, such as emergency grants, summer works and minor works. The Deputy made the point that it would be great if the minor works grant were mandatory but I have to live within the capital framework provided and the Deputy knows the background to that. Over the past eight years, the overall capital programme has been cut to one third of what it was at its peak. We are living in a very financially constrained period. Although I acknowledge the minor works grant is an important element of funding, we are continuing to review our work programme both this year and next in terms of meeting the demands of the new schools we have to build and places we have to provide. Since 2011, we have provided 120,000 new school places and 200 new schools, and that is being done in accordance with a very strict system whereby it is only when an area can show a shortage of school places that we commit to build, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Rourke, knows. That is a constraining factor. We are continuing to review our funding position but I cannot give a commitment as to when we will be in a position to make a decision on the issue. I am very conscious of the concern expressed by the Deputy and many others on all sides of the House. I am working with the Department to seek a solution.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	I thank the Minister and acknowledge the constraints under which he is working. Will there be a minor works grant for schools before Christmas? The principals and boards of management need to know that because otherwise they need to look elsewhere for funds. As we head into December, schools need to have enough money to pay insurance, heating bills, ancillary staff, electricity, fire alarms and so on. They are unsuccessfully trying to manage on a shoestring. To have to jump from one grant to another, never quite sure when the next one might land in the bank account, if, from what the Minister is saying, it happens at all, is no way of running finances. I ask that the Minister seek to guarantee that the yearly minor works grant would be made mandatory and end the practice of making this essential funding dependent on leftover capital that may be available in the Department. Furthermore, the Department needs to carry out an audit of what it costs boards of management to run their schools and provide a realistic level of funding for minor works grants and capitation grants. The use of the word "grant" should be removed because this funding, as I said, should be mandatory and is part of the necessary expenditure for running a school. Will a grant for minor works be issued before Christmas or is the Minister fearful it will not? If the answer is in the negative, schools need to be informed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23635	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	I regret that I am currently not in a position to answer the Deputy on that issue. I understand he is saying this should be the top priority in the capital budget but if children had no school to attend next September, the Deputy would be clamouring about hopeless planning such that the Department cannot use its capital in order to ensure every child has a school place. We are trying to balance all those conflicting pressures. It is often the situation that there are more schools in the pipeline waiting for the go-ahead than there is funding available and we have to manage our funding to meet those demands. That is the constraint under which we are working. As regards capital spending, both this and the former Government led by Fianna Fáil sought to protect our education system as much as possible and that continues to be the case. As the Deputy knows, we have made commitments regarding an increased pupil-teacher ratio, guidance counsellors, the resource teaching model and SNAs. We have sought to meet those very immediate children's needs.It is a balancing act, but all I can say to the Deputy is that I am very aware of the concern he expresses. I will work with my Department to see whether we can resolve the issue.

Braitheann sé ar cé a thagann in am. I will take approximately eight minutes. It has been clear in recent days that the Department of Justice and Equality has quite serious and fundamental problems, a point that has, I think, been acknowledged by Government spokespersons. There have long been concerns about the Department. This is the reason the Toland report was first commissioned. What the Toland report found was a "secretive and closed" Department, so much so that secrecy was "part of its DNA". It had "significant leadership and management problems", and Mr. Toland recommended "fundamental and sustained organisational and cultural change". The quite shocking revelations of recent weeks underline this even further. They led to the resignation of the former Tánaiste, which was caused in substantial part by a Taoiseach trying to brazen out a controversy despite clear wrongdoing and despite his having knowledge of the later emails since Friday, as, apparently, did Deputy Micheál Martin. If the latter had intended to allow a fudge, permitting the former Tánaiste to remain in place right up until the public outcry on Monday night, this raises questions about his judgment. In general, serious questions have been raised about the culture in the Department, particularly in the context of how the documents at the heart of this controversy were not found earlier and sent to the Charleton tribunal. Yesterday evening, we attempted to bring forward a motion which outlined very specific changes. The motion was ruled out of order for procedural reasons - unfairly, in our view. We have therefore brought forward a motion which calls on the Government to amend the current terms of reference to include explicitly a number of matters. The proposals we brought forward would have explicitly included the Minister for Justice and Equality and Department officials. In order that people understand what changes we feel are required and why they are required, I circulated to all Members early this afternoon a copy of draft changes I will propose. If any Member does not have this, I can arrange for him or her to receive it. These changes would do a number of things. First, they would allow the commission to investigate what knowledge officials, advisers and Ministers in the Department of Justice and Equality had of the issues under discussion at the tribunal. The current terms only allow for investigation of the knowledge of the former Commissioners, Mr. Callinan and Ms O'Sullivan, which is a significant shortfall and a significant difference. Second, the changes would make explicit that contacts with the Department of Justice and Equality fall within the scope of the tribunal. Quite substantially, and crucially, the changes also include a new term of reference relating to the possibility of a cover-up, suppression or a deliberate failure to disclose central documents on the part of the Department, the Garda and the Attorney General's office, as per recent revelations. This is an issue of the greatest seriousness and one which was not truly anticipated by the Government at the time of the drafting of the terms of reference. However, it is central to the current controversy because the Minister's explanations for the late discovery of these documents are simply not credible. Likewise, the Minister's explanation for not reading the email on 13 November, when he was informed by telephone of it, is not credible. He says he did not read the email until the same date as the Taoiseach read it. He felt no need to ask further questions as to what the email contained regarding the nature of the legal dispute referenced at the O'Higgins commission, yet he allowed a press release to be issued on the following day which stated:It was solely a matter for the parties to the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation to decide what legal approach to take to the work of the Commission, taking into account the legal advice available to them. In the circumstances, the Department of Justice and Equality would have had no role in determining the approach ... taken by the Garda Commissioner to the Commission in question.There is a clear reference here to what was a legal strategy and the subject of the email referenced in the phone call. How could the Minister not join the dots? How did he feel he could make a public comment on the legal approach taken by the former Commissioner yet not check any further when he got a call stating that he had received an email on the same subject? I return to the specific issue I raised with the Minister yesterday. He confirmed that these documents are new and that they were never considered for either the Iarfhlaith O'Neill scoping exercise or the discovery order for the Charleton tribunal. These searches showed up something of the order of 230 documents for the tribunal. I ask again, how is it possible that, in the context of a scoping exercise or a discovery order, emails from the key officials and political staff within the Department, including the former Minister herself, were not considered? Is it the case that these email accounts were not checked? How is it possible they did not show up in searches, given where they were located? It is beyond extraordinary. Email searches are not especially complicated procedures. The Minister needs to find out and answer whether these email accounts were searched and, if not, why not. Furthermore, there are enough questions there to warrant another question being asked: was there a cover-up, a suppression of information or a deliberate failure to disclose documents? The tribunal needs to consider that matter. The Taoiseach has initiated a so-called external review. For a start, we believe that review should be carried out by someone outside the Civil Service. However, we also believe this is likely to be a private affair and largely a procedural initiative and unlikely to probe underlying intent, which is crucial. What caused these emails not to be discovered? An exploration of this question, heard in public, would be an important step in getting to the truth and restoring public confidence. I believe this question arises in the minds of many, and the only way for the Minister to have it proved or disproved is through the tribunal. As I said, this was not considered at the time and it is essential to have it probed now. I will quote what I believe is a very pointed, well-argued piece by Fintan O'Toole published in The Irish Times yesterday. It states:[I]n any case, it is highly implausible that the only documents missed in the trawl in February happen to be the ones that are most relevant to the tribunal's task of investigating contacts between the Garda and members of the Government on the alleged smearing of Maurice McCabe ... the department handed over fewer than 300 documents to the tribunal. This is by no means a massive cache - the explanation that the explosive emails were needles lost in a giant haystack simply doesn’t wash.The suspicion of deliberation is, moreover, enhanced by subsequent events: the refusal to answer Alan Kelly's questions in the Dáil, Frances Fitzgerald's now discredited claim to have had no knowledge of the Garda strategy to attack McCabe, Charlie Flanagan's extraordinary reluctance to tell his own Taoiseach that he was misleading the Dáil when he insisted that Fitzgerald knew nothing of the whole affair until it eventually became public.Unless we hear a very good explanation, we have to assume that the withholding of the emails was deliberate. And this is an extremely serious business. If Katie Hannon had not revealed the existence of the first email last week, it seems likely that the Charleton tribunal would have proceeded on the basis of radically incomplete information - an abuse, as the judge said, of public resources, but also a defiance of the democratic will of the people as expressed by unanimous votes in both houses of the Oireachtas.This makes the case quite clearly, and it is indeed a very serious business. It is in fact a criminal offence under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979. In addition, if it is the case that the Charleton tribunal was hobbled by this, we now also need to find out how this happened and if someone deliberately failed to hand over these documents. The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government have said they do not fear the truth. Given the Government and the Taoiseach's commitment to transparency on this issue in recent days, as well as a similar commitment from Fianna Fáil, I hope they will support this logical step. The existing terms of reference are clearly not adequate to explore this matter. The seriousness of the potentially deliberate suppression or withholding of documents is that serious that it requires discussion via the tribunal in public, and that is a change we need to make in this House.

They have exposed a rotten system whereby attempts were made, apparently at the highest level, to smear as a sex abuser a man who had the courage to expose huge wrongdoings within An Garda Síochána. The strategy employed against Detective Sergeant Maurice McCabe is one in which officials of the Department of Justice and Equality and the former Tánaiste and Minister in that Department, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, despite their protestations, were complicit, either by their silence, negligence or, at best, incompetence. Those who continued to back the former Garda Commissioner, despite being aware of the strategy being deployed against Detective Sergeant McCabe, have serious questions to answer. So much of what we have been told is simply not credible and many questions remain unanswered. How was it that following two substantial trawls for relevant documentation, for the purposes of the O'Neill inquiry and the Charleton tribunal, respectively, these damning emails were missed? How could that have happened? Were they viewed as not being relevant? What else has yet to be discovered? Given the supportive relationship between the former Minister and senior Department officials, on the one hand, and the former Garda Commissioner and her senior staff and colleagues, on the other, has the so-called trawl included a search of other than their official lines of communication? Is there any other avenue of address that has yet to be employed in order to ensure we have a comprehensive picture? While I cannot confirm the authenticity of the claim, it seems an email was sent from an official in the Department of Justice and Equality to the then assistant commissioner, John Twomey, in September 2015. That email included a noteworthy sentence. I wonder if this is one of the 230 items to which the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, referred in last night's address. The email apparently contains the following sentence, "Same shit happening again, Wilson, Harrison and McCabe." It is important to establish the veracity of that document. We are advised that it is indeed a quotation from an email which issued from the Department. I would like to have that confirmed or denied vehemently, hoping the latter is the case. It is hard to fathom that having taken a call on 13 November regarding these emails, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, did not read them until a week later, 20 November. Having listened carefully to what he said last evening, surely he must accept that so much of this simply does not add up. I could go on but there is not the time to do so. I conclude by highlighting my concern at the decision of the Secretary General to bring forward his resignation with immediate effect yesterday, when the original tendering of his intention to resign indicated he would remain in position until February 2018. He had been summoned to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality this day week to discuss these matters. The Minister is not available because of other business and the former Tánaiste is perhaps not in a position to attend either. As Chairman of the committee, I wish to register my concern about this. It is clear that a revision of the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and certain other matters is now required. The motion before the House is deserving of unanimous support.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	I was justice spokesperson for my party when the original terms of reference relating to the disclosures tribunal were being drafted. The former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, met all interested parties at the time to discuss those terms. One of the recommendations that was suggested by us and by several other groups was that the Department should be specifically named in the terms. We were told, however, that the phrase "other State entities" would cover that. Things have moved on a great deal since those terms were drafted and we are in a completely different landscape. We now know, for example, that critical emails which go to the very heart of what Mr. Justice Peter Charleton was examining were withheld for some reason or were not discovered. If they were not found, then there are questions as to how deep was the trawl that took place on two previous occasions, the first being the scoping exercise for Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill's inquiry and the second being the discovery order for the tribunal itself. It is astonishing that despite the emails we are discussing not being discovered in the course of those two investigative processes, they were found within a couple of days of parliamentary questions being tabled. To be clear, the emails in question were found in a matter of days after the Taoiseach ordered a deep trawl of all correspondence that could be relevant, yet they were not discovered in the course of two previous exercises, one of which was a discovery order made by a tribunal. There are questions to be answered in that regard. Moreover, I am not 100% certain at this stage that all relevant documentation has been found, because I do not know how deep the trawl which took place last week went. We know it went far enough to find a number of emails that were "new", as the Minister classed them yesterday. To clarify, it was not the case that these emails had been considered but it was decided they should not be handed over to the Charleton tribunal. This was new information being presented by the Department. The Taoiseach has undertaken to implement an external review of these matters, to be carried out by the Secretary General of his own Department. We have raised some concerns in this regard. In fairness to the Taoiseach and the Minister, they indicated yesterday that they are open to Members of this House nominating or recommending a person outside the Civil Service. I certainly hope we can come to an arrangement whereby an external person is tasked with overseeing the review, rather than a person from within the Department of the Taoiseach or any other Department, or, indeed, a civil servant. Events have moved rapidly in recent days and there is a perception that the documents we are discussing were withheld intentionally. If that is the case, then a criminal offence took place. In order for justice to be done and be seen to be done, these matters must be addressed in public by the tribunal. The only way that can be done is by revisiting its terms of reference. I encourage the Minister to ensure that there are no further documents, emails or other correspondence within the Department that are of relevance to the investigation. I suggest, in addition, that a similar deep trawl be conducted within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, particularly in light of the fact that some of the allegations levelled at Detective Sergeant McCabe involved Tusla, which comes under the remit of that Department.That also needs to be considered by the Government. We need to go beyond the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure that all relevant information is being presented. We are speaking in a bit of a vacuum because we do not know what the Minister's response will be to the proposals to extend the terms of reference. I hope the Minister is open to this and I hope he will sit down with the justice spokespersons to try to accommodate that. I await the Minister's response on that.

I remind the House of my statement last evening wherein I explained that responding to parliamentary questions about issues that, prima facie, fall under the tribunal's terms of reference arose would, from my understanding, amount to a breach of the Standing Orders of the Dáil, improperly encroach on the workings and proper functioning of the tribunal and amount to a parallel process, thereby having the effect of undermining the tribunal. As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, I have sought the counsel of his office in respect of how this House might go forward in addressing parliamentary questions of this nature. I look forward to hearing from the Ceann Comhairle about this. It is absolutely essential that we, as parliamentarians, whether as members of the Government or the Opposition, all know and are informed of the parameters within which these issues can be discussed, having regard to the fact that there is a tribunal of inquiry which was agreed by a resolution of the House and which has commenced its work. The tribunal has been engaged and charged with the type of activity that is the subject matter of debate in the House. I look forward to hearing from the Ceann Comhairle in respect of this matter. We are all aware that the tribunal has been sitting in private session recently because it is engaged in a scoping exercise regarding term of reference [p], which addresses the matter of the targeting or discrediting of any garda who has made a protected disclosure prior to 16 February 2017. As a result of the fact that the tribunal has not been holding public hearings, I am of the view that Members may perhaps have overlooked its very comprehensive terms of reference. Many Members made important contributions and worked closely with my predecessor in ultimately agreeing terms of reference that were acceptable to all. My view, confirmed by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General earlier today, is that the tribunal already has the discretion to examine the matters put forward in the motion before us. For that reason, the Government has decided to oppose the motion. I shall elaborate further on the advice provided to me. I refer to the terms of reference [e] and [h]. My advice is that the combined effect of these terms could be viewed as encompassing examination of any communications between the Department of Justice and Equality, Ministers for Justice and Equality past and present, the Attorney General's office and An Garda Síochána regarding "legal strategy". Furthermore, regard should already be had to the current term of reference [e] which provides that the tribunal is required:To investigate whether the false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds were inappropriately relied upon by Commissioner O’Sullivan to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe at the Commission of Investigation into Certain Matters in the Cavan/Monaghan district under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kevin O’Higgins.Term of reference [h] states:To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and:— Media and broadcasting personnel,— members of the Government,— TUSLA,— Health Service Executive,— any other State entities,— or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work;relevant to the matters set out in [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above.Clearly, this includes all and any Departments, appropriate agencies or State entities. I am sure that Members have copies of the terms of reference before them in the context of this debate. I am satisfied, therefore, that the terms of reference which this House formulated and agreed, provide a wide discretion to the tribunal. It is my priority, and that of the Government, to let Judge Charleton get on with his critical work. I urge Members to go back and read the record of the debate in House on 16 February 2017, when we agreed the terms of reference. On that day, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - who has just left the Chamber - stated:Yesterday, we met with the Minister and brought to her seven separate proposals in terms of the changes we would like to see made. I am glad to say that six of those proposals have been taken on board in some capacity.Deputy Brendan Howlin stated:I thank the Tánaiste for meeting me yesterday and for producing terms of reference which I believe encompass the issues I have raised. I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well. I hope his ambition to complete his work within the reasonable timeframe he has set out becomes a reality.Deputy Jim O’Callaghan stated:I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well in the task he has to do. He should be given the opportunity to do it without background noise from politicians or from the parties affected by the tribunal. Ultimately, we will have a report, and I believe the report will be to the benefit of Irish society.I agree wholeheartedly with all of these comments. I have just highlighted some aspects of the long debate but they show a widespread endorsement of the House for the terms of reference as set. The reason the Opposition gave such a welcome to the terms of reference was because they recognised their comprehensive nature and the wide discretion afforded to the sole member, namely, Judge Charleton. I repeat the importance of allowing him get on with his critical work in the context of the issues raised. On Friday last, the tribunal issued a public notice stating that:The tribunal is mindful that the instrument setting up this process, pursuant to resolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, noted that "a public enquiry is the most appropriate way to investigate" the matters of "public disquiet" at issue in the terms of reference.The tribunal, mindful that it is required "to inquire urgently into" the issues before it pursuant to the mandate of the Oireachtas as "definite matters of urgent public importance" ... [and noted that] The tribunal will sit from Monday 8 January 2018 in relation to terms of reference (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m).In other words, the tribunal will inquire into issues relating to the O’Higgins commission and related issues. The public notice also indicates that the tribunal will inquire into:... the allegations of Superintendent David Taylor as to alleged negative briefing against Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the knowledge, if any, Commissioner Callinan and Commissioner O’Sullivan, both now no longer in office, had of same, and whether Sergeant McCabe was subject to any attempt to "entrap or falsely accuse" him of "criminal misconduct". Necessarily included are telecommunications interactions, electronic and paper files bearing on same and any meeting relevant, including, but not limited to, that in Bewley's Hotel on 24 January 2014. A central part of this enquiry is as to attitudes to Sergeant McCabe and any translation of that into malicious behaviour or inappropriate action. In that regard, the tribunal is specifically mandated to enquire into any use by "Commissioner O’Sullivan" of "false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds" which may have been "inappropriately relied on ... to discredit" him before the Commission of Investigation chaired by Mr Justice Kevin O’Higgins. That enquiry makes relevant any "contacts between members of An Garda Síochána" and the media, or "members of the Government" or any other "relevant person" at the tribunal’s discretion. This hearing will incorporate any issue as to the RTÉ broadcasts of 9 May 2016 and the role, if any, of Commissioner O’Sullivan.I ask all Members to accept, as I believe they will, that it is imperative that the tribunal be allowed to proceed with its work. I am legally advised that the extremely broad nature of the motion renders it unclear in the specific context what additional terms of reference, if any, might contain or seek to achieve in the public interest.

We are all agreed that not only are these matters important, but they have now become urgent. I am advised by the Attorney General that the law governing tribunals mandates that an amendment to the terms of reference would require a fresh resolution of both Houses followed by the Government acceding to the request of the tribunal. This would clearly impact on the very strict timeframe before us. We all look forward to the commencement of the public sessions on 8 or 9 January.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	The motion before the House seeks, in general terms, an amendment of the terms of reference of the disclosures tribunal in order that it can take into account what are referred to as "the recent revelations regarding the Department of Justice and Equality". In discussing the motion, it is important to take ourselves back to 16 February when the House, and the Seanad on the following day, passed resolutions establishing the disclosures tribunal and ask ourselves what knowledge we had at the time we considered the terms of reference. There were three real issues at the time which led to the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry. First, a protected disclosure had been made by a superintendent based in the Garda press office. While we had known of the disclosure previously, a report of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill indicated that it required further investigation. He was not in a position to assess it based on the paper review he carried out and he recommended a commission of investigation. As such, there was a general consensus in the House that there should be a commission of investigation to examine the allegations made by Superintendent Taylor in his protected disclosure. Second, a fact came to light in February which was probably the main reason that the debate changed from one on a commission of investigation to one on a tribunal of inquiry. That was the revelation that there was a Tusla file. A number of days before the debate in the House on 16 February, it was revealed on an RTÉ programme that a Tusla file had been created in respect of Sergeant McCabe which contained allegations which we now know to be false. Third, there was a general allegation floating around at the time which was mentioned in certain media organs and the House, albeit it did not receive as much prominence as the protected disclosure or the Tusla file. That was the allegation that the Commissioner had cross-examined Sergeant McCabe in the O'Higgins commission in an unfair manner, if I can use that term, and that she had put to him allegations which were false, including false allegations of sexual abuse. Those are the three issues which were in everyone's mind when we came to discuss the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry. Clearly, it was really when the issue of the Tusla file emerged that the House recognised that a commission of investigation was unsatisfactory and we wanted a tribunal of inquiry. The person who initially prompted that idea was the solicitor for Sergeant McCabe and the House was happy to accede to it. Subsequent to the acceptance that there would be a tribunal of inquiry, there was consultation with the parties by the former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. We all had an opportunity to have an input into the terms of the reference. Given the time available, we did pretty well in terms of the extensive terms of reference we managed to get through the House. The next day, 17 February, the tribunal was formally established through a statutory instrument signed by the Minister. From my own point of view, it never occurred to me on 16 and 17 February that the Minister was aware of a strategy that had been adopted by the Garda Commissioner in the O'Higgins commission of investigation. In fact, there was a dispute about that Garda strategy. It was mentioned in the Irish Examiner and in the House and the response was that there was one page of transcript and that it was not possible to speak about it because the inquiry was conducted in private. The general assumption was that it was an issue in dispute whether there was a strategy engaged in by the Garda Commissioner at the O'Higgins commission of investigation. No one ever thought the Minister was in any way aware of it, involved in it or even acquiescing in it. It is important to know where we were back in February. That is where we were then, but let us think of where we are now. The motion states that the terms of reference need to be amended to take into account recent revelations regarding the Department of Justice and Equality. The issue around those revelations can be succinctly stated as follows, namely, whether the previous Minister for Justice and Equality was aware of the fact that there was an aggressive challenge to Sergeant McCabe's motivation and integrity at the O'Higgins commission of investigation. The information we have now suggests the Minister was aware. We have that information from emails dated 15 May 2015 and 4 July 2015, which were disclosed recently. The extent to which the Minister was aware of, acquiesced in or was involved in this issue is a matter of public concern. We only know a certain number of facts at this stage, which is what we see in the emails, but we do not know everything else. What we need to do is look at the terms of reference as they exist to determine whether they cover the issue which has recently arisen on foot of these revelations. The Minister is correct technically to refer to term of reference [e] which requires the sole member to investigate whether the false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds were inappropriately relied upon by former Commissioner O'Sullivan to discredit Sergeant McCabe at the commission of investigation under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins. That is very specific and limits the question to whether the former Commissioner engaged in this strategy. The reason that term of reference was included was because we did not know at the time whether there was any truth to the allegation and whether the former Commissioner had done that. Paragraph [h] of the terms of reference says there should be an investigation of contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and members of the Government and any other State agencies in relation to the matters set out, inter alia, at paragraph [e]. On a technical interpretation of those terms of reference, the Minister is correct that this comes within their ambit. Had it not been for recent revelations, however, it is unlikely that the tribunal of inquiry would have investigated the issues we are discussing today, namely, whether the Minister was aware of the fact that this strategy was adopted before the O'Higgins commission of investigation. Yesterday, the Minister for Justice and Equality stated that 230 documents had been disclosed by the Department to the tribunal. I wonder how many of those relate to the issue we are talking about here today, namely, the extent to which the Minister was aware of the strategy. I do not know, but I suspect that most of those 230 documents relate to other aspects of the terms of reference which are not the subject of the recent revelations. If all we had were the terms of reference from 16 February 2017 and the recent revelations that came out, I would have a concern that the chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Charleton, might not think it necessary or appropriate to investigate this issue. Fortunately, however, he made a statement last Friday which was extremely helpful.It epitomised what a tribunal should do because we establish a tribunal "to inquire urgently into" matters of public importance that give rise to "public disquiet". This is an issue that has given rise to huge public disquiet. Last Friday, he issued a public notice in which he elaborated how he intends to interpret the terms of reference and what he says will be the way he will conduct his investigation. He said in that notice he will start hearings on 8 January 2018. In paragraph 3 of his notice, he said:In considering those terms of reference, the tribunal is mandated by the Oireachtas, under terms of reference [h], to "investigate contact between members of An Garda Síochána" and "any relevant person" which the tribunal "may deem necessary to carry" out its work. This includes, but is not limited to, "members of the Government", the media, social services and "any other State entities". This grouping of terms of reference will be dealt with in a single hearing with a view to completing the hearings of the tribunal with the utmost expedition. This is subject to the cooperation of the parties... [In that regard,] the tribunal is specifically mandated to enquire into any use by "Commissioner O'Sullivan" of "false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds" which may have been "inappropriately relied on... to discredit" him before the Commission of Investigation chaired by Mr Justice Kevin O'Higgins. That enquiry makes relevant any "contacts between members of an Garda Síochána" and the media, or "members of the Government" or any other "relevant person" at the tribunal's discretion. The statement issued by the tribunal chairman last Friday is clear and unambiguous. He is going to investigate, starting on 8 January, the issues which were the subject of recent revelations, which gave rise to public disquiet over the past two weeks. Members of Government over the past week or so also repeatedly emphasised that these issues would be dealt with in the tribunal. There is no suggestion that members of the Government will not expose themselves to the investigation of this matter. There is no suggestion that the Department of Justice and Equality will not co-operate with this inquiry and there is clear evidence that Mr. Justice Charleton regards the recent revelation as being a matter he is going to investigate. In light of the statement that the chairman issued last Friday, I do not have any concern that the terms of reference are not wide enough and I believe that we should be very careful about interfering in the process that is up and running, which is being run very efficiently and which has its timeline to start public hearings in respect of these matters on 8 January next.  The tribunal was established on 17 February and had its first public sitting ten days later, on 27 February 2017. The opening notice published by the chairman of the tribunal reveals that he is fully aware of the issues of public concern. He has indicated that he will deliver reports on a modular basis. There was a public hearing in respect of another member of An Garda Síochána, and I understand that the report on that module will be delivered this week. He has also delivered a first interim report in which he has set out the basis upon which he is proceeding with his work. If we are going to change terms of reference, we should do so in consultation with the chairman of the tribunal. The last thing we want to do is to stick our size 13 foot into terms of reference which seem to be operating efficiently until a group of politicians get together and say they have a better idea. Every person who has co-operated with the tribunal to date has done so on the basis of the terms of reference set out from February of this year. If it is now to be the case that those terms of reference are going to be changed, individuals could come along and say they co-operated on the basis of the terms of reference as set out. If they are now told there is to be some other requirement or some other line of investigation they will have a legitimate concern to state in light of that they are going to reassess their position. People have provided documents to this tribunal on the basis of a certain understanding, that it is going to investigate the issues here. It may be worthwhile, and I urge the Minister to consider doing this and I will be interested to hear what other colleagues in the House think of it, for the Minister to write to the chairman of the tribunal, noting his public notice of last Friday, referring to this motion and stating that if he believes there is any necessity for the terms of reference to be amended or changed in any way this House would be receptive to that. If the chairman said that in light of recent revelations he needs the terms of reference slightly amended in order to enable him to investigate this line, we would no doubt all agree to that. In his opening statement, the chairman of the tribunal referred to the work that the tribunal is required to do. Many people misunderstand what a tribunal of inquiry does. It investigates and reports on facts. It is not a body that apportions criminal or civil liability and it is certainly not a body responsible for making people politically accountable, an argument mooted in previous days. It will consider the evidence it has and reach findings of fact in respect of that evidence based on the terms of reference. It starts with a blank sheet of paper. It is wholly dependent on information being provided to it and evidence being given to it. Documentary evidence is crucial to a tribunal of inquiry because it gives an indication as to the contemporary statements, thinking and attitudes of individuals at the time those documents were generated. It is easy to come along and say that one did something two years ago but if there is an email from one stating X, Y or Z, it is more difficult to get away from that. It is absolutely imperative that everyone co-operate in providing documents. One of the difficult aspects of this tribunal, however, in respect of the term of reference about the commission of investigation is that many of the documents may be legally professionally privileged. A person who prepares a document for a commission of investigation is entitled subsequently to say, if it has been prepared with legal advice, that they will not disclose that document because it was generated under legal professional privilege and they are entitled to claim that privilege. I asked the Minister yesterday, and I am not trying to tie him down to an answer now, but it would be interesting for the House to know if the Department of Justice and Equality has sworn an affidavit of discovery for the tribunal of inquiry. If an affidavit of discovery has been sworn, and I assume it has been, is the Department claiming privilege over documents which were generated in 2014, 2015 and 2016? The Department is obviously receiving legal advice today. Nobody is suggesting that written legal advice should have its claim of privilege lifted. In terms of documents dating from 2014, 2015 and 2016 relevant to the O'Higgins commission, however, the Department should waive its claim to privilege. The former Commissioners have waived their privilege attaching to any confidentiality that may exist in respect of their communications with other journalists. The documents of 15 May 2015 and 4 July 2015 are particularly interesting because they evidence an awareness on the part of the Minister of a strategy being adopted by the Garda Commissioner at the O'Higgins commission of investigation. On the basis of those documents, there are a couple of facts which we can now say with certainty are true. First, there was a strategy by the Garda Commissioner at the O'Higgins commission of investigation to challenge the motivation of Maurice McCabe and to question him aggressively. The second fact is that the Minister was aware of that strategy at the O'Higgins commission of investigation. Those facts broaden the issue of concern for this House. They should be investigated and I know they will be.It is surprising that the two documents that were not disclosed out of 232 relevant documents were documents which evidenced an awareness on the part of the Minister. For the past 24 or 36 hours we have heard condemnation of officials in the Department of Justice and Equality. We have heard that it is a dysfunctional Department. My only interaction with officials from it was in respect of a parole Bill and I found them to be extremely professional and efficient. What needs to be carefully scrutinised - we hope it is not the case - is whether politicians are seeking to blame officials in a Department for an error, which seems to have as its only benefit the protection of a Minister who was recorded as being aware of a particular topic. When it comes to what was wrong about the O'Higgins commission of investigation and the strategy adopted there by the Garda Commissioner, we must reflect on what happened at the Guerin inquiry. The Guerin report which was published in May 2014 answered the question about Sergeant McCabe's motivation. It concluded that he was a person of integrity and recommended that there be a commission of investigation to investigate his complaints. It was for this reason he was, no doubt, so surprised - I am so surprised - that when the commission of investigation started, there was an attack on his motivation and integrity. In the light of this, I do not think it is necessary to amend the terms of reference.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	There is no doubt that the events of the past few weeks have damaged confidence in the Government. They have probably damaged confidence in politics generally and certainly have inflicted further damage on the administration of justice. Last night the Taoiseach referred to the Department of Justice and Equality as dysfunctional. This is a damning criticism of any Department, doubly so coming from the head of the Government. Followed by the immediate resignation of the Secretary General, I am sure it has not done much for morale in the Department. In the past fortnight we have seen evidence of maladministration in the Department. The silo-driven culture of secrecy referenced in the Toland report has once more been on display. Reasonable questions should receive reasonable answers. Instead, what we had was obfuscation, records being forgotten and then belatedly found and a remarkably casual attitude towards briefing people who were expected to answer questions before the House fully and truthfully. There has been much talk about the Department, but it has always been the case that the Minister is the political head and responsible for it. There was the old idiom that the Minister was the corporation sole. Also in the old days every item of correspondence sent from the Department began with the phrase "I am directed by the Minister". It always caused me concern as Minister that thousands of letters were being sent every day stating "I am directed by the Minister". It was to underscore political oversight of the Department by the Minister. It is an important point, of which we should not lose sight in this House. Last night I spoke about my scepticism of the independence of the review of these events being carried out by the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department. I still have these concerns. I welcome the immediate response of the Minister that he is open to others being involved, perhaps in tandem, because we need somebody with inside knowledge of how a Department works. I might perhaps come back to the Minister with a suggestion in that regard. I am also sceptical about the stated commitment to implement the Toland report of 2014. The point was that implementation of its recommendations was to be immediate. All of the recommendations made were to have been worked into place within two years, but we now know that this did not happen. A failure to administer justice adequately has seen a remarkable number of resignations in recent years, up until yesterday. We have seen all of them mentioned in the newspapers and they include the resignations of two Garda Commissioners, yet none of us can contribute to this debate with confidence that deep and lasting change has occurred as a result of all of this, dating back to the Morris review. I had occasion to speak to Mr. Frank McBrearty Jr. this morning and it was almost like revisiting all of the issues again. We have to be real about the changes we want to bring about. In particular, the attitude to whistleblowers of those involved in the justice sector has really been deplorable. The revelation that when Sergeant McCabe was being lauded publicly, a strategy was being deployed behind closed dooors to do him real harm speaks volumes. In recent days we have been discussing the failure to stop this from happening and it brings us to the core of the motion in front of us. It goes without saying the Labour Party will support anything that will ensure a full and comprehensive explanation of what happened to Sergeant McCabe is fully ventilated and exposed. In general terms, I certainly support the intent of the motion. My only question is whether a revision of the terms of reference is actually necessary. It appears that the Department has - we hope - provided all relevant material for the tribunal and I know that the Minister hopes it is now finally comprehensive. We can, therefore, safely assume that the Department at least regards this matter as being fully encompassed by the terms of reference already passed by the Houses, as confirmed by the Minister today. From Mr. Justice Charleton's response to the Minister's submission, we can also assume that he regards this issue as being within his ambit, but it is worth confirming that this is actually the case. In the first instance, it is appropriate for the Minister and the Government to engage with Mr. Justice Charleton. His views should be sought on the scope of his existing terms of reference and whether he regards them as sufficiently robust and broad to encompass all recent events. The Government might then return and explain this to the House and explain the views of the inquiry on these matters and whether there is, therefore, a need for the House to revise the terms of reference. If that suggestion is accepted, it could be done speedily in the matter of a day or two. Then, at least, we would not waste the valuable time of this House in debating changes to terms of reference that were not needed or unnecessary if the judge himself, the sole member of the tribunal, regards such changes as unnecessary. I am mindful of the comments of Deputy Jim O’Callaghan. I always regard his contributions as worth listening to because he has great experience of legal matters, although I thought his reasoning was a little odd in that he said no changes were necessary because they were already encompassed but that if we did make a change, the people already encompassed might object to the new terms. That does not seem to be consistent logic. If what the Sinn Féin Deputies want to achieve has already been achieved in the terms of reference, nobody will have any difficulty in underscoring it for certainty, ar eagla na heagla, as one might say. I thank Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for tabling the motion because it gives us an opportunity to focus once more on the substance of the matter rather than on much of the political debate that surrounded it in recent days. On behalf of the Labour Party, I am happy to support the motion, but I genuinely ask the Minister at the end of the debate to take as an interim step the suggestion I posit that he simply asks the tribunal whether there is a necessity to change the terms of reference or, as many believe, are they sufficiently broad to do all that is desired?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	There was much lamenting of the fate of the Tánaiste yesterday on the Government side of the House. Do not get me wrong - I have no axe to grind with her personally, but the person who has most to lament in this sorry saga is Sergeant Maurice McCabe who first had the bravery to make a complaint in 2006 about malpractice in An Garda Síochána.It is now 2017 and we still have not got to the bottom of how the institutions that are supposed to uphold justice sought to suppress an effort by a member of the Garda Síochána to do what the Garda is supposed to do, uphold the law and justice. He has been put through the wringer. Those who have fallen victim to the scandal surrounding Maurice McCabe are the people who were responsible for upholding justice and the law and who should have protected Maurice McCabe, but failed to do so. They failed to prevent the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe which, had it succeeded and had he not had the presence of mind to have a tape recorder with him at the meeting with the senior gardaí, would have ruined his life beyond repair. That is what is at stake here. Of course, it goes beyond individuals. If they can do that to one whistleblower, how can they be trusted to uphold justice for all of society? This motion proposes, in the aftermath of the scandals and revelations, that the Dáil was misled about what Ministers and Departments knew about the campaign to smear Maurice McCabe. It was hidden and information relevant to the Charleton tribunal was not handed over to the tribunal. Mr. Justice Charleton has made clear that this is a criminal offence. That is what we are discussing. Fintan O'Toole makes a very good case today that there is nothing ambiguous or problematic about the terms of reference of the Charleton tribunal. They are very clear that everything germane to the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe should be handed over to the tribunal. That means any and all Government officials, Ministers and members of the Garda Síochána who had information germane to this should have handed it over. However, and the Minister is right to nod, they did not do that. That is a key point. It is entirely justified to suggest that we examine the terms of reference. Sinn Féin has done us a favour in making that suggestion this evening, whether it is a matter of adding a few lines or a matter of questioning whether we can trust either the politicians who are responsible for ensuring this information is provided or the officials or both to give the information which Mr. Justice Charleton needs and has insisted he must have. Then we get to the game of ping pong between the politicians and the departmental officials. The implication is that it did not happen under the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and perhaps under the current Minister - I do not know as I am not quite clear about the explanation he is giving for the failure of his Department to hand over this material when it was supposed to. However, it did not happen under his or the previous Minister's watch. The fish rots from the head, or at least the head must take responsibility. If the Minister's explanation is that it was the officials, he is saying that dysfunctional, rotten, corrupt, incompetent - I do not know what we can call them - officials are running rings around the Ministers who are supposed to run the Departments. That is what he is telling us. It is a damning indictment. Is the Minister telling us that officials are running rings around him or is it, in fact, politics at play, not incompetent officials? Is it a combination of both, with officials doing what they think the politicians want them to do or doing what politicians are giving them the nod and wink to do? I do not know. However, as Deputy O'Callaghan asked, who benefitted from the fact that the emails were suppressed? It is the Minister who is named as knowing things that she said she did not know. What is the Latin phrase for checking who benefits? I cannot remember. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle's Latin is better than mine.

That begs the question: even if we get commitments now that all the relevant documents are handed over, how do we know, despite all the hubbub, that they will be handed over? What the Sinn Féin Deputies suggest in their terms of reference is stated in the existing terms of reference and the interpretation that Mr. Justice Charleton has given of them. Sinn Féin's additional terms of reference refer to the Department of Justice and Equality and its officials. I would extend that to all Departments, Ministers and any other Government body that might have known. I chatted to the Taoiseach yesterday about all of this. He said, as was said in the House today, that he believed Deputy Frances Fitzgerald would not have set out to try to destroy a whistleblower. I do not know whether that is true. She appears to be a decent individual but the question is-----

What I cannot judge or what I find difficult to explain, and I do not know why the Minister is shaking his head, is how all this information could be in her Department and we are told it was not discussed. We are told that people forgot about it. It was so unimportant or registered so little at the time that people just forgot about it. It was the biggest political hot potato imaginable for the Government but it was just not discussed. However, was it discussed with other Ministers at the time? Other Departments and Ministers, therefore, and any communications they had relating to the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe should be also included in the information that is handed over to the Charleton tribunal.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	I am sharing time with Deputy Clare Daly. There is no need to revise the terms of reference for the Charleton tribunal and we will not support the motion. Paragraph (h) of the terms of reference states:(h) To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and:Media and broadcasting personnel,Members of the Government,Tusla,Health Service Executive,any other State entities,or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work relevant to the matters set out in [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above. We wrote to Mr. Justice Charleton last March, before the tribunal started and before the issues of the last two weeks came to light, asking him to include the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Taoiseach and their contact with An Garda Síochána when the hearings under paragraph [h] are to take place. With regard to paragraph (h) and "any other State entities", Mr. Justice Charleton has said that he interprets this as "including any body whether established by statute or otherwise or supported or established by the State". Obviously, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's Office fall under this category. If, for the sake of argument, the recently retired Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality argues that he does not fall under this category any more, and I am not saying that he will do so, he is caught in the next category, "or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work relevant to the matters set out ...". The same applies to the retired deputy secretary general, Ken O'Leary, who was interacting with Nóirín O'Sullivan by email or even my good friend, the former Minister, former Deputy Alan Shatter. To give credit to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, paragraph [h] in the terms of reference is a catch-all provision. If Mr. Justice Charleton wishes to speak to somebody, he can. I spoke to a solicitor for the tribunal today who told me the tribunal is starting with paragraph [h] on 8 January next.Mr. Justice Charleton has the power to ask the Oireachtas to amend the terms of reference for the tribunal and he has not done so. His work to date has been excellent. We have been down to the tribunal on three occasions and have been seriously impressed with him. We think he is a right one. A broader issue that has been highlighted in the past two weeks involves how Departments and State bodies deal with records. Sinn Féin wants the terms of reference revised to take into account that there was a suppression of documents or other information which should have been provided to the disclosures tribunal. The problem with this is that there is no legislation that states that Departments or State entities are obliged to make records in the first place. The Freedom of Information Act 2014 and National Archives Acts, which constitute the legislation that regulates State records, only apply where a record actually exists in the first place. Neither Act requires Government Departments or State entities to make records in the first instance. There is no overall regulation of maintaining records so each Department has its own system. While the Charleton tribunal has the powers to compel the production of evidence, these powers are of little use where the evidence never existed. NAMA is a perfect example. It now has a policy of deleting the emails of staff one year after they have left the agency. This should be illegal but, unfortunately, it is not. We need legislation in this area. NAMA came under FOI on 13 April 2015. A number of days before that, on 12 March 2015, at a board meeting, NAMA said that it was recommended that the board resolve to approve the proposal that email records of NAMA officers be deleted one year after their departure from the agency and that approval was also sought to apply this proposal retrospectively to the email records of former NAMA officers. No good Government would have allowed that to happen. I know the Minister did not do it but the former Minister for Finance did and it was a crazy thing to do. It was like destroying the records of the State. It was nuts given that this is a State body and should be open to scrutiny. Deputy O'Callaghan asked whether the Minister was aware of the strategy applied by the former Commissioner or whether the terms of reference for the tribunal might be a bit different if we had known that. I do not agree. I think the Deputy is underestimating Mr. Justice Charleton, who is perfectly capable of dealing with this. I have 100% confidence in him.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	I understand fully the motivation of Sinn Féin in tabling the motion. Given that the motion of no confidence was cancelled, it was entirely appropriate that we would discuss these justice issues. However, like Deputy Wallace, I do not see any need to support a change in the terms of reference. I must say, and I am not talking about Sinn Féin, that some of the ignorance that has been on display over the past two weeks in the public domain and in here regarding these issues has been shocking. The idea that what went on could have gone on without the knowledge of the Department of Justice and Equality and people in here standing up and acting surprised about that constitute a condemnation of where they have been and their lack of engagement around these serious issues over the past period. A member of the public sent me an email yesterday in which she reminded me of Abraham Lincoln's definition of a hypocrite, which I think is a very good one. He said a hypocrite was the man who murdered his parents and then pleaded for mercy on the grounds that he was an orphan. That is what we have seen here. People who are culpable in what went on over the past number of years have stood up and portrayed themselves as champions of justice, Maurice McCabe and whistleblowers inside An Garda Síochána. It makes us utterly sick to witness some of it. Let us be clear. Deputy O'Callaghan said that when the information came out in May 2016, we did not know if it was true or not. We did know it was true. At that time, Fianna Fáil chose to close its ears because it was politically expedient for it. The Labour Party chose to stand up full square 100% behind Nóirín O'Sullivan. At that time, we were already on the record as warning the former Minister that she would be brought down by the former Commissioner. Eighteen times prior to that, we raised issues regarding the way Garda whistleblowers were being treated behind the scenes despite what was being said in public. These chickens have very firmly come home to roost. It is completely wrong of people who supported the former Commissioner full square at that time to turn around and blame the former Minister for not acting on that information in 2015. The terms of reference and the role of the Department and the Minister were well articulated here in the discussions around the commission of investigation originally and what became the Charleton tribunal so it is utterly wrong of Deputy O'Callaghan to say it was unlikely that Mr. Justice Charleton would have investigated these issues. That is just wrong. Of course, he was going to investigate them. The terms of reference specifically provide for it. As Deputy Wallace said, we wrote to him on 10 March this year and asked him to include them but I do not think we needed to because having seen him conducting himself in previous cases he handled such as pyrite cases and having attended the tribunal, I can say that he is an incredibly capable individual. We do not need to tell him how to do his job. There are huge issues of dysfunctionality in the Department of Justice and Equality that will continue outside the scope of this. We need an opportunity in here and for that, I am glad Sinn Féin did table a justice motion but there is no need to extend the terms of reference. They are well provided for in this case and I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	313	I am also delighted to be able to speak on the motion. I will read it into the record:That Dáil Éireann believes that a revision of the terms of reference of the Tribunal of Inquiry into protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and certain other matters (the 'Charleton Tribunal') is required and should take place to take account of the recent revelations regarding the Department of Justice and Equality, Ministers for Justice and Equality past and present, the Attorney General's Office and An Garda Síochána.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Sinn Féin motion. It is timely and necessary given what we have learnt in recent days about the level of dysfunctionality within the Department of Justice and Equality. I know the Minister might say that he is learning as well but we all need to learn and learn very fast. I must say, however, that while we can and should criticise the Department for its more obvious failings, it would be reprehensible to use this crisis as an opportunity to tarnish vindictively or otherwise the good name of the majority of the staff in that Department. I lay the blame squarely at the top. I know the Secretary General has brought forward his retirement. I wish him well but it is not very helpful to the Minister. Regardless of whether we like it or not, the culture of so many organisations is usually a top-down process. It is the case with all organisations in this country. They forget about the ordinary people and where they came from and many of them forget about public service when they get so high up and so high and mighty. The political realities that the Department had to deal with over the past 40 years in terms of threats from the Provisional movement, loyalist gangsters and all other crime made it necessary for a legitimate level of secrecy to exist. We can all understand that. We still need that secrecy for certain operations to deal with the thugs who are robbing, marauding and destroying the lives of so many families in this country. We can all understand why that was needed. However, it should have become apparent a long time ago that the need for such levels of secrecy had passed and it was time for the Department to adapt itself to a new culture of transparency and open accountability and not to be dragged kicking and screaming around the place in this House and elsewhere. I believe that what this motion is broadly seeking to achieve can only be a good thing. Let us cast the net as wide as possible in terms of gaining the kind of insight we need regarding what really went on and who knew what and when. It is necessary for us to find that out and that Mr. Justice Charleton gets all the information and is allowed to do his job and that such a situation would never arise again whereby very senior Department officials - I am not saying they found or discovered these things recently - would refuse to give full disclosure after being requested to do so by Mr. Justice Charleton and others. Someone asked whether it involved breaking the law. I think it did involve breaking the law. If it was accidental, it did not involve breaking any law but it could not be accidental. These kind of accidents do not happen. It is a deliberate denial of co-operation with what is required.The original form of the motion is not the one we are debating. One of the terms of reference was to examine the role of Tusla. It originally sought in clause D to investigate the creation, distribution and use by Tusla of a file containing false allegations of sexual abuse against Sergeant Maurice McCabe that was allegedly sent to the Garda in 2013. It beggars belief that the apology was delivered to the wrong door. It would not be written in a Mills and Boon novel. It is bizarre. We are back again to the days of GUBU which I remember in the early 1980s. This is certainly GUBU. I accept that we are now dealing with an amended form of the motion. However, it is vital that questions such as the one about Tusla are explored further. Tusla is an organisation in which I have very little faith. It has been cut off from the HSE like the Rock of Gibraltar; it has been cut off and left to its own devices and, in many cases that come before me, without much accountability. It is not within the remit of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan - thankfully, says he. This may be something the tribunal is examining, but the role of Tusla in the current debacle demands further scrutiny. We must also remember that we are here not only because of an alleged failure of duty but also because of the systemic lack of accountability. It could not be called anything other than systemic. There is no accountability, as I have been preaching for a number of years.  Some years ago I talked about the power of the House, to which the banks are oblivious. They do not care because we are inept at passing legislation to deal with them and what they have done. The senior officials are running the show. Ministers come and go and the officials are still the bosses. Incidentally, if I go back to the days of the late Brian Lenihan - God rest him - when the pension levy was introduced, they were the only cohort of people who escaped it. I brought it to his notice and he thanked me at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting for raising the matter because he had been told there was only a small cohort of 70 which ended up nearer to 1,000. They got away with not paying the pension levy when every other unfortunate taxpayer had to pay it. Why was that? It was because they had their hands on the handlebars of power. One would have needed a hammer and chisel or a jackhammer to take them off it. There is no accountability; they are accountable to no one.  We will have to reach a situation where the Secretary General will be elected by the people; otherwise we will have no accountability. They can send false information. They can send emails to tell people that it is a very serious matter but that no action is required. I do not believe it and have no ill-will against the former Tánaiste, but I do not believe it about something that serious. I have seen Ministers and Taoisigh taking very urgent calls. They have to deal with such issues, unless they are really blasé about it. They have to write the email, tick the boxes and tell themselves that they have done their jobs. It is a case of pass the parcel and there being no accountability. It is time people were held accountable. They should not be heading off with their fat pensions and then brought back to sit on interview boards or placed on different boards. The system is sick, broken and disgusting and must be changed. I wish the Minister well in that regard and hope he will have the stamina for it. He has been around here long enough to know where they are hiding, where the deadwood is and where the good people are. He should promote the right people. There should not be cronyism and there should be no party political people. We complain about the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, but he was right when he wrote about the untouchables. They are here with us every day and one cannot say "Boo" to them. They have all the new rules, regulations and statutory instruments that they print. When we receive them from the European Union, they add about ten more statutory instruments to keep themselves in business. They create quangos for their friends. It is a rotting, stinking, disgusting culture. There are many good people in all Departments and organisations, but the cream that has risen to the top is not interested in serving Ireland. We are coming up to the centenary of the War of Independence. I said a while ago that if they were to come back, I know where they would start shooting and it would not be at people from another country, which I am not advocating.

I have listened to what Deputy Clare Daly said. I agree with the intent of the motion that the terms of reference need to be revisited. My recollection of us setting them in February this year is that it was very typical of how the Oireachtas worked. There was a real political head of steam about what had happened with the Tusla files on the allegations made against Sergeant McCabe being shared by the Garda. There was also a lack of trust between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about whether they were being told the truth. At the time everyone thought we were in a political crisis that would lead to the fall of the Government. However, as soon as that issue was teased out and resolved - it did not lead to an immediate political problem - the difficulty was that when we came to set the terms of reference, we rushed through the last critical piece and did not get them right. We did not spend the right amount of time on it. We had very limited time to actually set the terms of reference.  We tabled a number of amendments to address the concern that the terms of reference which allowed for an investigation of communications up to May 2014 should be extended to May 2016. We felt that the terms of reference were excessively narrow and restrictive in looking at the emails sent between RTÉ, the Garda and other bodies that were involved. As I mentioned in one of the debates with the Taoiseach yesterday, we proposed that the Department of Justice and Equality be listed as one of the organisations subject to investigation. The Taoiseach said the current terms of reference covered that eventuality because one of the subclauses allowed for the Charleton tribunal to look at other State bodies. I think the original wording was deliberately drafted in such a way as to try to keep the Department of Justice and Equality out of the frame. That is the concern.  To a certain extent, what we have heard about in the past two weeks gives me valid reason for such concern. My concern is based on the fact that a tribunal is a cumbersome and awkward body. I have been involved in one or two previously. Unless the terms of reference are really nailed down and there is real clarity about what is being investigated, there is a danger that the tribunal judge could say he or she is not being given that leeway. There is a case to be made for a more forensic re-examination of the terms of reference to take into account what we have heard here in the past two weeks. That is a hugely important part of what is happening. If we are to restore faith in the Department, the House and the entire process, we need to carry through the objective which the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday of full transparency and seeking the truth. What is to be lost by really looking at the terms of reference to make sure we will actually achieve this objective? If there had not been a resignation yesterday, if the matter had been resolved between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and it was decided that the Charleton tribunal would be the body to discern the truth of what had happened with the Department of Justice and Equality emails, we would have been on an incredibly tight timeline because the whole political system would have been waiting for the outcome. Some of that pressure is now off us. Therefore, I do not see what is to be lost by having a completely thorough review and revision of the terms of reference of the tribunal to take account of what has happened. That is important for the Department of Justice and Equality. There have been many things said in recent days, but I think everyone agrees - the Minister and the Taoiseach have said it - that the Department has to come out of this as a completely changed institution. Taking the example we put forward, it is perfectly valid to include the Department in the terms of reference and to allow the tribunal to specifically examine how it acted. In response to questions we asked last night, I understood the Minister to say that the emails had not been forwarded to the tribunal as a result of certain legal difficulties. I did not get an opportunity to ask about the exact nature of those legal difficulties. However, I would like to know because that is not an insignificant issue and it deserves to be the subject of a separate strand within the tribunal, which we could set out in the latter's terms of reference. If there are legal issues, the Charleton tribunal is perfectly placed to consider them and to come back to this House with a view as to whether they are valid. I cannot see a better way for us to look at that. The alternative would be to wait for the DPP to take a criminal prosecution or to try to build up a case. That would certainly not be quicker and I would prefer it to go through a tribunal process. I agree with Deputy Clare Daly; I trust Mr. Justice Charleton to be able to make an assessment of those legal arguments and to come back to this House with a recommendation as to whether it was appropriate. Whether there are criminal trials after that would be decided separately. That is one example of an issue in respect of which we need to ask real questions and obtain some independent assessment, and the Charleton tribunal is perfectly placed to facilitate this. We should avail of the opportunity to amend the terms of reference in light of what has happened and ask for an opinion specifically on that point. In his wrap-up, the Minister may have a chance to answer that question and give me some indication as to what are the legal difficulties in respect of providing the relevant emails to the tribunal. I would appreciate that. Even if he is able to do so, I would still argue that the matter to which I refer would make a very valid case for revision of the terms of reference to ensure that we get clear answers to those questions. I commend the Sinn Féin motion, which we fully support.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	Everything has changed since the Charleton tribunal was established. The last two weeks have obviously been very problematic for everybody, especially the Government. Everything has changed, except the terms of reference relating to the tribunal. Those who have spoken against the motion miss the point entirely. We have read the terms of reference line by line. Nothing in those terms of reference allows Mr. Justice Charleton to investigate whether there was a cover-up, whether there was suppression or withholding of documentation by senior Department of Justice and Equality officials or whether this was a collaborative approach by senior gardaí, politicians and senior departmental officials. The Government has not got its head around this simple fact. There was a vicious campaign and a legal strategy constructed by very powerful people in senior positions in An Garda Síochána to build a legal defence around something they knew to be a lie in order to discredit a whistleblower. They did so because that whistleblower came forward and alleged wrongdoing in An Garda Síochána. The solution from their perspective was to circle the wagons and attack the credibility of the person who brought forward the information. We saw exactly the same in the case of the Garda College in Templemore, where the approach was to attack the internal auditors and not face up to the reality of the problem. Again today we see the Government circling the wagons because it does not want the tribunal to be able to examine the very serious allegations of whether there was a cover-up. It seems that no lessons have been learned. On Friday and Saturday last, we again saw a circling of the wagons by the leaders of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to ensure there was not political accountability. Only on Monday, when it became absolutely clear that the former Tánaiste's position was untenable, was there movement. When it was clear from social media, from the media and from the political commentary that her position was absolutely untenable, only then did it become clear to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that their plan to circle the wagons had become unstuck. That is the reality and we are seeing more of it here today. The Minister and the Government have a choice. They can continue to work with their counterparts in Fianna Fáil to circle the wagons or they can amend the terms of reference to ensure Mr. Justice Charleton has the power to investigate whether there was a cover-up. The Minister and others have said that it is for Mr. Justice Charleton to decide whether he needs more powers. It is up to the Oireachtas to set terms of reference. The Minister and his party have been playing fast and loose with the rules of this House in recent weeks, claiming that people in the House who introduced motions of no-confidence should not be able to do so that they are playing games, and we are simply doing our job. The same thing is happening here today. The Minister is the one playing the games, as are his Government colleagues and, also, Fianna Fáil at times. He should stop the game playing. He should stand behind the whistleblower in this case. He should stand behind what is right and amend the terms of reference. Let us for the first time on this issue establish the truth and the facts.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	I commend Deputy Ó Laoghaire on bringing the motion to the floor of the House. I start by reading a statement released by the McCabe family earlier this year. I appeal to the House to listen to it because it is important. Please God, it might sway some of the doubters. It states:We have endured eight years of great suffering, private nightmare, public defamation and state vilification arising solely from the determination of Maurice to ensure that the Garda Síochána adheres to decent and appropriate standards of policing in its dealings with the Irish people.Our personal lives and our family life, and the lives of our five children, have been systematically attacked in a number of ways by agencies of the Irish state and by people working for the state in those agencies ...We have also been the subject of a long and sustained campaign to destroy our characters in the eyes of the public and public representatives and in the eyes of the media.The lesson from this statement, the lesson from the Garda campaign against Sergeant McCabe and his family and the lesson from State and Government complicity in this campaign is as follows. People who challenge this State or any of its pillars, or seeks to shine a light into dark corners to demand justice or truth should be prepared for an onslaught. They should be prepared to be ignored, sidelined and treated with suspicion. If that does not work, they should be prepared to have their careers and personal and public lives destroyed and the very worst slurs attached to their name, with all the power that the State has to enforce this. This is why the Charleton tribunal is so important and why it must be empowered to turn every stone necessary. The lesson so viciously taught to the Irish people must be learned. The suffering of Sergeant McCabe must be undone. In so doing this saga must be ended and with it the corruption it covered up. The tribunal must be allowed to bring out the truth and identify the real offenders and conspirators from the lowest garda right up to the Cabinet table if necessary. I again commend Deputy Ó Laoghaire on this. We need the terms of reference amended. Deputies have listened to the McCabes' testimony; this country is corrupt.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. It is a shame that we are still discussing the issue. The events of the past week have raised serious questions regarding the culture in the Department of Justice and Equality. The fundamental question is why the documents at the heart of this controversy were not discovered much earlier and sent to the Charleton tribunal. It has become very clear that without questions being raised in this House and the subsequent tabling of motions of no confidence, these documents might never have appeared before the tribunal. Our motion, and I commend my colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, on putting it forward, is very simple. We call on the Dáil to agree that the terms of reference of the Charleton tribunal need to be amended in order that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Department officials are explicitly included. The possibility of a deliberate failure to disclose central documents by both the Department and the Minister needs to be examined. The motivation for any such action must also be examined in fine detail. The fact is that this trawl of documents was done by the Department in order to ensure that all relevant documents were disclosed to the tribunal. It was not done, as it should have been, to ensure that justice was given to the McCabe family. If justice for the McCabe family was a priority, which it should have been, a trawl would have been carried out much sooner. It was merely done to avoid a general election and save the political careers of Fine Gael Deputies and perhaps even Fianna Fáil ones too. It makes a mockery of the tribunal. The Taoiseach's suggestion of a review of the Department of Justice and Equality to be carried out by an official in his Department is laughable. We need to get to the bottom of this scandal and an independent investigation needs to be done. We need to ensure that we have the full facts and establish the truth as to what went on in the Department. I call on all Deputies to support this motion in order that this work can take place and the McCabe family can see justice once and for all.

Despite the fact the Government has said that all those mentioned in our motion are already included in the State entity clause, we believe that making specific reference to the Minister and Department officials would strengthen the tribunal and that it would and should be a welcome statement of intent on the part of the Minister and the Taoiseach. We also propose to add a clause relating to the possibility of a cover-up, suppression or a deliberate failure to disclose central documents on behalf of the Department. We are all aware of what we have witnessed in recent days. A non-politically minded person might say that it is hard to credit what has come to light recently, but it is not. I refer to a Minister allowing something like this to happen; doing nothing to stop a nasty, ugly orchestrated smear and character assassination campaign of a person who was attempting to highlight wrongdoing; a Minister failing to challenge powerful agencies which were orchestrating that smear campaign against a whistleblower; and a Minister who was happy just to let it happen, to turn a blind eye, but why is that the case? It is because a Minister is confident of not being held to account.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	As the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has outlined, the Government is opposing this motion on two primary grounds. In the first instance, it is not clear what the party proposing the motion intends should be done or where the current terms of reference are, presumably, deficient. Second, the Government believes the terms of the reference of the tribunal, which this House agreed to last February, are sufficiently broad to cover the matters that have arisen in recent days. I might add that the Government fully supports the work of the tribunal and has co-operated with it and will continue to do so. In coming to this view, the Government is having regard to terms of reference [e] and [h], which provide as follows: paragraph [e] mandates the tribunal "To investigate whether the false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds were inappropriately relied upon by Commissioner O'Sullivan to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe at the Commission of Investigation into Certain Matters in the Cavan/Monaghan district under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins". Paragraph [h] requires it: To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and:— Media and broadcasting personnel,— members of the Government,— TUSLA,— Health Service Executive,— any other State entities,— or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work;relevant to the matters set out in [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] ... [of the terms of reference].These paragraphs contain mainly allegations that senior gardaí sought to discredit Sergeant McCabe.  The combined effect of these terms of reference could be viewed as encompassing examination of any communications between the Department of Justice and Equality, Ministers for Justice and Equality past and present, the Attorney General's office and An Garda Síochána regarding "legal strategy", which is presumably what the motion before the House is concerned with. Furthermore, it is not entirely clear what is meant by "recent revelations" in the motion. This is rather opaque and it is not at all clear as to what any additional terms of reference might contain, nor is it clear what they mean in the context of a tribunal which was appointed to examine matters of urgent public importance. Last week the tribunal issued a public notice in which it stated that it would sit from Monday, 8 January in relation to those terms of reference dealing with the allegations that senior gardaí sought to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The public notice made it clear that the tribunal is mandated by paragraph [h] of its terms of reference to investigate contacts between members of the Garda and members of the Government and any relevant person, among others, which it considers necessary to carry out its work. This notice also set out in broad terms how the tribunal intends to approach this aspect of its work. I want to make one further comment in regard to the tribunal's notice but before doing so I remind the House that my Department, having carried out a search of email correspondence following the tabling of a number of parliamentary questions, itself recovered the emails which have generated such controversy and which led, wrongly in my view, to the Tánaiste having to resign as Tánaiste and a member of the Government. Those emails have been disclosed to the tribunal and it is now for the tribunal to decide how to proceed in regard to them. Let me be clear about one thing: my Department has complied fully with the discovery orders issued to it by the tribunal. Discovery orders were issued by the tribunal in February, April and September. These orders were complied with and the relevant documents were forwarded to the tribunal in February, May and September 2017. For the benefit of the House I can say that the discovery orders concerned records of the O’Higgins commission of investigation, documents related to two cases which had been considered by the independent review mechanism, a copy of a representation to the then Minister which referenced Sergeant McCabe, a report of a Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigation into a complaint that a Garda investigation of an alleged serious assault was not properly carried out and records related to the allegation of contacts between the gardaí and Tusla regarding Garda Keith Harrison.  The Department has also made extensive voluntary disclosure of other matters, including three protected disclosures, reports from the Garda Commissioner under section 41 of the Garda Síochána Act and, most recently, the two email threads that were uncovered following a trawl of documents in the Department. However, having regard to recent events, I know that both the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I would be very happy to have the Department undertake any further inquiries or further scrutiny which may be required. I have no evidence of any outstanding issues. I would be happy to raise this with senior officials in my Department tomorrow. In the course of his statement in this House yesterday evening, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, undertook in response to a question from Deputy Harty to establish the position regarding discovery made by my Department to the disclosures tribunal in respect of Keith Harrison. I am advised that the Department of Justice and Equality has complied fully with a discovery order made by the tribunal in the context of its inquiry into matters covered by term of reference [n] investigating contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and Tusla regarding Garda Keith Harrison. The tribunal announced last week that it would be publishing its report on that module this week. In light of that, it was clearly open to Mr. Justice Charleton to indicate in the tribunal’s public notice whether the tribunal considered that its terms of reference were broad enough to allow it to investigate the matters which have lately been the subject of comment in this House and outside. No such suggestion was made. I should mention in this regard that the legislation covering the operation of tribunals allows for the terms of reference to be amended either at the request of the tribunal or following consultation with the tribunal. I am convinced, in the circumstances, that the best approach is to allow the tribunal to get on with its work unburdened with unnecessary amendment of its terms of reference. Mr. Justice Charleton has been very assiduous in his work to date and the House owes him a debt of gratitude for the expedition with which he is going about the job. In that regard I have no doubt that if he determines that the terms of reference are inadequate to allow him to investigate the issues thoroughly and reach solid conclusions, he will bring that to the attention of the Clerk of the House. Accordingly, I oppose the motion before us. I have been working with the Department of Justice and Equality for quite a number of years in my previous role as chairman of a committee and as a Minister of State.Obviously, the Department is not working. I do not think any agency or Department is working to the extent that it cannot be improved. It is true that the Department of Justice and Equality has made some mistakes. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, made a comprehensive speech to that effect in the House yesterday evening. I ask Deputies to reflect very carefully on their language. I take issue with some of the language I have heard used with reference to the Department of Justice and Equality during this afternoon's debate. Deputies should reflect carefully on their espousal of hysterical populism, which is very different from an expression of frustration about certain failings. The Department of Justice and Equality is a vast Department. In my experience, its staff are hard-working and diligent public servants. They are citizens of this State who are loyal to this State. They work extremely hard. In other jurisdictions, the areas of responsibility of our Department of Justice and Equality are divided among two or even three departments. Our Department has grown and grown for historical reasons. Issues like insolvency are often dealt with by the Department of Justice and Equality and can become very big. I have responsibility for the question of refugees and asylum seekers, which started off as a small issue a number of years ago but has now become a vast issue and is continuing to grow. The Department now has many more agencies than it previously did. We have to look at what has arisen in this respect. I refer to the size and volume of work being done by hard-working and diligent civil servants who are citizens of this country. They are very careful about the work they do. They work very hard. They often go above and beyond the call of duty. I have said that here previously. I know them and other Deputies here know them as well. We should be careful about casting aspersions. Instead, we should be looking at how we can change matters to improve the efficiency of the Department and ensure mistakes and errors of this nature do not occur again. Steps are being taken to get to the bottom of the issues that have arisen. The tribunal of inquiry is probably the strongest method we have in our armoury to get to the bottom of such issues. We should leave the issues to the tribunal. That is what we set it up for. That is its purpose. We need to let it get on with its job. We may have other actions to take when it reports. I thank the House.

That falsehood was that he was a paedophile. Furthermore, elements of the State sought to base an entire legal strategy around this falsehood. They codified a lie as a legal strategy to destroy a man who was asking honourable and decent questions. The manner in which they did so was calculated and cold. We are faced with the reality that it was not just one person who set out to destroy Maurice McCabe. It might not even have been one organisation. It looks like three different institutions had a hand in the efforts to destroy him. There are serious questions to be asked about the role of the Office of the Attorney General in this regard. One of the emails that were discovered recently shows that the Department of Justice and Equality discussed with the Office of the Attorney General the legal strategy for the case and whether the Minister could intervene. Up to now, most of the focus has been on whether the then Minister should have intervened and on whether she knew. My party has dealt with those issues. It concerns me that the Minister and the Office of the Attorney General both knew about the strategy and seemed to be fine with it. I will remind the House of the details of the strategy. It involved calling a whistleblower a paedophile in order to destroy him. The Office of the Attorney General knew about this. It discussed the strategy and sat down with the Department of Justice and Equality to weigh up its pros and cons. It seems that elements within the Office of the Attorney General accepted it. The only reason we know about all of this is because Maurice McCabe had the foresight to record his meeting with two gardaí. That tape is the only reason Maurice McCabe's reputation is not in tatters. The only variable that was not expected by the people involved in this was the variable that saved Maurice McCabe's reputation. This incredible act of brilliance and self-preservation has shone a light into the darkness at the heart of the State.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	I commend Deputy Ó Laoghaire on the introduction of this motion. The events of recent days have refocused the minds of many people on the problems in the Department of Justice and Equality. Nobody inside or outside this House has contradicted the contention that such problems also exist at the highest levels of An Garda Síochána and indeed at the heart of the Government. All of that was borne out in the treatment of Maurice McCabe. Following the revelations of the extent of these failures, there needs to be a full examination of the role of officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, current and former Ministers for Justice and Equality, the Office of the Attorney General and An Garda Síochána. We believe the information that has come to light in recent weeks raises serious questions about the institutions of the State, the protagonists in this affair and the scope of the terms of reference of the Charleton tribunal. Given that the terms of reference failed to catch information which was subsequently put into the public domain, we find it impossible to believe they can be considered fit for purpose. Most people who have been watching and reading about what has happened over the past week believe certain documents and information were specifically suppressed or deliberately not handed over to frustrate Mr. Justice Charleton's work. There is a belief that the restrictions on the documentation that could be handed over, and on the scope of who could be called before the tribunal, were deliberately contrived to limit the findings and somehow arrive at a pre-ordained result. If this is the case, it is imperative that this motion passes in order to ensure public confidence is restored. It has shocked the Irish public to the core to learn that when a sitting Minister was made aware that the Garda Commissioner adopted a strategy of questioning the motives of Maurice McCabe by trying to smear him by means of a completely false allegation that he was a child abuser, she did nothing about it. If the terms of reference are not broadened to take account of the recent revelations, I fear we will be back here to have the same conversation again. This is not about a head on a plate; it is about procedures, accountability and doing what is right by whistleblowers.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	The events of the past week have highlighted serious failures in the Department of Justice and Equality and in the Government. It is worrying to see how badly the dysfunctional Department and the Government have acted on this issue. This crisis has been exacerbated by the behaviour of Fine Gael, which has completely denied that there is a major problem here. The resignation of the former Tánaiste yesterday was the right decision in light of emails that revealed that she, and the Department she headed at the time, had far too close a connection with the legal strategy of the Garda Commissioner against Maurice McCabe. Leaving aside the issues with the strategic communications of members of the Government in recent days, it is alarming that these emails have come to light as a result of this controversy and were not passed to the disclosures tribunal in February when it called for all relevant documents to be submitted. If Members of the Oireachtas had not persisted and RTÉ's Katie Hannon had not kept on top of this issue, I doubt very much that these emails would ever have made it to the tribunal. Given that the Department of Justice and Equality set up the tribunal, it is even more unbelievable that these documents somehow remained hidden for many months. Many more questions on this issue remain to be answered. The resignation of the former Tánaiste does not answer them. It is just not believable that these emails were accidentally missed.

I regret that we have not been able to discuss the full motion we initially submitted. It was a more comprehensive motion, but there were procedural issues with it. It set out the specific changes to the terms of reference that we are advocating. It is unfortunate that some of the issues that would have been raised during a discussion on the actual changes we are proposing have perhaps been missed during this afternoon's debate. I refer, for example, to the additional areas that would have been taken in. We have full confidence in Mr. Justice Charleton. We believe he has the right attitude and the right approach. We expect that he will pursue everything possible right up to the lines of the terms of reference he has been given, but he cannot go any further than that. He cannot consider matters that are outside the terms of reference. We have suggested changes to the terms of reference in light of facts that were not really considered at the time of their setting. All parties had an input into the process of setting the terms of reference. We have no problem with the process that was used. The additional facts that have emerged need to be taken into consideration. We are proposing that the tribunal should be allowed to investigate the knowledge of officials, advisers and Ministers. At present, it is confined to investigating the knowledge of the former Garda Commissioners, Martin Callinan and Nóirín O'Sullivan.The key point related to the possibility of a cover-up, of suppression, or of deliberately not forwarding documentation on to the commission, which is a very serious issue. I challenge the Minister to find any head in the current terms of reference which would allow that to be investigated. There is none. There is no head which allows that to be investigated. I will return to that point. I am disappointed with the approach of Fianna Fáil. It seems that while much of the sentiment was positive, there is perhaps a desire to draw a line under this issue. That should not happen. There are clearly ongoing issues with the Department of Justice and Equality. It is difficult to explain many of the issues which have come up. I welcome the support of the Green Party, the Labour Party and a number of the Independent Deputies. I greatly respect the opinions of Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace. I pay tribute to their work on this issue which they carried out when few others were paying attention to it. I also acknowledge the presence of Deputy John McGuinness in the House. I differ in my analysis of the terms of reference, however. There is a clear difference in what we are proposing in respect of issues which were not anticipated at the time.  There is the issue of what the Minister knew, what she was responsible for and how much she knew about the legal strategy, but there is also the very serious matter of the withholding of relevant information from a tribunal, which is a criminal offence under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1997. It is a criminal matter for good reason. Some of the documentation which was most central to this issue and which made reference to the Minister was held by some of the most senior officials in the Department, by the Minister herself and by her key political team. For some reason, while 230 documents were found, these documents were not. It is not difficult to see why we, the public, or the media would see that as quite suspicious or as being problematic. It is possible to dispel that suspicion. In order to do that, the tribunal should be allowed to consider the matter.  The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach have said that they have no fear of the truth. If the truth is to emerge, this must be looked into. The review to which reference has been made will largely be an administrative effort. It will be carried out in private. These are serious matters which are very closely connected to the subject matter of the tribunal. Again, I challenge the Minister to identify a single head in the terms of reference as currently outlined which would allow Mr. Justice Charleton to look into the possibility of a cover-up, of suppression, or of the deliberate withholding of information. There is none. That is why we must revise the terms of reference.

#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	To continue from where I left off last night, I firmly believe that this would not have been the right thing to do and that an election would only have delayed a wide range of vital legislation, such as the Bill before us tonight. Either way, as a back bench Deputy who has recently successfully introduced an Act of the Oireachtas, the most obvious provision in this Bill which should be highlighted is the extension of entitlement to maternity benefit and maternity leave for mothers of children born prematurely beyond the 26 weeks already provided for. For me, this is yet another example of how the concept of new politics can work to deliver real change in Dáil Éireann for the people on the ground in our constituencies on issues which need to be addressed. With regard to this provision in particular, we all thought and agreed that this proposal, which originally came from the Green Party, made sense, was workable and affordable, had the support of families on the ground and was sensible to introduce. For that reason, I am delighted to see it included in the Bill. I firmly believe that good political ideas and good policies should be supported in parliament, regardless of who they come from. The concept of new politics has ended the prospect of fracking for shale gas and oil being permitted to occur in this country and it has now introduced this additional maternity cover for mothers who give birth prematurely. I believe that new politics will continue to deliver these changes, for however long it is permitted to continue. The Bill also provides for yet another positive measure aimed at supporting the transition from unemployment into employment by enabling the continuation of the back-to-work family dividend. The existing legislation had the effect of closing the scheme to new claimants from the end of March 2018 and the closure of the scheme in its entirety from 2021. This Bill will stop that closure and is part of the common sense approach to keeping people in the workplace and making work pay being taken by the Minister. I applaud her for this approach as many people in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim would have been affected by the original rule. The Bill continues the positive trend of increasing the levels of weekly social welfare payments, which will be a benefit to many pensioners, carers, jobseekers and people living with disabilities.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on the Social Welfare Bill 2017. In 2016, at the first opportunity I had, I raised the issue of the change in pension allowances introduced by Deputy Joan Burton in 2012. I know this was hotly debated last night and I think everybody that spoke in the Dáil raised this issue. There is an anomaly there. I know the Minister is genuine because I have heard her speak on this issue on numerous occasions. This is something which needs to be addressed as quickly as possible. I know there is a certain cost involved. These people had to give up work. In some cases they were forced to give up work. They had to rear children and whatever else and then had to go back into the workforce only to find that cruel changes to their pension entitlements had been introduced in 2012. It was especially cruel for a female Minister to introduce a rule which affected so many women. I know it is said that approximately 63% of those affected are women but I believe the percentage could be much higher than that. It is said that 38% of those affected are men but I do not know if that is correct either. Women definitely represent the higher percentage of those affected. I know the Minister is genuine in what she proposes to do, and the quicker it is done, the better. I would also like to raise the issue of the fair deal scheme. I know that it is not the Minister's brief but I would like to tell her of an experience I had on Monday morning. A constituent and her husband came into my office. She is close to 80 and her husband is in a nursing home. They are on non-contributory pensions. That is fine. They have no issue paying 80% of his pension for the scheme but there is an issue because this lady jointly owned a property with her two brothers, who were not married.One brother died and the surviving brother gave the farm to a nephew. The farm was valued at €120,000. Due to the fact that the lady was adjudged to own half of a farm worth €120,000, she is now paying 7.5% per year on top of the percentage of the pensions for her husband's care. That is an anomaly. I was shocked when she told me her story. The property she owns is of no benefit to her whatsoever and was passed on directly from her brother to their nephew. Because she is a joint owner of the property, she has to pay 7.5% of €62,000 out of her pension, which is very unfair. I acknowledge it is not under the Minister's brief but it needs to be looked at.

Those supplying care for others do a great job and there is no question about that. I was recently told of a girl who came back from England, where she was working, to look after her father who was very ill. She has no income here and applied for a carer's allowance and, unfortunately, was turned down. Her father is very ill and she is an only daughter and the only person available to care for him. She does not want to put her father into a nursing home although he would be entitled to be admitted to one. It is unfortunate that she has been refused that allowance and the refusal should be examined. I might come back to the Minister on that issue. Widows and widowers apply for pensions on the deaths of their partners and there are usually small children involved in such situations. The widow's pension is the poorest of all social protection payments. That should be looked at and increased because such people need more support, as is evidenced by such people who attend at Deputies' constituency offices. This is not a recent development but, rather, has been going on for the past 20 or 30 years. The widow's and widower's pension should be considered separately to social welfare payments. The payment for widows and widowers who have young children should be increased to try to help alleviate the difficulties that come with a death in the family. An issue raised last night is that of people who have to retire at the age of 65 when the current pension age is 66. As was said, the age of eligibility for the pension will rise to 67 or 68 for some people and there is very little interim support for those who have to retire at 65. Either the working age should be increased to allow people remain at work or a scheme should be brought in such that people are not put into poverty and there is something to help them during the years between retirement and becoming eligible for the pension. Following the economic crash, quite a number of self-employed people found themselves out of work and there was very little support for them. Things are gradually improving in that regard. However, the self-employed create jobs and pay PAYE, PRSI and the various other taxes that go with employing people, often amounting to thousands of euros, but when they get into difficulty, there is no help available for them. That is wrong. I appreciate that slight changes were made in the budget to help self-employed people who find themselves in difficult circumstances because of the recession or for other reasons. I come from a rural constituency and there were community welfare officers in the community until quite recently. Community welfare officers attended my home town of Ballymote and nearby places such as Glebe at least once a week and people went to those locations to meet them. Those officers have been taken out of rural areas and are now based in town centres and a person who wants to meet them has to do so at a certain time on a certain day. It can be difficult, in particular for single parents or families with young children, to make what could be a 40-mile round trip to meet them. Deputy McLoughlin will be aware of the issues involved in travelling from isolated places such as Glebe. Some people may have no private transport and there may be no public transport available and they would therefore have to hire a taxi to bring them to the meeting, which is very expensive. These services were removed during the recession but that should be reconsidered and community welfare officers put back into communities to help those in need and ensure it is easier for them to access the services required. Maintenance recovery is another issue of concern, although it may not come under the Minister's brief. It is of particular concern for separated mothers of young children. While a court as part of a separation settlement may award a sum of perhaps €50, €60 or €70 a week to a parent, in many cases the money does not make its way to where it should. The process to address that is very cumbersome because one has to go back to court, which could take two or three months, by which stage there could be a sum of €2,000 or €3,000 owing to the parent looking after the children of the marriage. That should be examined and, although it is not part of the Minister's brief, she could, perhaps, keep it in mind in the future.

It is constantly mentioned as being of necessity in order to deal with issues that have arisen or to improve things, no more so than during this afternoon's debate about the disclosures tribunal. As regards that issue, truth should be examined and guide us. The suppression of truth has us where we are in that regard. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is an example to other Departments in terms of the reform they need. If one tables a question or asks a question of officials in the Department one gets helpful answers. In addition, people are never transferred to different payments by the Department if those they are on give them the greatest amount of benefit. That has always been the case and long may it continue. In terms of the general output of the Department, one of the greatest difficulties is the length of time people have to wait while their applications are being processed. That is particularly so in regard to carer's allowance, whereby one puts in an application and it seems to be dealt with in an unusually lengthy process. It would be helpful if there were some way to shorten the process while also examining all aspects of the application. Domiciliary care allowance is another issue that needs to be dealt with. For many years there was a group based in Carlow that represented a number of people nationwide who had applied for domiciliary care allowance. It was known as the DCA Warriors and did battle with the Department to try to promote a better way of understanding domiciliary care allowance and dealing with applications. I will always remember looking at the application form for domiciliary care allowance in the United Kingdom. It is far simpler than that used here and an applicant knows exactly what is required and what circumstances need to be explained.I regularly meet constituents who are very upset that they have been refused despite all the professional opinion they have included with their applications. They are missing the point about setting out what has to be done over and above what one would do in respect, for example, of another child of the same age as the one being cared for. This could be overcome by a simple reform to the way in which the application form is structured and the type of information requested from the applicant. Debt collection is a regular topic at the Committee of Public Accounts. It led the Taoiseach into a bit of bother when he tried to explain it. We must get back to basics. It is the amount of debt incurred by someone who has, through error or fraud, taken money from the Department. If the Department stuck to that figure, it would be easily understandable. No one would get into trouble and everyone would know exactly how much was taken from the State. The Department should not introduce some other complex measurement of what might have been forgone to the State should something have happened. It is actual money about which we should be talking. If the position were tightened up in the context of the real fraud undertaken against the Department, the latter would have a significant amount of money. Fraud, by its very nature, is not easy to tie down. However, there are examples of fraud being detected and the same kind of method used to defraud the Department being in operation in other parts of the country. Resolving this would perhaps ensure more money for those in receipt of social welfare, particularly the elderly, and I ask the Minister to examine this. I have come across many cases recently of the elderly seemingly being targeted, which concerns me. I am talking about a generation of people who have lived a very frugal existence. As a result of the fact that they saved up their pension payments over the years, they did not declare having done so. This is part of what they saved and now, because they have these savings, which may be significant because many of them lived frugally, they are putting themselves outside of the means test at various points. The Department is now reclaiming that money, needless to say, in respect of the periods for which they were not qualified under a means test. We must be a little more sympathetic in such cases. This generation made efforts to save money and at times did not live very well. They wanted to save for their children, and now that money is being taken back from them. It is not that they deliberately misled the Department; they were planning for the next generation, and we should be sympathetic to those people. Some PPS numbers were issued in error. There are other cases in which the wife of someone who has been working requires a PPS number and it has taken a considerable length of time to issue. I have had to seek a PPS number in the past few weeks for my wife, who worked. The PPS number was apparently incorrect and now it will take five or six weeks to get the correct one. A number of such cases are in the system, and efforts should be made to clear the backlog if indeed there is one. I was self-employed for most of my life. We must bring about some imaginative scheme that will bring the self-employed into some form of cover. It was particularly evident during the crash that people who were self-employed as plasterers, carpenters and so on ended up with nothing and then had no social welfare supports. There is a need to introduce a scheme which, even if voluntary, would provide the range of supports that are necessary when someone hits such a wall. I came across a case recently of the breadwinner in a house - the father - becoming quite ill. The hoops that must be jumped through to get one's paperwork correct in order to get some form of payment is a little too much in certain circumstances. The circumstances of the individual should be determined in a far more efficient way when those circumstances concern medical issues, even though this will take some effort on the side of the social welfare official to determine the case. Taken nationally, I am sure there are many such cases, but these are just minor adjustments. They do not cost the State a fortune, and through savings within the Department over the years, something can be done for them. Finally, I wish to highlight the issue of rural crime and people, elderly individuals in particular, living alone. I know that alarm systems are in place but we need to expand the system we have into an organised one with a service provider to take in the greater number of people affected and ensure that those who live alone are covered and feel secure in their own homes. This could be direct contact with a neighbour or a police station. There is a need to support those who organise such alarms much more extensively. The principle and the basic supports are there but, because we now live in a very changing country, particularly in rural Ireland, there is a need to examine these schemes and have them dealt with in a way that is satisfactory for those who are in difficulty.

I outlined in the House the day after the budget that while the €5 increase in payments across the board is welcome, it does not take into account the expenses incurred by those with disabilities. Disability makes many things more expensive for the person with the disability than for someone who does not have a disability. Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, data show that the at-risk-of-poverty rates, poverty rates and deprivation rates of those with disabilities are all increasing. The obvious result of this is extreme poverty and social exclusion. Clearly, the additional costs associated with disability were not factored into the budget, and this creates huge hardships for the most vulnerable in our society. Again, I find myself standing before the Minister reiterating the fact that we are yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is despite our signing it in 2007. I brought this up with the Taoiseach under questions on promised legislation about a month ago, and he said the Government is just taking a different approach. It certainly is a different approach because while Ireland has not ratified the convention, every other EU country has ratified it. I was told this time last year by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, that Ireland would ratify it by the end of 2016, then he said it would be the end of 2017. Here we are nearly at the end of 2017 and it has still not been ratified. I would like the Minister to keep this in mind and speak to her colleagues about it. That we are now the only country in the EU not to have ratified the convention is not a statistic of which to be proud. Will the Government assure me, once and for all, that this will be attended to without further delay?People with disabilities are tired of being sidelined and denied a fair chance to participate in society on an equal footing. The inequity in the pensions system must be addressed, the first step being to reverse the changes introduced in 2012 and it must be done sooner rather than later. My constituency office is inundated with people presenting with their pension contributions history record, utterly perplexed to discover they will be penalised for giving up work to raise children or because they left Ireland to seek employment abroad when work was not available at home. The gap in their contributions history brought about by these necessary life choices is only brought to their attention when they request a contributions history from the Department. Many of them are approaching pension age when they make that inquiry, at which point it is almost impossible to remedy the shortfall. It is very harsh that, contrary to their expectations, they are discovering they are not entitled to a contributory pension. Although there are plans to move to a total contributions approach by 2020, that will do nothing to facilitate those who already find themselves in this predicament. We need clarity on their situation and action to remedy it.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I am glad the work of the House was not interrupted this week, which would have curtailed our debate on this important Bill. Fianna Fáil is happy to support the proposals contained in it as a step in the right direction towards our aim of creating a fairer Ireland for all, something to which my party has always aspired and always will aspire. We are proud of the role we played in securing the €5 increase in the State pension, in particular, as well as the increases in other weekly payments and the qualified child payment. We welcome, too, the extension of maternity benefit and leave in cases of premature birth. I hope it will give some comfort to parents who find themselves in that very difficult situation. The major deficiency in the Bill, as referred to by my colleague, is that it does not address the issue of pension inequality, which is having a devastating effect on older people, especially older women. While we are having this discussion, some of the women concerned are gathered outside these buildings to protest against a system that absolutely disadvantages those among them who took time out of the workforce to engage in childminding duties or care for elderly parents. I look forward to joining them as soon as I have finished my contribution. Financial hardship in retirement has become a real problem for women because of the way the current system is structured. A 2012 study by the European Institute for Gender Equality found that the pension pay gap between men and women amounted to almost €700 a month. In fact, only 16% of women in this country receive the full State pension. I have repeatedly raised this matter in the House, having heard from so many women in Kildare South who are distraught to learn on reaching retirement age that they are not entitled to a full pension. It is very difficult for people who have been looking forward to a secure retirement to discover that they will, in fact, be facing into financial hardship. The changes introduced in 2012 must be reversed immediately. The 36,000 people affected by the new system cannot wait until 2020 for the matter to be resolved, but we are still waiting for the report on this issue promised by the Minister. The inequity of the gendered pension system must be addressed without delay. Patrick Kavanagh, whose 50th anniversary we marked recently, got it right when a character in one of his novels observed: "Women ... never have got full credit for their bravery. They sacrifice everything to life." We need to move towards a universal pension system which will give men and women equal access to a comprehensive pension guarantee that will provide a decent standard of living for all. Other than the €5 increase in all welfare payments, there is little good news in the Bill for those with a disability. There was an excellent presentation today in the Leinster House audio-visual room on what the census data told us about of the lives of people with disabilities. Their numbers are growing, as are the levels of supports needed. The large number of people with disabilities who cannot access education or employment and are totally reliant on the State is a clear indication that we need to do more to assist them. The Government, however, has failed to introduce a cost of disability top-up payment to address the additional costs faced by those with a disability, leaving the disability community feeling they have, once again, been ignored and sidelined. The at-risk poverty rate for people not at work owing to illness or disability was 34.8% in 2015, compared to 25.2% in 2014. That is a very worrying statistic. In October the Taoiseach acknowledged the many shortcomings and problems in the funding of disability services and indicated that spending priorities for disability services would have to form part of the budget and Estimates process. He expressed confidence that additional funding for disability services would be found next year. The 643,000 people with disabilities and their families need and deserve clarity on what the additional funding will be and how it will be found. It is time for action instead of rhetoric.  The Government has yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability, despite having signed up to it in 2007. This is now the only country in Europe in which ratification of the convention remains outstanding. That should be a source of shame in this Chamber. I am happy to support the Bill before us, while recognising that it represents only minor progress on the path to justice and equality for all groups on the island. If real opportunity is to be offered to all citizens, investment must be targeted at those who have been left behind and marginalised in the past. We cannot let that inequity continue.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I will begin by acknowledging the positive changes, some of which are included as a consequence of the confidence and supply agreement between my party and Fine Gael in government. I will refer later to provisions that might be considered for inclusion in future budgets or perhaps even next year if it transpires that there is additional capacity within the Department. The €5 per week increase for pensioners is most welcome and important. Older people have worked all their lives and it is vital that they be protected in retirement. This increase, together with the increase provided for in this year's budget, sends an important signal about our priorities. The increase of €5 in all social welfare payments is also welcome. It will make a particular difference to lone-parent families, many of whom are struggling. The extension of maternity benefit to families with premature babies is another positive change. As the father of a child who was premature, it is especially welcome to me, as reflected in my contribution to the debate on the Private Members' Bill that passed through the House. The Christmas bonus will be restored at a rate of 85% this year. We must seek to move, as soon as possible, towards a situation where it will be restored at the rate of 100%, particularly for all pensioners who have contributed greatly to the State all of their lives.Hopefully, those people will have many years in which to enjoy the bonus. The restoration of the telephone allowance was a measure I called for and it is very welcome. The negative aspect of this is that it is going to be late and will not be implemented until next year. However, it is better late than never. It is very important for pensioners, whether they are living alone or with their partners. For most of them, it means two things, namely, it gives them contact with people outside their homes and removes the isolation and, more importantly, allows for them to feel secure through having access to panic buttons, panic alarms, etc. Many pensioners and older people have had to do without this allowance so I welcome the fact that it is being restored. I had called for this to happen in recent months. We want to extend the allowance to all pensioners, irrespective of their circumstances, as quickly as possible. It is important for all pensioners that they have access to the allowance. How the fuel allowance is paid is also positive because it will help people who are struggling. I wanted to acknowledge these positives in the Bill as a backdrop for consideration of other matters in the period ahead. As the economy and the position of the Exchequer improve, it will be important to have reviews in order that additional funding, when it becomes available, can be channelled in the right direction in order to help those who are most vulnerable and struggling. To that end, I wish to address the issue of child benefit. During my 20 short months in the Dáil, I have met the Minister's predecessor - the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - on two or three occasions to discuss this matter. I have also raised it as on Topical Issues. Child benefit should be extended to students who are in full-time second-level education. With the advent of transition year, which comes two years before the leaving certificate, most students can be in full-time second-level education until the age of 18 or 18 and a half. It is the final year in second-level education that can affect families greatly because it is leaving certificate year and can be very expensive. Extending child benefit to those over 18 and still in second-level education was costed by the Department, at my request. Such a measure would cost €55 million. The dynamics may have changed in the interim but it would be worth considering my proposal again. At the time, the then Minister acknowledged that such a measure would be positive. He acknowledged on national radio that we should consider doing this. It has not been done and it was not factored in to the budget. We should consider it because it would help struggling families a lot, is really important and would make a difference. A child in his or her final year at school needs support. As a result of the fact that he or she started school at an earlier age, a person could be in receipt of child benefit while his or her fellow students may not. That is something of an inequity. I would ask the Minister to consider this issue. I also ask the Minister to consider the matter of the bereavement grant, particularly as it affects people who may be in receipt of social welfare payments or pensions. I am aware that they can get some supports from community welfare officers through the provision of supplementary welfare payments. Obviously, however, those payments do not go anywhere close to what may be required. I ask the Minister to also give consideration to this issue. Rather than revisit a raft of issues already covered by previous speakers, I shall just focus on a few. An issue regarding the jobseeker's payment has come up a lot at my clinics in the recent weeks. If a person is in and out of casual work and then applies for the jobseeker's allowance, he or she is not paid for the first three days of the claim. That has been the case for years but it is now a disincentive and a negative aspect. If a person is offered work for a couple of weeks and then goes back to claim jobseeker's allowance for a week or two or vice versa, he or she will not be paid for the first three days of the claim. This is a lot in a five or ten-day window. People who are in temporary or casual contracts can be laid off and when they go back into the environment of the jobseeker's system while waiting for more work to come along, losing three days from a six-day payment has a great impact. Could consideration be given to this matter? I know that it is not relevant to the Bill but I thought I might take the opportunity to highlight people's concerns in order that we might discover what could be done by the Minister's officials. Reference was made to the pensions anomaly. From working with my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, I am aware that the Minister is very open-minded on this, is working positively to address the anomaly that was introduced in 2012 and that she is trying to correct it. If I understand the position correctly, there is a commitment to the effect that if there is any available flexibility within the budget for next year, the Minister will consider what might be done and that something will definitely be considered in the context of the budget for 2019. This is important because it has become an issue for Deputies at their clinics in the past six to eight months. Women who are reaching retirement age are only realising the significance of the 2012 change now. Most people will be unaware of it until they submit their applications. This important issue must be dealt with comprehensively and in a positive manner. We need to support families that took the decision for a parent to stay at home, which was a good decision for the right reasons. They should not be penalised. In the time remaining, I wish to refer to Tús schemes. I have spoken to the Minister about this on numerous occasions and she responded very positively. I am aware that there is a bigger picture regarding Tús and community employment schemes, both of which are massively important. The Minister and her officials, who I have met in the Department, acknowledge that flexibility will be introduced to those schemes. The Minister is considering doing this in early 2018. We know what the level of unemployment is right now, and the levels of employment equivalent, and when a Tús scheme placement is vacated after one year there is no one else coming through. We have acknowledged this and followed the path through the Department to show that the lists of people to interview to fill those vacancies are not coming through to the Tús supervisors. There are a number of losers in this situation. The real loser is the individual who may be at a particular stage in his or her life whereby he or she may not get full-time work again. I am not being discriminatory when I say that. The club will also lose out. It suffers because nobody is coming in to fill the space. The third loser is the community because there is a seriously negative impact. When we consider the host, the participant and the community collectively, we can see that there is a major deficit. This needs to be addressed by allowing some flexibility. If a Tús participant finishes his or her year, he or she should not have to vacate and the year should be rolled on. Obviously, this requires a change to the Department policy or the legislation to actually make that happen. For some people, the scheme provides a social element to their lives when they go out to work for 20 hours per week. Apart from the benefits and the worthwhile service they give to the community and the group, it may be the only interaction they have because they may live alone. There are a number of avenues and angles upon which I would like to see the Minister's commitment followed through as per the discussions we have had. The Minister said that she would bring in that flexibility in 2018 and I would like to see this happen in order to help in these areas, which are of great benefit.

for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill 2017 and to address a number of issues. There are many people involved in the area of social welfare. Much has been made in the Bill about the benefits for self-employed people. This is particularly relevant after the 2008 crash, when many self-employed people applied for social welfare benefits but discovered that they were outside the system. They could not get social welfare and had to go through a means test. The S stamp was not of any real benefit to them. People right across the spectrum have raised concerns on this issue for a long time. The invalidity pension that is proposed within the scope of this Bill for self-employed people has a clause which states clearly that they will be eligible only if they cease trading. If one considers the working conditions of those involved in agriculture and for small traders, there are many issues, such as workplace accidents and so on, that arise. If, for example, a farmer is injured or has a serious illness and the farm is means of obtaining a livelihood for the family, then the wife or spouse will continue to work the farm - perhaps with some outside help. The farm is down in income because the farmer has been injured and is incapacitated. How will we allow this farmer to get his or her invalidity pension if the clause states that he or she must cease trading? Perhaps the Minister could look at the clause in question before the next occasion on which the Bill comes before the House.It will make it very difficult, if not impossible, for some businesses and self-employed persons, whether in the production of fruit and vegetables, farming or a small business in which a spouse is also working. If other family members are working in the business and the PRSI number of the person who is injured or incapacitated is used as the main number for the business, he or she will not receive an invalidity pension where he or she would otherwise qualify for the simple reason that there is this clause, unless he or she ceases to trade. I ask the Minister to have a real look at it. She should look at the terms because it will definitely undo a lot of the good that has been promised in the introduction of invalidity pension for self-employed persons. Another issue with which I want to deal relates to community employment scheme supervisors. I understand there was a meeting last Thursday with the Department, the Labour Court and other interested parties in that regard. Community employment scheme supervisors have been employed, but the issues involved are technical. It is said they were employed by the sponsors of a scheme and they now face a situation where there is no pension for them. It was understood there would be a pension because they were paying into a scheme but there was none through FÁS as it was or SOLAS as it is now. The Minister might tell the House about the meeting that was held last Thursday and set out the thinking involved. Certainly, there have been various commitments in the past six or seven years, including in the programme for Government, that an accommodation would be reached for these supervisors. While I am talking about community employment, one of the biggest difficulties involves people who are 62 to 64 years of age who have finished their time on schemes. This is a long-running issue and every case should be made on these schemes. There is a lot of therapeutic work which benefits both society and the participants and consideration should be given to extending participation in schemes right up to pension age. This should be considered across the board, given the enormous benefit everyone has received. There has been a debate back and forth in the Chamber on PRSI and pension records. I thank the Minister for the reply she gave to a parliamentary question last Thursday. There was a huge difficulty, as I know from many negotiations with senior officials in the Department. Now public representatives can look for records. When people are approaching their 60s and want to look at their records to see if they will be entitled to a pension, they do not know how to interface with the Department. They do not want to set up online accounts and provide all of those details. I am glad that the Department has seen sense and that we will be able to get the records. The people concerned will also be able to obtain the records themselves; they will not just have to use the offices of public representatives. They will be able to contact the Department directly. This was about finding a way to obtain private information held by the Department for which people should look. It is very worthwhile and I appreciate it. We put a great deal of effort into trying to have the position changed. Issues also arise regarding branch offices. Negotiations are ongoing. No more than any other infrastructure in rural or urban Ireland, we need to maintain the branch offices, just as we need to maintain post offices. A report was issued yesterday which stated responsibility for television licence fee collection should be handed over to Revenue, which would be a detrimental step. We need to channel as much business as humanly possible to post offices. Since I entered the House, people have been talking about getting all of the business of the State into post offices. In that regard, this is a retrograde recommendation, but I digress. To return to social welfare issues, an agreement on branch offices must be put in place rapidly. I ask the Minister to outline to the House how matters in that regard are being progressed. The rural social scheme has benefited many families in the 15 years since its introduction and the introduction of the farm assist scheme. Many farmers' spouses joined the scheme and improved their skills enormously. They learned computer skills, worked with local development companies and went on to find employment through the scheme. People in my area have benefited enormously from it. Therefore, the scheme is very worthwhile. However, there is some confusion about it and who is entitled to benefit from it. If a farmer has a low income and participating in the farm assist scheme, he and his family are entitled to benefit from the rural social scheme. If a farmer has a dependent wife or child who is in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, the wife or child can take part in the rural social scheme. There seems to be some confusion about how the scheme is being implemented. I hope there is no attempt being made from on high to remove the scheme, given its enormous benefits. People who have been trying to join Tús or community employment schemes participate in rural social scheme programmes which give them a sense of worth and on which they work very well. I ask for a full breakdown of what happens when a herd number and a single farm or basic payment application is made within a family and someone is in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. As I understand it, a person can join the scheme in these circumstances. I know that it is difficult to fill Tús scheme places because of the employment figures but there should be more encouragement in that regard. I have a real issue with JobPath. According to the Department's own statistics, a lot of people who have been participating in JobPath have ended up in receipt of disability allowance or disability benefit. I do not know whether there is a trend, but the JobPath programme has certainly come to the end of its usefulness. People are not progressing in the way intended when the programme was designed. While there is a major issue with JobPath, I encourage greater participation in community employment and rural social schemes. Many colleagues have spoken about the change in women's pension entitlements on foot of the 2012 Act. It is one of the biggest issues. In the newsletters I have sent during the years I have always encouraged people to check their records to ensure they are up to date on all parts of their work history. Women are having €35 to €50 cut from their pension payments each week because they took time out to provide a valuable service for the State by rearing families. It is predominantly an issue which affects women, but it is also a problem for some men, particularly farmers. They would have worked away from the farm in their earlier years and then became self-employed farmers in the 1970s and 1980s, right up to 1988 when PRSI contributions became compulsory for the self-employed. They are now looking at the non-availability of the contributory pension. The ten-year rule was in place heretofore. I know some people who worked in the sugar factory in Mallow in their earlier years and who then worked on their farms. By the time the calculation is made, they are out of money or debarred completely. If they had never worked in their earlier years, the averages would have been a lot better. There is an issue which must be looked at. Information was provided that it was being tackled and that an agreement was being made between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Finance.That does not seem to be the situation now. There needs to be a coherent, concerted attempt to resolve this issue, which predominantly affects women and a certain category of men. It is discrimination, pure and simple. Social welfare has saved many families. Whether through the supplementary welfare scheme or whatever, it fills the breach in difficult cases. Social welfare workers use great discretion and have been more than good in trying to help families. However, there are situations where, for example, the top-up on the SUSI grant cannot be paid because the family receives family income supplement. I know a man who had been working and receiving family income supplement but who, when he was injured and off work and receiving illness benefit, could not get the supplement. He is now outside the limit needed to qualify for the SUSI top-up grant. There are serious anomalies that need to be resolved. I would like a comprehensive reply on the Department's thinking about the rural social scheme. I urge the Minister to reconsider the invalidity pension for the self-employed because, while I understand that there is a strong intention in the Department to help those who are self-employed, there is a clause in the Bill which will debar the majority of those who would need it.

A farmer does not need to have cattle to get a single farm payment but he or she could get someone in to cut the grass and sell the bales and thereby be entitled to an invalidity pension. For years, the Department encouraged people to go to banks more so than to post offices to conduct their business. The post office might be the only place where someone would see elderly people on a Friday. I encourage the Department, wherever it can do so, to promote and help post offices. The extra numbers for the rural social scheme are welcome. The work done on those schemes throughout the country is invaluable. The Tidy Towns committees, Tús and CE schemes do massive work because county councils do not have workers to keep small towns tidy. The schemes ensure that people on small farms remained viable and gave them an existence. Unfortunately, people of 62 or younger who have been on the schemes for several years are being told they must head for the hills. This work was good for their mental health. Will the Minister and the officials do something for these people? In many places, the schemes advertise for people and do not get anyone to fill the vacancies. On the one hand, that is good because more people are at work but, on the other, next year the Tidy Towns competitions, the schools and graveyards, where those on the rural social scheme did incredible work for the fabric of life in rural Ireland, may lose out. There may be problems in some areas where the council and those who operate the rural social scheme are arguing about insurance. They should tease that matter out because we want the work to be done. In the past year, this has caught up with us. I do not admire some of the schemes for getting people back to work but Tús and CE are doing massive work. We know the councils do not have the staff. My Christmas wish is that the Minister try to sort that out for the new year because it would give a new lease of life to many communities that do Trojan work to make their towns look better.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	I welcome the Social Welfare Bill 2017 and the measures the Minister is introducing. I have a few small issues which, like everything to do with social welfare, have a big impact on people's lives. I echo what Deputy Moynihan said about the invalidity pension. I welcome it as very good news. I thank the Minister for bringing it in. Everybody wanted to do it and I congratulate this Minister on being the one to do it. Deputy has mentioned some people who will miss out. There are others who became sick in recent years, who are still out of work and who have full stamps and would have qualified for this pension last year or the year before but who will not qualify this year. There may be a small cohort of people in that boat and I urge the Minister to consider them. One is a constituent of mine and the Minister's. She has contacted the Minister's office and has spoken on national radio about this issue. I thank the woman in question, Martina Kelly, for her work in highlighting this two years ago when she became very ill. I urge the Minister to consider the people to whom I refer. I am sure there are very few of them. They are at home sick and would qualify for the invalidity pension if this provision had been introduced last year or the year before.It would be reasonable to grandfather the provision, as one might say, as medical records could be obtained to prove people are ill and cases would not be made up. I welcome this. It is a positive step forward, but I urge the Minister to examine the position again in order to discover what might be the implications of extending the provision to those to whom I refer. We look forward to the forthcoming increases in social welfare payments. I would prefer if they were greater but, obviously, there are huge competing pressures in the context of the budget. It is important that we say to everybody that they have a place in society and this is a country that looks after people, from those on the lowest incomes to the people on the highest. The Bill gives legislative effect to the range of increases in social welfare benefits. I want to mention the people, predominantly women, who have lost their expectation of what their pensions would be because of changes introduced in 2012 and which we on this side of the House voted against at the time. What was done has given rise to a huge injustice. I note the Minister's commitment to rectifying the position and I look forward to action being taken to have the matter resolved. What we are speaking about are legitimate expectations. We had all sorts of debates about politicians' and judges' pensions and there were various constitutional blocks as to why somebody's pension could not be touched if it was a public sector occupational pension. If those constitutional blocks are there, I cannot see why they are not there in respect of people's social welfare's pensions. Women in particular, some of whom are outside the House this evening, do not have the same legitimate expectation they had when they paid their stamps - at whatever level was required at the time - regarding the size of the pensions they will receive. I fully recognise that JobPath is crucial to activate people into the workforce and ensure that individuals who could be working but who are not receive the training and help they need to get into employment. I am fully on board with this. Deputy Moynihan recognised that there are certain people who should probably be on disability allowance because they are simply not fit to work. There are very few in this particular group, but I certainly know two gentlemen who are and who live in rural areas. One is in his late 50s and the other is in his early 60s. Neither has ever driven. They cycle around their rural parishes. The JobPath activation is proving a tremendous burden on them. Some people have to get taxis to the nearest town in order to avail of it, which is a huge imposition. While we recognise that it is very important to ensure we get value for money in the context of social welfare, it is also important to recognise that category of people who, for whatever reason, have never worked a day in their lives, probably because they have not been able to do so and perhaps they never applied for disability allowance or were never guided towards it. I do not think many people would consider them to be availing of social welfare to which they are not entitled. These people live pretty basic lives in rural society. I welcome that the Bill will pass before Christmas as a result of the fact that an election has not been called. The increases are due to come into effect shortly thereafter. We on this side of the House will be invoking the confidence and supply agreement to allow the Bill to be passed and the Government to get on with its work on this and other issues.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	352	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Often on Second Stage, Deputies can, perhaps, meander from the essential provisions of legislation when they speak. However, I presume and hope that the purpose of this type of debate will not be stymied as we become more strict in interpretations of what the Dáil can and cannot do. The Bill will give legislative effect to the changes announced in the budget. There are some inherent inequalities that we have to accept and address. As a society, we are beginning to abandon tranches of people. This is not the result of any malicious design on the part of Government or otherwise, but we are leaving cohorts of people behind. If we do not accept that, we will end up with a very unequal society. Instead of wealth filtering down, we have a situation where wealth is, by osmosis, going upwards. We have to accept this urgently and address it in a very rapid timeframe. The reason I highlight this is that if we look at the issue of lone parents and child poverty, there is still a huge poverty trap in many of the schemes supporting lone parents to get them back into education and the workplace. People encounter difficulties in trying to move from various stages of schemes back into the workplace. In this regard, I refer, for example, to the cap on the hours they are allowed to work, traps in education and difficulties with child care costs and facilities being provided. All of these create huge poverty traps and cliff edges whereby, when they move off schemes, people fear losing their entitlements and secondary benefits. If we do not take imaginative approaches to this, there will be a huge cohort of people who will feel totally alienated from a functioning society and we will simply cast adrift another generation of young people in socioeconomically deprived areas. This, in itself, would be a betrayal of our citizens. I am a bit tired of the State at times absolving itself from responsibilities and the onus it should have, which is to protect its citizens, not only in the context of security but also in aspects of educational attainment, housing and social welfare provision, and giving people a sense of hope and aspiration. We need to address this very quickly. The Taoiseach has spoken about representing the people who get up early in the morning. They are as entitled to be represented as anybody else. Language is very important, however, and insinuating this creates division. The last thing we need in society is for us to start pitting one group or cohort against another. The Taoiseach may not be doing this intentionally. It may just be the basis of his political ideology that the person who gets up early in the morning and works should be prioritised. People who get up in the morning and work should be rewarded for their efforts. Ultimately, wealth comes from those who generate it, namely, businesses that employ and people who work. Not everybody can get up early in the morning, however, and there is a huge group of people who simply feel completely removed from any chance of entering the workplace because of all of the poverty traps and obstacles that are put in front of them. It may be intergenerational - in the sense that they have poor educational outcomes or are in poor housing as a result of living in poverty - and they just cannot escape the net that sometimes keeps people at the very bottom. It is not that the majority of people on social welfare do not want to get up and go to work. There are many challenges in terms of their educational standards and the opportunities that present to people with those difficulties. Rather than trying to be divisive, let us move to the centre where we try to get everybody feeling they are part and worthy of political representation, and that they ought to be cared for equally. As already stated, child poverty is endemic in our society. We have a major problem. We either pretend it does not exist or there is an idea that increasing lone parents' allowance and social welfare payments by a few cents here and there is acknowledging it. We may be acknowledging the problem, but we are doing very little to address the inherent difficulties in society that end up with a huge number of people in child poverty. A total of 11.5% of children were in consistent poverty in 2015 compared to 12.7% in 2014. Approximately one in nine children lives in consistent poverty. This is not something we should be proud of in 2017, when we speak about the country's economic recovery. These children grow up, and if they are in consistent poverty as children, the chances are they will find it very difficult to break out of that trap, so they will be in consistent poverty not only as children but potentially into their teens and beyond. We have to start breaking these cycles at a very early age. Do I have solutions? I would like to think we can come up with imaginative ideas to address this, but one thing I know for sure is that if we do not break intergenerational poverty, we are failing. Family income supplement has been changed to the working family payment. When this was being done, we were hopeful that the scheme - not just the name - might change. It has not been an imaginative change. I hope that the working family payment is an initial step. We must deal with the poverty traps and the perverse disincentives - not the perverse incentives - that often exist. Those disincentives stop people from making the leap to the next phase in terms of the number of hours worked and losing secondary benefits when they move up in income, when there is a definite cliff fall. That area must be examined. In 2012, there was a change in how we assess pensions with the introduction of the averaging system. That has had huge ramifications for women in particular. That has been acknowledged but the situation must be addressed. It is simply unfair and unjust to have a situation whereby women who have worked and then remained at home to rear children, as was society's expectation at the time and also an obligation under some statute law, are penalised for that on reaching retirement age. They are being penalised for doing what they were asked to do. If we do not accept that it is unjust and unfair, we are failing a cohort of people who have served this country with some distinction and are not being rewarded for it. There is an acknowledgement that it must be addressed, but this must be done in a way that accepts that what is being done to these women is wrong and unjust, that there will be redress and that the matter will be resolved. They did what was asked of them in the context of the expectations of society at the time and even under employment law in terms of women having to leave certain forms of employment when they married. With regard to the number of children who are in some form of emergency accommodation tonight and who will be in such accommodation over the Christmas period, we do not appear to accept that we are failing in certain areas. While we acknowledge that there is economic recovery, I believe we do not put enough emphasis on dealing with the real issues that will define our society and give the individual an opportunity to advance themselves and their family and to maximise their potential. Being housed in a hotel room is certainly not a great start for a child. The fact that there are thousands of children in emergency accommodation across the capital on any night is an abject failure of policymakers of all hues and none. We have simply failed. The idea is that we can wait for rapid builds, for the banks to start lending to developers and for the developers to start building houses. There must be dynamic, imaginative policy changes that obligate local authorities to use compulsory purchase orders, if necessary, and provide funding for immediate building. A child of four years of age cannot wait for five years in a hotel bedroom, by which time he or she will be nine years old. The damage will be done to the child if he or she is in such a position. Not many of us are in emergency accommodation on any night, nor are many of the major policymakers in the Departments or many of the county or city managers. We have failed. It is an abject failure of catastrophic proportions that a country with a quite smart and dynamic people cannot build the number of units required to get the people who are in emergency accommodation into some form of permanent housing. We are talking about thousands of people, not tens of thousands. They are living in bedrooms, sharing a kettle in the same place where they sleep. It is simply wrong, but nobody appears to take a blind bit of notice. I urge a redoubling of the effort on building houses, as opposed to the amazing effort that goes into convincing us that houses are being built. There have been far more press releases than policy documents. Every day there is another press release about how dynamic the building programme is, how the Government is getting on with the job of building houses, how there will be more social housing and all that flows from that. When one drills down into the figures, however, one sees that very little is being done, to the point that in some local authorities one can count the number of houses they have built over the last three years on one hand. It is an abject failure. We should recommit ourselves - both Government and Parliament - to facing into 2018 with vigour and determination in order that we might re-energise ourselves to ensure that the policy decisions that are made will result in houses being built and proper accommodation being provided for families who are currently in emergency accommodation. It will require some radical shifts and changes in thinking among policy makers and the Government, but it is essential. There is a belief that we have fulfilled our obligations and done enough as a society by putting people in hotel bedrooms. We have not. We have failed them. In a previous time, when the State had no capacity to fund itself and build, we were able to roll out massive building programmes across the country. Some of them resulted in social problems, but we can surely learn from the mistakes of that time in terms of house design, layout of estates and supports around them. Surely we have the capacity to do something similar in terms of a large scale house building programme funded by public funds and, if necessary, by private funds if the State cannot fund it directly because it is inhibited from doing so due to certain budget restrictions. There is access to money. Money has never been so cheap. We are retarding the State's ability to build critical infrastructure in many sectors, primarily housing, at a time when access to money internationally has never been cheaper in recent history. Let us be imaginative and redouble our efforts. The Government should at least accept that if we are still here at the end of 2018 and there are still thousands of children - all a year older - living in hotel bedrooms and emergency accommodation, it is a sign that we are failing and certainly failing them.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	I do not agree with my colleague on the Opposition benches regarding housing. In fact, a great deal has already been done and is being done every day. It was the neglect of the local authority housing sector over the past 15 years that has left us in this situation. When housing responsibility was handed to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to fund it by way of rent support through the private sector, it suddenly all came unstuck. We now have a national emergency of proportions we never dreamed of in the past. I will not level blame. When I hear this matter being moaned about regularly, however, it is time to take a stand. At least one former Minister with responsibility for social welfare made an attempt to offload the responsibility back to where it should have been with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but was unsuccessful. She had the right idea. The point is, however, at long last perhaps we are coming to grips with the fact that we have a social responsibility in respect of housing, that it affects the fabric of our society, that we must provide houses and that we cannot provide them overnight. If we wanted to provide them overnight we should have started this ten or 15 years ago. We should also acknowledge that there were huge numbers of people on the housing lists of local authorities during the boom. The fact is that because there was a boom, we did not need the houses. However, they are needed now.Enough has been said about that matter which we will deal with, with other subjects, at a later stage.  I welcome the increase in social welfare payments. It is badly needed and much appreciated because many of the people who have found themselves having to rely entirely on the safety net of social welfare payments in the past few years are living in desperate conditions. Some were PAYE workers, while others were self-employed, but they have one thing in common - they are under the cosh. At last, some recompense is coming their way and I am delighted that that is the case. I must point out that if we did not have good management in the past five or six years, we would not have the money now. Therefore, these things do not happen of their own accord. Everybody says we should spend more on everything. Of course, we should, but we must also raise the money needed to do so. It is all very fine and easy to spend the cash, but it is not so easy to raise it and take the responsibility of asking people to make contributions by way of taxes or whatever the case may be. I listened with some cynicism to some of the suggestions I have heard made in the past couple of days in that regard.  The issue of pensions is moot and needs to be dealt with. I know that the Minister is dealing with it. Having had some experience in that area a number of years ago, it is possible to deal with it in a fair and equitable way, which is what must be done. A previous Government lurched in one direction to try to deal with it; for what purpose, I do not know as it escapes me, but it was not successful in that it created anomalies and a huge bill. I do not want to remind my good friend across the House, but there are times when I am stirred emotionally by his rapport and know that he means it sincerely in his heart. It is no harm, therefore, to throw the ball back in that direction once again.  Women who, for various reasons, left the workforce and then returned to it have a grievance, as do some men who find themselves in the same position, and they need to be dealt with. I know that the Minister is addressing the issue. We need to recognise the unfairness of it. The reason it is unfair is we are entering better times. Because of the sacrifices they made all over the country, it will be possible in the not too distant future to address their issues and concerns in a meaningful way.  A few points about administration have come to my attention. Means tests have been the bane of my life. With appeals, they really drive me up the wall, particularly when I have to attend the hearing of appeals. Generally, a person wins, which raises the question as to why there had to be an appeal in the first place. The decisions in aninordinately high number of applications for carer's allowance are appealed. This should not be the case. I saw something a couple of weeks ago which involved a person who wished to care for their parents, one of whom was 89 years old, while the other was 94. I would have thought that it would have been simple to determine. I would not have spent too much time in evaluating the person's entitlement. If someone has managed to reach the age of 93 or 94 years, he or she is entitled to expect to receive some care from somebody who is willing to care for him or her and prevent him or her from having to rely on the hospital system. Obviously, it is good economics to examine their circumstances and put in place the necessary measures to ensure he or she will be catered for and it could involve a variety of things. It involves issues to do with security, health and companionship, plus quality of life. I know that the Minister is looking at this matter, but we need to encourage such an approach.  Another issue that has come to my attention and about which I worry is where Intreo decides to encourage people to go back to work on low pay. Such persons may be dependent on rent payment support. If they go back to work on low pay, they will receive little or no rent payment support because they will be back in full-time employment, in which case they will end up homeless. This issue needs to be dealt with quickly because those who find themselves in that group need to have their cases heard.  Another issue that does not amuse me is where a woman with children who cannot go out to work and receives a limited payment is advised to go to out to work. The logic escapes me. This issue has been on my mind for some time and I brought it to the attention of the Minister who is engaging on it. What I have highlighted should not be happening. We should apply a little logic to such circumstances. Obviously, the person concerned can care for somebody in the household, nearby or next door and always wants to do so. She always wants to make a contribution to society. That is what women do, but it does not always happen in that way. Because of this, we need to be conscious of their predicament and alert to the fact that they are vulnerable, particularly if they have small children, and dependent on the safety net society provides for them.  The House will be glad to know that I will not go on for as long as I would like. There are lots of things my colleague across the House stirred in my bosom when he spoke a few moments ago. They would tempt me to enter into a long dialogue, but I will restrain myself on this occasion.

We are lucky to have escaped from the terrible trauma we went through in the past six or seven years. It was just appalling. The people were under the cosh for all of that time - those living in urban and rural areas, young children, older people, everybody. They are now getting the first sample of recompense. I hope they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their endeavours and hard labour and that we will be able to treat them with some respect after all they have gone through.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions on Second Stage in the past couple of days. I will take up a point made by Deputy Bernard J. Durkan about the people who have gone through the greatest trauma in the past six or seven years. Some have still not recovered, which is why when I opened the debate last Thursday, I spoke about how I hoped the Bill reflected the values and principles that underpinned the budget in its entirety. We will continue to enhance the supports for those who rely on what comes from my Department. Equally, we will ensure anybody who goes out to work sees the value of that work and the difference in lifestyle they have by being in employment as opposed to being supported by the Department. We are going to do that in the context of the overarching commitment to enable the development of a recovering economy. In response to Deputy Billy Kelleher, I hope it will not be in the interests of some citizens only but in the interests of all citizens. While I appreciate that many of the Deputies who spoke in the past couple of days have recognised that there are some positive measures in the Bill, to use somebody's phrase, "there is a lot done but there is an awful lot more to do". I will respond on a few issues raised by Deputies in the past couple of days. The first is the 2012 pensions issue which I think was raised by everybody who spoke in the past couple of days. I acknowledge the 200 pensioners who stood outside the gates of Leinster House this evening. Unfortunately, I did not get out to meet them because I was in the Chamber, but I acknowledge their presence.I respect the reasons they were standing outside the door and pay tribute to Deputy Bríd Smith who probably organised them and the speakers who spoke on their behalf to come out. I thank her for that. I spoke last Thursday at the joint committee on this issue. As I have said on a number of occasions, we are examining in depth the various options to provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the bands not been amended in 2012. If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were particularly affected by this anomaly under the yearly averaging system, I will bring those options to our Cabinet sub-committee in the next couple of weeks where we will discuss the best proposal to fix this before I bring it to Cabinet. Deputies talk about the large number of women who are affected by this anomaly. Everybody seems to have a different reason there was a large number of women affected by it but it is not just women. I do not want us to discount the women who are affected but there are quite a considerable number of men affected by it too. This woman, and this particular Minister, has already made a commitment to fix it. I reiterate that commitment. I acknowledge, as hopefully everybody does, that it will require new money. I do not have the money in this Social Welfare Bill but we will fix it and we will find the money in the course of the next 12 months, if not sooner.  I will talk about child poverty because the consistent level of poverty among children has been raised by a number of Deputies in this debate. It is something I have mentioned on a number of occasions since I was lucky enough to get this job in June, because it is a priority. It is a priority for every side and every party and representative in the House. There are some positive, albeit small, signs and they are going in the right direction. The latest CSO figures show that 11.5% of our children are living in consistent poverty. While that is unacceptably high, it is a reduction of approximately 9%, or 13,000 children, since last year. The real reason I take solace in that is because it is the first decrease since 2008. It means that some of the changes we made in last year's budget are having an impact. Everybody acknowledges there are far more changes with regard to children in this budget than there were last year. We are seeing a drop in the figures so hopefully we will see a much larger drop between now and next year. The monthly unemployment rate in October was 6%, which is down from a 2012 peak of 15%. Unemployment is strongly linked to poverty so further decreases in poverty will arise from the reduction in unemployment figures. It can also be expected that the measures introduced in the interim will have a positive impact. In 2018, the qualified child increase, which will be paid on a weekly basis, will rise from €29.80 to €31.80, which is an increase of 6.7%. While I acknowledge it is only small, it is something that has not been increased in nearly eight years. While we might be taking small steps, we are going in the right direction. I hope we will be able to increase it this time next year as well. For a second year running, the budget is increasing the weekly rates of payments for all working age schemes. We have raised the income disregard for one-parent families and jobseeker's transitional payments. The Department will spend in excess of €3 billion in 2017 providing income supports for families through child benefit, qualified child increases and welfare payments. The working family payment and the back to school clothing allowance will all go towards trying to alleviate an unacceptable level of persistent child poverty. Social transfers play a huge part in alleviating this. They are quick and genuinely effective. Deputy Curran raised the issue of families who are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement in view of the fact that the scheme will be closed at the end this year. The scheme was closed to new entrants from 1 January 2014. Over the following years, the number of people relying on this payment has reduced greatly. The 1,200 or so families that are still receiving it need the payment. They are still in exceptional circumstances as a result of the difficulties of the past ten years. It would not be right to take that payment from them so we will continue to look after those people. Hopefully as the numbers reduce the scheme will unwind itself. I confirm the payment of income supplement will continue to be made to those customers after the closing date of the scheme. I expect its value will arrive at about €2.4 million this year. Provision has been made in the Department's Vote, but not under the existing heading. Over the next couple of days we propose to write to all of the people who are currently on the scheme to reassure them it will be there for as long as they need it. As employment improves and the economy recovers, we expect a reduction in those numbers. A number of Deputies have commented that the increase in the weekly rate of social welfare payment will not commence until the end of March. I would love, as most other people in the House would, if it was on 1 January. The aim will be for us to try to move it to as close to 1 January as we can. We had other items we wanted to introduce this year, which we would have not have been able to, and some directly relate to children's poverty. Examples are fuel allowance and telephone allowance for old age pensions who are living in isolation. If we had increased the payment on 1 January for all working age and pension payments, we would not have been able to make very valuable contributions in that area. I thank people for allowing us to do that.  There were a number of references made by Deputies to the living alone allowance, the bereavement grants, the potential for jobseeker's allowance to be extended to people who are self-employed and the invalidity payment. I will not go into all of them but perhaps we can talk further about them on Committee Stage. I thank everybody for their contributions and commend the Bill to the House.

The Bill seeks to implement the provisions agreed in the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA, 2018-2020 of earlier this year. It does so in the context of our country’s continuing economic growth and within the Government’s policy of carefully looking after our economy. Last month I had the honour of presenting my first budget to the House as Minister for Finance. That balanced budget provided the funding for the 2018 provisions of the Bill. It did so against the background of an economic recovery that few foresaw at the time the financial emergency measures passed through the House. Economic growth is predicted to be approximately 3.5% next year. We hope and expect to see employment levels continue to improve. Nobody should underestimate the extent to which the emergency measures have contributed to the great improvement in our public finances.The five FEMPI Acts between 2009 and 2013 made a vital contribution to the savings we needed in order to balance our books and restore our international credibility. The savings also allowed us to begin in reinvest in our public services, our infrastructure and in communities throughout the country. The Acts entailed considerable sacrifices from workers across all levels in the public service, which needs to be recognised and commended. That sacrifice was crucial to the transformation in our public finances in recent years. The FEMPI legislation also imposed reductions on contractor fees and on public service pensions, which I also acknowledge. Two years ago, this House enacted the 2015 Act which began the phased unwinding of FEMPI. This Bill completes that not inconsiderable task. However, it does so in the same spirit of minimising risk and ensuring that we do not lose sight of the broader economic context of Brexit and other external risks. The Bill proposes a way of repealing FEMPI that ensures, as far as is possible, that we will not need to return to such extraordinary measures. This is about future-proofing public service pay and pensions in the context of the recent and difficult history of reductions to them. This final FEMPI Bill also follows the progressive nature of its predecessors. The FEMPI reductions applied to all pay levels, but they impacted to a much greater extent those on higher salaries. Similarly, in the unwinding the Government is protecting the lower paid, who will see restoration much more quickly than senior public servants. Furthermore, the pay increases in this Bill are broadly in line with those taking place across the wider economy. I will outline the exact nature of the pay measures shortly when I come to the main provisions of the Bill. Our teachers, nurses, gardaí and other public servants and their retired counterparts are deserving of the pay and pension restoration set out in this Bill, particularly after such a long period of wage restraint and reductions. There is also a legal entitlement to that restoration, since the FEMPI Acts, which significantly reduced their pay and pension entitlements, were predicated on a financial emergency from which we have now, thankfully, emerged. The phased, measured and sustainable path ahead that this Bill provides is the best way to meet our legal obligation to repeal, but without returning us to pay rates that were unaffordable in the past and will be unaffordable again in the future. I will deal with this point further later in my comments. This summer, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and from Government employers across the State entered into negotiations with unions and associations representing more than 300,000 public servants. Their aim was to conclude a satisfactory successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement. Those negotiations were very difficult, but they led to the new Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. The agreement has been accepted by my colleagues in Cabinet and ratified by the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other staff associations. It builds on the foundations of not only the Lansdowne Road agreement, but also of the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements. In that sense, it offers the prospect of stability, which is welcome. In other ways, however, the new agreement represents change. Perhaps most significantly, it provides that from 2019 onwards, the vast majority of public servants will pay an additional superannuation contribution towards their pension. This will place their pension entitlement on a more sustainable footing. It is, therefore, a necessary and important step in terms of the future-proofing I mentioned earlier. As in previous agreements, this agreement also provides for a large number of specific reforms to help support our ongoing efforts to improve the services the State delivers. Reform should not be reserved for times of emergency; it has to be continuous and evolving, reflecting the ever-changing and dynamic world in which we live, and this agreement provides for that. Of course, the cost-cutting measures FEMPI introduced would not by themselves have been enough to get the country back on the right track. Without the collective agreements that underpinned the legislation, we could not have enjoyed industrial relations stability and all of the benefits associated with it at what was a very delicate juncture for our country. This is why I am convinced, as I have said on many occasions at other moments of difficulty, that the collective approach is the only viable option to the management of pay within our public services. That is why this Bill seeks to incentivise adherence to the agreement. It is therefore vital that we ensure that those who have made a commitment to work with us are rewarded for that. The Government believes in the collective approach as encapsulated in the public service stability agreement and that is why we are now seeking to reflect that agreement in the provisions of this Bill. At this juncture, I am required by the Standing Orders of this House to state that this is a money Bill containing measures which have already been provided for in the budget and it provides for the repeal of emergency legislation. As such, the Bill has, with the full agreement of the House’s Business Committee, not been the subject of the usual pre-legislative scrutiny. I also ask the House to note that both the Central Bank and the European Central Bank have been formally consulted and the latter has published its opinion on its website. I will deal with the sections relating to the Central Bank in detail on Committee Stage. This is a substantial and complex piece of legislation, the majority of whose measures are of a financial nature. It is divided into seven parts. For the benefit of Members I will now outline its main provisions. Part 1 is a general, introductory section setting out the basic terms that will be used throughout, including "covered" and "non-covered" public servants. It also provides for the repeal of the 2009 Act, so that the pension-related deduction will cease to apply to public servants as of 1 January 2019; as from that date the additional superannuation contribution shall apply. Part 2 is the most substantive part of the Bill. It provides for pay restoration for all public servants, supplementing the increases under the FEMPI Act 2015. By the end of the process outlined in this part, all of the FEMPI pay cuts will be undone. Chapter 2 provides for pay increases for all public servants covered by the PSSA as set out in that agreement as follows. They will receive 1% on 1 January 2018 and a further 1% on 1 October 2018. In 2019 those whose salaries do not exceed €30,000 will receive 1% on 1 January 2019 and all public servants under the PSSA will receive 1.75% on 1 September 2019. Finally, in 2020 those whose salaries do not exceed €32,000 will receive 0.5% on 1 January 2020 and all public servants under the PSSA will receive 2% on 1 October 2020. Chapter 3 provides for the same pay increases for those not covered by the PSSA but at a slower rate. Specifically, they will receive every pay increase I have just outlined exactly nine months after their "covered" counterparts. In addition, as section 21 sets out, they will not receive any incremental increases for the duration of the agreement. It is the Government’s ambition that every public servant will be covered by the PSSA. The vast majority of public servants have subscribed to the collective approach agreed with their representatives and must be prioritised when it comes to further pay restoration. Chapter 4 outlines how the measures I have just outlined will interact with the pre-existing commitments under the 2015 Act. Chapter 5 deals with those public servants for whom the pay measures in the PSSA will not have fully restored pay to pre-FEMPI levels.The vast majority - everyone earning up to €70,000, who make up about 90% of the total public service - will have had their pay fully restored by October 2020. However, for the minority I am speaking about here, this chapter will complete that process over a further time period. There are two different cohorts covered by this chapter: those earning between €70,000 and €150,000; and those earning over €150,000. In both cases, the Bill provides that an order must be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform specifying a date after 1 October 2020 - the date of the last pay increase - by which full restoration is to have taken place. For those earning under €150,000, this date must be no later than 1 July 2021. For those earning over that amount, it must be no later than 1 July 2022. I would remind Members of three factors in regard to these measures. First, the legal entitlement of these individuals to this restoration. Second, the fact that these individuals were proportionally much more severely affected by the pay reductions and are having their salaries restored at a much slower pace than those at lower salary levels. Third, that while their gross pay will be restored, the additional superannuation contribution, which I will shortly outline, will act to reduce take home pay on a permanent basis. Finally in relation to this Part, section 20 specifies that all members of the Government will be altogether excluded from this further restoration. Moreover, the Government has decided to waive all of the restoration due under the public service stability agreement. The next Part, Part 3, is shorter and concerns pensions. As well as those currently working, the FEMPI Acts affected many public service pensioners. Just as there was pay restoration, and a legal imperative to complete it, there must be further amelioration of the public service pension reduction, PSPR, for those still liable for it. This is done through the phased raising of thresholds, continuing the process begun under the 2015 Act. By the end of 2020 the vast majority of public service pensioners will no longer have any reduction to their payments. For those still liable for the PSPR, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must make an order by the end of December 2020 specifying when it will cease to apply. Part 4 is also about pensions, but in this case it is about how public servants contribute towards their pensions. Since the very first FEMPI Act eight years ago, public servants have paid a pension related deduction, PRD, on all of their earnings. This will continue until the end of next year, as set out in the FEMPI Act 2015. However, this Bill repeals the original FEMPI Act 2009, so that no PRD will be charged after that date. Instead, as provided for under the PSSA, the majority of public servants will pay an additional superannuation contribution, or ASC, from the 1 January 2019 onwards. This secures substantial funding towards the cost of public service pensions, amounting to approximately €546 million per annum from 2020 onwards. This will be an addition to some €700 million already contributed on an annual basis. This permanent source of revenue will help to defray the cost of providing pensions to public servants into the future and is necessary to place public service pensions on a more sustainable footing in light of the significant accrued liabilities that exist. The ASC is only chargeable on pensionable pay. The ASC will apply differently depending on whether a public servant is a member of a standard accrual scheme, a fast accrual scheme or the single public service pension scheme. For those who joined fast accrual schemes before 2013, the ASC rates that will apply will be the same as the PRD rates. For those in standard accrual schemes, the ASC rates will be more favourable than the PRD rates, as the threshold will be raised in 2019 and again in 2020. For those who are members of the single scheme, that is, all new entrants to any part of the public service after 2012, the ASC rates will be more favourable again, reflecting the fact that, as the report of the Public Service Pay Commission found, this scheme is already on a more sustainable basis than those that preceded it. For those not covered by the agreement, a larger proportion of their salaries will be subject to ASC compared to covered workers until 2021, but from 2021 onwards the same ASC rates will apply to both covered and non-covered public servants. I am sure Members will appreciate the complexity of this. It is difficult to present, in the time available here, all of the information regarding percentages and thresholds, which is far better conveyed and understood in tabular form. It is enough to say at this juncture that the effect of the ASC becoming a permanent feature of the pay and pensions landscape is that public servants will henceforth pay a fairer contribution for the pension they will eventually enjoy upon retirement. That is what this Part of the Bill achieves. Part 5 places certain provisions of the FEMPI legislation on a permanent, non-emergency footing. These provisions relate to the power to vary the fees paid to contractors, mainly health professionals, for services and goods rendered. The exercise of such a power would of course only be possible where a contractual right to vary exists. Parts 6 and 7 deal with transitional arrangements and miscellaneous provisions, including transitional arrangements for the payment of professional fees. As part of these transitional arrangements and in the context of exiting the FEMPI legislative framework, the Minister for Health has announced that he intends to initiate a process of engagement in 2018, in consultation with my Department, with relevant representative bodies on service delivery, contractual reform and associated fees. This process will aim to conclude a multi-annual approach to fees, commencing in 2019, in return for service improvement and contractual reform and in line with Government priorities for the health service. The repeal of the financial emergency legislation is an important milestone in the history of our State, as was the achievement of broadly balancing our books in the recent budget. While our economy may be recovering, our society is not yet healed. Future historians or economists might see this recovery, from their detached perspective, as in many ways a rapid turnaround, relatively speaking. However, I know that those who have lived through it will not and do not feel the same. After all, by the end of this agreement, it will have been over ten years since the first FEMPI measures were introduced. Notwithstanding that fact, a careful and gradual unwinding of these reductions is the only sensible way to proceed, given the constraints we face and the overriding priority for stability and sustainability in our public finances. It is about balancing these requirements with our responsibilities to restore pay for the public servants who contributed so much to the economic recovery from which we are currently benefitting. This Bill, in so far as it can be achieved in today’s uncertain economic climate, provides certainty and a degree of closure for contractors, for pensioners and for public servants. It also allows a level of future planning through the introduction of the ASC to improve the long-term sustainability of public service pensions. Lastly, it provides a phased series of modest and affordable pay increases over three years in a way that is fair to public servants and the people of this country. I look forward to hearing the views of the House. I commend this Bill to the House.

Having sat on the other side of the House for the introduction of much of the FEMPI legislation, it is one of those Bills one tends to remember where one was sitting when we introduced it because it brought huge pain to many families which, obviously, we did not want to do but we were left in no position other than to do it. It is worth recalling some of the key elements of it. In 2009, the pension related deduction was introduced, which brought in, effectively overnight, a further 7% reduction in salaries. The PRD was contributing about €900 million a year to the Exchequer. In September 2009 we introduced an 11-month pay freeze. An issue that is often forgotten is that pay rises that had been committed to under previous agreements of 3.5% in September 2009 and 2.5% in June 2010 did not happen.Instead, substantial pay cuts were provided for in December 2009. The €1.1 billion that is needed to fund this legislation is just a portion of the contribution made by our public and civil servants to this country's economic recovery. We should also take into account the extra unpaid hours that were introduced and the extra burden taken on by many people in standing up for services in many areas that had been savaged. It is important this evening to remember the very real cost of FEMPI to families. In that context, I welcome the introduction of legislation to signal the end of FEMPI. I acknowledge that the Minister and the trade union movement have done a great deal of work. The Bill is not perfect. We want to engage with the Minister on Committee and Report Stages to try to improve it. We will signal a number of areas that need urgent attention. As my time is limited, I will focus on a few of them. The flexibility of our public service was most evident in Mountmellick last week, when members of the Civil Defence, local authority staff, Army personnel, gardaí and welfare staff mobilised overnight to provide an effective on-site response to a serious situation that was developing. I could mention some other initiatives, such as the introduction of online passport applications and the various changes in welfare and community welfare services. I know the Minister presented awards to civil servants on Monday evening. All of these changes were introduced during the FEMPI era with a view to improving people's experiences. Despite the cuts I have mentioned, the civil servants who introduced these changes did so with a willingness to make people's experiences of the Civil Service better. We want to signal our concerns in a number of areas. The new contracts that were introduced during 2012 have added a new layer of pay in many areas, the most high-profile of which is teaching. These changes have also been applied in the medical sector and in the Garda. Many staff in the Oireachtas who are doing the same job are being paid at different rates. The Public Service Pay Commission is commissioning a report on this issue as part of an examination of how we should address it. We need to acknowledge that pay inequality is causing dissent in the public sector and is putting pressure on people. When we ask two teachers to teach classes, we pay them differently. When we ask two gardaí to walk the streets at night to protect us, we pay them differently even though they face the same level of danger. I acknowledge that a report has been commissioned. We must see it as soon as possible. The three teaching unions, particularly the INTO and the TUI, have concerns about this Bill that are based completely on pay inequality. We need to move to address that. We will also be looking for clarity with regard to the future of allowances that were withdrawn during the period of FEMPI cuts, particularly in nursing and teaching, having originally been introduced by the Labour Court. The allowances available to teaching principals in primary schools in recognition of the extra burden they carry were reduced. This should be reconsidered, as should the allowances that were paid to teachers in Gaeltacht areas in respect of teaching through Irish and having to access teaching materials through Irish. In addition to pay reduction, there has been a significant change in human resources policies in the public sector. The public and Civil Service now faces a substantial human resources challenge. While pay is an issue, old and inflexible human resources practices are discouraging our nurses and teachers from coming back and taking up positions. We need the best staff possible to fill shortages in areas like medicine and teaching. We have a shortage of pilots in the Air Corps. According to yesterday's newspapers, which covered news other than the obvious, just seven physics graduates are currently training to go into secondary teaching. That is an extraordinary failure for a country that prides itself on its efforts in the area of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We are not encouraging the best graduates to go into teaching to ensure we have a throughput of science, technology, engineering and mathematics teachers. We need to look at human resources practices and make them relevant to the workforce of today. There is a need for flexibility with regard to matters like career breaks. The rigid approach of the past must go if we want to encourage people back into the public service. Pay is an issue, but we need to be much more flexible regarding human resources. As part of that flexibility, we need to come back to the question of pay equalisation. We like to have gardaí, nurses and teachers living in our communities, but if they are on the new levels of pay they cannot afford to live in Dublin because of rental costs. Public service employers must look for imaginative solutions, perhaps involving housing co-operatives for teachers and gardaí. This is not solely a wage issue. We need to make it more attractive for our public servants to come to work in Dublin. If we want to them to give their time and dedication to the public service in Dublin, surely it is not beyond our ingenuity as Members of this House to help employers and senior managers in the public service to find ways to facilitate this. FEMPI also put huge pressure on many contractors to the State, including pharmacists and GPs. There are pressures in such areas because of the decreased availability of professionals to supply services. GPs and pharmacists took a particularly big hit under FEMPI. If we are to move to Sláintecare, which places a massive emphasis on primary care, we have to reinvest in our GPs and pharmacists and give them an incentive to build the kind of primary care structure we want and consider necessary in order to reduce the pressure on our health service. The reimagining of their role that will be required in the context of the reversal of this legislation should be linked with our ambition to create a proper primary health care service, as set out in Sláintecare. The reversal of certain reductions that is provided for in this Bill constitutes a nod in the direction of retired public servants. Although the cohort of retired civil servants comes under the broader church of ICTU, it is not formally represented. I have raised this issue with the Minister on many occasions. This was the first time we cut their salaries. Many of them do not have the possibility of getting this money back over time. For many of them, time is not on their side in terms of making another income. We must find a more formal way ensuring retired public servants, who have much to give, are properly involved. I acknowledge that the Minister has met representatives of the alliance on many occasions. There needs to be formal recognition of their role in talks which affect their income and conditions. I am nervous about the inclusion in this Bill of an aspect of industrial relations strategy. I will expect to hear more on this issue from the Minister on Committee and Report Stages. Sections 11 to 14, inclusive, differentiate between public servants who approve the deal and those who do not. This strategy has been agreed by the employer, but I remain to be convinced that it belongs in primary legislation. We need to work to consider that in much more detail. This legislation represents an improvement on where we have come from. It is a step in the right direction. While we need to look at pay and conditions, as I have said, we also need to reimagine the role of our public service. We need to make the public service a place in which people are happy and proud to work. We owe a huge debt to our public service. As we come to the end of this year, I think of events during the year like the loss of Rescue 116, to which the public service responded by mobilising in defence of their colleagues to try to find those who had been on board. Public servants are able to mobilise quickly in response to major events around the country. I have already mentioned what happened in Mountmellick last week. We cannot continue to depend on their generosity of spirit. We have to reward them financially while respecting their ambition to have career pathways in the public service. They need to be assured that a career in the service of the State can be as rewarding as a career in the private sector. The public service should have all the advantages of the private sector. It has many of them, but there are many areas in which public servants do not have sufficient control. As public representatives, we need to show ambition by giving them that control.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	The Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017 will enact the public service stability agreement that has been reached between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The question of how the Government will deal with the fact that three teaching unions - the ASTI, the TUI and the INTO - have yet to ratify the agreement is a serious one. This outstanding issue is a cause for great concern. Under this agreement, teachers who joined the profession after 2011 will continue to be paid less than colleagues who took up their positions before then, even though they are doing exactly the same job. This issue of pay parity is the main reason the stability agreement has not been ratified by the teacher unions. It is of the utmost importance that this issue is not allowed to escalate further. While industrial action must be avoided, we cannot expect young teachers to accept this inequality indefinitely. The vital work of teachers in our communities underpins the quality of our education standards, of which we have rightly been proud over the generations.We must endeavour to attract the very best young people into the teaching profession. One of the key elements of attracting them is offering a fair and appropriate financial package which offers them a clear path for their career. By continuing with the current regime we demotivate the teachers who have joined since 2011 and we stand the risk of making teaching a second rate profession, which will do untold damage to the education system and have far-reaching consequences for our economy in the years ahead. I urge the Minister to take this particular aspect of the Bill seriously and to find a solution that will honour the commitment of our hard-working teachers. Our young gardaí and members of the Defence Forces find themselves in a similar position. We expect these men and women, who put themselves in harm's way, to uphold the rule of law and to keep our society safe. We expect these young men and women to maintain the security of our State. We expect them to do so and then they are paid less than their colleagues who joined before 2011. This cannot continue. Staff retention and recruitment is another key issue affecting the public sector. This agreement fails to deal fully with it. In areas such as nursing and the Defence Forces numbers have fallen to critical levels. GPs, particularly in rural areas, are failing to take up positions. This has a huge impact on rural communities. This not only affects the services themselves, but also the conditions under which existing employees are working. While this Bill addresses some of the grievances for public sector pensioners, the speed of restoration is not what they would be happy with. This agreement will cost €880 million over the next three years or €1.1 billion over four years. The bulk of the cost will be loaded to 2019 and beyond. The cost in 2018 will be €180 million. Unwinding FEMPI on a fiscally sustainable basis has always been a core policy objective for Fianna Fáil. During the financial crisis which began in 2008, FEMPI legislation was enacted in 2009 and again in 2010, 2011 and 2013. As part of the gradual unwinding of FEMPI legislation, the Haddington Road agreement and then the Lansdowne Road agreement were negotiated. Fianna Fáil was not part of the negotiations. However, we believe it is in the interest of the country that the agreement reached will be sustainable and fair, particularly for lower and medium-paid workers. It must also allow for more public services to be provided, particularly in health and education. It is imperative that we make these professions attractive for young people in order to ensure that we can provide the workforce needed for our growing population. Our public servants are key to providing the services which our population needs and demands. We look forward to progressing these issues.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	At the outset, to begin on a positive note, I welcome the beginning of the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation. My party has always had this as a goal, as has been outlined by Deputies Calleary and Cahill. That aspect, at least, is to be welcomed. It is a long time coming and, as Deputy Cahill mentioned, our gardaí, teachers, nurses and other public servants are extremely well-deserving of these measures. However, it is a bit like the curate's egg. It is spoiled in parts, which may spoil it for everybody. We hope not. As Deputy Calleary said, we will see on Committee Stage. There are many sections to the Bill. It is a complex Bill, as the Minister suggested. There is one section with which I have difficulty and with which the teaching unions have difficulty as has been mentioned already. We know how difficult it has been for the unions and public servants affected to carry this cross for the last several years. It is welcome that we are beginning to progress the unwinding of the legislation. I wish to signal a series of concerns, particularly on the dichotomy created within the Bill between the covered public servants and those not covered. The introduction of that definition at all, but particularly into primary legislation, does not sit well with me and does not sit well with industrial relations custom and practice. We are well aware of the difficulties which have been experienced as a result of the lack of pay equality in the teaching unions in particular. There are newly qualified teachers who entered the profession months after colleagues who graduated the year before. In some cases there is a gap of €26,000 in terms of pay and benefits arising from the mere fact of some having a graduation date a few months later than those of their colleagues. Teachers are doing the same work in the schools and the staff room, in many cases they are teaching in the same classrooms, they are walking up and down the same corridors and they are sitting at lunch together and have to look one another in the eye. I know that senior colleagues and those who qualified before the change feel just as awful at the gap of up to €26,000 between them and their colleagues, despite doing the same work. It is a very uncomfortable situation and it is very unfair. It must be to the credit of the teaching profession that it has hung its hat on the issue of seeking pay equality and trying to work towards it. That is the principal reason the teaching unions have not been comfortable with the previous agreements and why they did not enter into them. The principal difficulty with this legislation as I see it is that it does not appear even to create a pathway to pay equality. I welcome the Minister's comments on what path forward can be found. I hope one can be found. That aspiration does not even appear to be contained in the legislation. If there is a way to sew such a pathway into it, perhaps through amendments on Committee Stage, it may be a way to proceed. At face value, however, I do not see that in the legislation. There are again difficulties in respect of traditional custom and practice, trade union rights and industrial relations machinery. If one looks at section 21, there is what appears to be a very draconian measure. Not only does it prohibit, or appear to prohibit, members of those unions who will not enter an agreement from receiving the benefits of the measures in this legislation, but if I interpret it correctly, and this is the key point, it appears to affect even those unions which have not assented to agreement even if they have not engaged in industrial action. If they were to vocalise their dissent or express their unhappiness with the agreement, even if they were to take no industrial action or steps along those lines, their members will be excluded from the benefits because, if I am reading it correctly, they will be non-covered public servants. The union they belong to will be in that category. It is a step too far to disbar a member of a union from benefitting. It appears that many issues such as the right to collective action, the right to take collective bargaining and freedom of association arise. I would welcome any clarification if I and the teaching unions are wrong in that interpretation. Certainly as it stands, section 21 appears to have that interpretation. Even were there an argument for such a measure, as Deputy Calleary has already said, primary legislation is not the place for it. The measures appear to be too draconian for a simple lack of assent, especially when it is not followed by industrial action. Those are my concerns on the Bill. There is much to be welcomed, primarily the unpicking of the FEMPI legislation and the progress for many public servants, which is long-deserved and long-awaited. There are other concerns which centre on section 21 and on the definition of non-covered public servants. I await clarification on whether those concerns can be addressed and overcome. Perhaps there is an issue of interpretation. If that can be clarified in the House it would be very welcome. As it stands, they are concerns.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. It is an issue which has been prolonged to the frustration of many public workers. As we know, public sector workers have suffered an average of a 15% cut in pay. On top of this, new entrants from 1 January 2011 start on a payscale that is on average 10% lower than the rest of the workforce. We welcome some of the measures in this Bill which provide for the restoration of the basic salary of public servants reduced under FEMPI legislation. We also welcome the measures that provide for the restoration of pensions payable to public servants through the elimination or reduction of the pension-related deduction. Last year Sinn Féin launched a framework document on the extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement and the fair and orderly unwinding of FEMPI. We are in favour of the orderly unwinding of FEMPl. We appreciate that if this legislation was scrapped, those on higher incomes would benefit disproportionately. We want to see reform so that those on low or middle pay in the public sector can be prioritised in pay agreements.We recognise that the pay and conditions of public sector workers are primarily a matter for trade unions and their memberships. On the basis of the broad support among union membership for the new pay agreement, Sinn Féin will support this legislation. However, we have a number of concerns and will be seeking to amend the Bill on Committee Stage. One of the most fundamental issues for post-2011 recruits in the public sector is the issue of pay equality. The teachers' unions have rejected the new pay agreement mainly on that basis. Increases in the cost of living and the legitimate concerns of front-line public sector staff doing the same work for less money mean it is not feasible for the issue to be left until after 2020. Teachers, gardaí and nurses have all taken industrial action on the issue and it must be resolved. Sinn Féin is committed to equal pay for equal work and believes the Government must commit to addressing the issue to avoid further unrest in the public sector. We also share some concerns highlighted by trade unions relating to the punishment clause in sections 21 and 33 and will work to have those addressed. It beggars belief that the Government intends to impose sanctions on public sector workers who have not signed up to the new pay agreement. It shows the arrogance at the heart of this Government, an arrogance that all Members have witnessed in recent days in particular. It also shows that the Minister has learned nothing from the industrial unrest last year. As a strategy, it has failed. Instead of one teaching union being outside the pay agreement structure, there are now three, which sends a message that the issue needs to be resolved. The Government needs to learn that it cannot bully public sector workers into submission and that all workers, not only those in the public sector, have legitimate rights, including the right to engage in industrial action. Sinn Féin will fight hard to remove those clauses on Committee Stage and stand up for the thousands of public sector workers across the State who have not received fair play under this Government. We will not support any legislation that allows workers to be sanctioned through increment freezes simply for standing up for their basic rights. I call on the Government and Fianna Fáil to make a clear commitment that those who have not signed up to the new pay agreement will not be punished in that manner and that the clause will be removed from the legislation on Committee Stage.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	I might be alone among the Members currently in the Chamber as having been in Government Buildings on the night the pension levy was introduced in 2009. There are many, including all the civil and public servants working tonight, who will remember that. Should they ever forget, there is a handy reminder in every pay packet they receive. At the time, we did not know what FEMPI was and continued to call it the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts. Some in the public service could not believe it would happen. People did not believe the Fianna Fáil-led Government of the time would go to war with civil and public servants or attack them. Little did we know in 2009 that it was to be the first of many attacks on civil and public servants. As a trade union organiser, I joined other representative organisations to form the 24/7 alliance. It was specifically formed because the belief among shift workers and those with unsocial hours such as firefighters, gardaí, prison officers, nurses and so on was that once the Government had started with that measure, it would then go after those receiving premium pay packets. We were right to come together to fight that measure at the time and the 24/7 alliance had a huge impact because it was trade unionism and collective activism at its most core and basic level. In his contribution, the Minister advised Members that nobody should underestimate the extent to which those emergency measures have contributed to the great improvement in our public finances. Equally, nobody should underestimate the extent to which those measures begun by Fianna Fáil and taken up with a degree of enthusiasm by Fine Gael are currently causing huge problems in the public service, in particular in regard to recruitment. I refer to the pay inequality caused by the two-tier pay system. Sinn Féin has for some time been calling for a fair and timely unwinding of FEMPI from the bottom up in order that those on the lowest incomes will be first to benefit, ahead of those on high incomes. Any Deputy who has been visited by representatives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, or the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, as most Deputies probably have, will tell the Minister that the two-tier pay structure is contributing to emigration. However, it is doing more than that. I represented nurses for a long time. Many people correctly say that nurses often emigrate for a year after they graduate. However, such nurses are now not coming back to Ireland, which is causing a recruitment crisis in the health service. A similar recruitment crisis has been caused in the education sector. My sister is deputy principal of a primary school and dreads any teacher going on sick leave. I have spoken at length to delegations from the INTO in my office. They most fear having to find a substitute teacher because none is available. When I asked where all the teachers have gone, I was told they have gone to Dubai, England, the United States and so on and they are not coming back. The unequal pay structure plays a huge part in that. The failure to address that issue will cost the Exchequer in the long run in terms of services not being delivered, expensive overtime and, ultimately, the loss of the brightest and best graduates who are leaving and not coming back. That should give the Government cause for great concern. Unfortunately, the Bill will compound and continue the pay inequality for civil and public servants recruited since 2011, which is wrong. That UNITE and the three teachers' unions have voted against the deal should make the Government sit up, take a bit of notice and acknowledge this is a very serious and real concern. Working and doing the exact same job for 15% less than the person one works alongside is not only demoralising but fundamentally wrong. As I said, I am a trade unionist and have fought and campaigned for the right to equal pay for work of equal value. The two-tier pay structure is being continued while we are told the economy has picked up and we are all doing better, but that is not being felt by newly qualified teachers, NQTs, or recent graduates in the nursing profession. Industrial action, in particular by the teaching profession, is a very real possibility. Putting into legislation matters that should be the subject of normal industrial relations procedures is quite an aggressive act and will have the desired effect. It will anger civil and public servants. It will send exactly the message the Taoiseach sought to send to such workers when he spoke of the possibility of strikes being outlawed. That is the type of message those workers are receiving. It is about a heavy hand all of the time rather than talking about issues and stamping down on concerns rather than recognising they need to be dealt with. That is not the right way to go. I share the concerns expressed by the teachers' unions in this regard, and the failure to acknowledge such concerns will lead us into further problems and further recruitment and retention crises.That said, we acknowledge that the public service stability agreement, PSSA, has been accepted by the majority of trade unions, and that is important. We will, at an appropriate time, propose amendments to this legislation. As my colleague, Deputy Nolan, has outlined, we do not object to the Bill, but that is not to say we are happy about it; rather, we are committed to working with the teachers and nurses and those other workers in the civil and public service who are committed and working hard to reverse pay inequality. We will do all we can from these benches to assist them in that regard.

The Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill is obviously an implementation of the public service stability agreement. As such, some public sector workers who voted to accept the deal will get some pay restoration, which they very badly need and obviously deserve. However, there is something rotten in the Bill in that it represents a very Thatcherite tactic of divide and conquer. Other workers will suffer from the Bill, namely those who rejected the PSSA because of the real and specific impact it would have on their lives. All three teachers' unions have voted no, and the first thing this brings up is that no one should have the right to vote on other people's work conditions. It should be a democratic right that if one is not impacted in the same way by something, one should not have the right to force other people to accept it. The Bill is negative overall. It compounds and continues the two-tier pay inequality for all young public servants - again, some more than others, but all. How disgraceful it is that this is being maintained. The Minister's speaking note reads, "There is also a legal entitlement to that restoration, since the FEMPI Acts which significantly reduced ... pay and pension entitlements were predicated on a financial emergency of unprecedented severity from which we have now, thankfully, emerged". How, then, is there any justification for maintaining those austerity measures that were placed on public sector workers? There is none whatsoever. No change can occur to heal the real wound that has been inflicted on young workers on unequal pay for the whole three years of this agreement, and the Minister's words are no justification for maintaining that. The saying, "Never waste a good crisis" is being implemented. The so-called pension levy, which was meant to be a temporary measure for the bailout, is not removed; it remains, and there is no prospect it will ever go. It will therefore continue to reduce the pay of most public servants. What is particularly nefarious about the Bill is that punishment is being meted out to all those who did not accept the deal, the three teachers' unions in particular. I love the language in the briefing document. This is classic "Yes Minister" stuff where it reads:Q.2 How are public servants who do not sign up [to be] treated?To incentivise adherence to the collective approach, the Bill provides for less favourable terms for public servants who are not covered.Did anyone ever hear of such a formulation? An incentive is meant to be attractive. The briefing document further outlines what will happen to those who do not agree to the deal when it states:(a) Slower pay restoration ...(b) The suspension of [increments] (up to [2021]);(c) A lower entry threshold for ASC.In other words, they will pay more of this so-called pension levy that was introduced as a temporary measure. I remember it because I was teaching at the time it was introduced. This is outrageous. Teachers will now be punished, have their increments frozen and continue at a higher pension levy. This is an absolute attack on the right to be in a union, on democratic rights and on the right of people to decide their own fate. People in other unions should therefore take note of this. The whole common basic scale has been completely upended, and this division will now be maintained. People will be on different rates and will have different punishments meted out to them. Did the Minister of State ever wonder why it is teachers who seem continually to vote against these measures? Perhaps the wider public does not understand. In this instance all three teacher unions voted against. Does the Minister of State remember? The Government was happy to try to isolate the ASTI in the previous agreement, but now all three teacher unions are at one on this, and the reason is that teachers have been more impacted by pay inequity. Young teachers appointed after 2011 have already lost over €26,000 in earnings that they would have had if they were on the same scale as their pre-2011 counterparts, but they have also lost earnings due to the other pay cuts that their senior colleagues faced as well. This is the so-called locked-out generation, young so-called professionals - young workers - who cannot afford to pay rent, buy a house, get a mortgage or do many other things previous generations were able to do. It is an infliction of worse conditions on young people and the kind of policy that resulted in the revolt that led to Jeremy Corbyn's massive increase in the vote share for the Labour Party in Britain. The Government should take note of this. I was talking to a young teacher on the protest outside before this debate. He made the point that teachers are always concerned if they take any industrial action about what will happen to the children. We asked him about children that he might like to have at some stage in the future. Did they not count as well? I believe that parents and the public in general understand this. They understand why teachers and others are not willing to accept unequal pay. To teachers I say stick to your guns, organise and put on massive pressure. This Government is hanging on by a thread, as we saw over the weekend. It is on its last legs. The arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is mortally wounded. They are both at one on this issue, of no recovery for workers. They are unanimous about that. Massive pressure can be put on Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, members of which are not even here tonight, to reverse this. The Government wonders why there is a huge shortage of teachers. It is because their choice is to fight or to emigrate. Why would any young person who went to huge trouble to get qualifications, not just primary degrees and HDips but also masters and all kinds of other qualifications that teachers now routinely acquire, stay and put up with this when they could be amply well paid in other countries? What will we do about the brain drain? We have already heard reports about unqualified teachers teaching in schools while qualified teachers have had to emigrate because they cannot live in this country. Rents in my constituency are now routinely €1,600 to €2,000 per month. How could any young teacher afford to pay that, or any other young worker for that matter? In his opening remarks the Minister said there had been considerable sacrifices for a decade of austerity, a lost decade for many people, that had reaped benefits for the economy. Yet, this is the reward that workers get. He also said that our teachers, nurses, gardaí and other public servants and their retired counterparts are deserving of the pay and pension restoration set out in the Bill. However, teachers will not get any restoration from the Bill, so that was a little disingenuous of the Minister. He did not even make reference to the fact that people who do not accept the tyranny, the diktat, that is handed down will not get anything and will be punished. People should take a lesson from this. In the past, if workers did not agree with a pay deal, they simply did not get the pay deal. Now not only do they not get the pay deal, but they also get other things taken from them for daring not to agree to the pay deal. This is the new neo-liberal normal in this country. We need to build a political alternative and a trade union alternative. It is not a good reflection on the trade union leadership that it has accepted such an erosion of long-standing pay and conditions and inflicted that on a new generation.It has become clear that we are moving on from the previous easy target that was young workers. What is happening now is that the Government and the establishment have decided to target older workers by going after their pensions. This is a very sinister development that should give everybody cause for alarm. I hope the three teacher unions will come together to decide what united action they can take to address this. They have every reason to hold their nerve. As I said, a general election is unquestionably on the cards soon. The unions should make political capital while they can.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	It is important to bear in mind the background to these proposals. In order to bail out banks and developers, the State initiated a wave of cuts to public services and waged an unremitting war on public sector workers. Overnight, following the bank bailout and the advent of the troika, the narrative became that the great public enemies were the teacher, the nurse, the firefighter and the workers in these Houses. Their wages and conditions and their pension entitlements became the obsession of economists and commentators. The causes of the crisis were apparently forgotten as the State focused its attention on reducing the wages and pensions of public servants. In fact, it savaged the earnings and pensions of workers and retired workers and slashed the pay and pension entitlements of new recruits. Several different figures have been offered, but one estimate is that the State took €1.4 billion from public servants every year since the crisis began. These savings were achieved through four waves of austerity measures. The first was the 11 month pay freeze introduced in September 2009 under financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. National agreement pay increases of 3.5% due in September 2009 and 2.5% due in June 2010 were abandoned under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement. The second austerity measure, introduced in March 2009, was the pension levy or pension related deduction, PRD. This levy is deducted at source and returned to the Exchequer, thereby constituting a reduction in gross pay. Higher rates were applied to the higher paid, but the average deduction was 7% of total salary. To give an idea of its scale, the PRD has yielded savings of more than €900 million, or almost €1 billion, for the Exchequer in each full year since it was introduced. The third austerity provision came in the form of a second FEMPI Act enacted in December 2009. This introduced a comprehensive pay cut from 1 January 2010 which meant a clerical officer on average pay lost €1,500 per annum. The fourth austerity measure was achieved by way of the Haddington Road agreement, which brought further cuts in public service pay and pensions and a raft of productivity measures, including additional hours valued at 6% in pay terms. This agreement introduced increment deferrals, overtime rate changes and changes in flexible work practices. As well as the four waves of cuts, the Government restructured two levies, the income levy and the health levy, into a new universal social charge, USC. A worker on €37,000 a year, which is the maximum rate of pay for a clerical officer in the Civil Service, now pays almost €1,400 a year in USC. The lower paid took a huge hit as a consequence of this charge. During the austerity years, successive Governments cut public service employment across the board, with numbers falling from a high of 320,000 to less than 290,000 in 2015. This reduction was achieved via the blunt instruments of a recruitment moratorium, incentivised retirement and voluntary departures. Overall, there was a 10% reduction in jobs across all the public sectors. These cuts have resulted in huge income losses for all public and civil servants, but particularly those on lower incomes of between €20,000 and €37,000. In addition, those still in work must do longer hours, have less flexibility, a larger workload and fewer supports. As a result of these measures, the public service pay bill has fallen dramatically, from more than €17 billion before the recession to €14 billion net in 2014. As well as the impact on workers, this has also impacted the economy by way of the loss of discretionary income and savings. Despite propaganda to the contrary, the remuneration levels of lower-paid public servants in this country are, according to statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, in line with or below the average pay of those elsewhere in Europe. Moreover, OECD statistics published in December 2014 show that the size of the Irish public sector, at 18.4% of total employment, is not far from the average level across all member countries. Official figures show that 45% of all public servants in Ireland earn less than €45,000 a year, while 68% earn less than €50,000. This is contrary to the impression given that the majority of public servants are slán abhaile and highly paid. Other emergency measures that are of continuing concern to public servants were implemented in the same austerity period. One of these relates to starting pay for new entrants in the public sector. In 2010, the then Minister for Finance determined, unilaterally and without the necessity of introducing legislation, to reduce pay scales for all new entrants by 10% on all points of the scale. This meant that from 2011 onwards, workers entered their pay scales at least two points below those applying to their pre-2011 colleagues. The workers concerned are, therefore, behind where they would otherwise have been on the scales while progressing through their increments. This effect was compounded in 2012 by the unilateral abolition of universal allowances for new entrants. Given that these allowances applied to all members of the relevant grade or category, they were, in effect, a part of basic pay. For example, prison officers or firefighters recruited from 2011 were not only placed on a scale that was longer than that applicable to colleagues recruited before them, they also had to go without a significant universal allowance which their colleagues retained. This issue has been largely resolved through negotiations under the auspices of the Lansdowne Road agreement. However, the post-2013 solution to the 2010 alteration of scales for new entrants to the public service means that such workers remain on scale points behind those that applied previously. In 2013, the Haddington Road agreement reduced the pay of public servants earning above €65,000 a year and imposed additional unremunerated working hours on employees. On average, an additional 2.5 working hours were added to the working week of all public sector workers. The issue of unremunerated working time remains unresolved. While the effect of the increase varies depending on pre-existing working hours, all public servants who worked fewer than 39 hours per week experienced an unpaid increase in their working time. There is an estimated further €430 million in savings from increases in productivity deriving from the almost 15 million additional working hours and a range of other reform measures. It is clear, bearing in mind all these cuts, that when the Minister and others tell us how much they are increasing the pay of public sector workers, it is akin to a burglar offering to return a portion of the stolen goods. Nobody in that situation would say thanks to the burglar for giving back what had been robbed. That is why I do not welcome this Bill in its totality. The theft of workers' pay and pensions was not negotiated but, rather, imposed by means of extraordinary legislative measures passed in this House. We cannot, apparently, pass emergency legislation to deal with the housing crisis, health crisis or climate chaos but, by God, we could do so when it came to cutting the pay and conditions of nurses, teachers, firefighters and clerical workers across the service. Years after this Government told us we are in recovery, the economy is booming and this is a great country in which to do business, we continue with the charade that there is, in fact, a financial emergency, but one which only requires the theft of pay and pensions from public sector workers to address it. The Government cannot legitimately claim that the recent pay and stability deal somehow offered workers restitution by way of a settlement that was voluntarily agreed. In fact, the so-called deal was presented as the only game in town. If they chose to reject it, workers were told, then the Government would continue to wield the big stick of FEMPI in order to impose a settlement. The proof is in the pudding in this regard because that is exactly what is happening to teachers. This is supposed to be a democratic country but here we have legislation that effectively removes the right to free collective bargaining from trade unions. Even though a majority of unions accepted the deal, this Bill effectively punishes those who did not. It allows any rise offered to some workers to be withdrawn from workers who rejected a pay deal. It copperfastens pay apartheid in the public sector and makes no reference to how and when workers, teachers, for instance, might expect to earn the same pay as colleagues for doing the same work. Nurses are particularly affected by this. These provisions bed down the inferior pensions of new recruits and, years after the crisis has passed, make permanent the various emergency measures in respect of pension entitlements. These measures seek to normalise the financial emergency, just as the Taoiseach is attempting to normalise the emergency in housing.We will have to restate what the Taoiseach sees as a republic of opportunity to see it as a republic of opportunists that favours former taoisigh, Deputies and Ministers who will receive a handsome pension increase with new legislation to be introduced. A lot has been left unsaid about the FEMPI legislation and we will be introducing amendments to this Bill.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I, too, have huge doubts and reservations around this and will be opposing the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017. It is hugely ironic. When I joined the post office in 1979 as a post office clerk, within one year equal pay was introduced for women in the workplace. That legislation came in from Europe as equal pay for work of equal value. Decades on, because the EU banks operated in a loose manner and the EU insisted that Ireland pay for the bank bailout, it is ironic that it is the public sector workers and workers who are paying for that bailout through the measure of unequal pay for public sector workers. Nearly €3 billion has been robbed from the pockets of public sector workers over recent years since the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation was introduced. It has affected some 300,000 public sector workers and this Bill does not do anything to address unequal pay for those workers, especially those in the three teachers' unions, the Defence Forces and nurses. This legislation affects the public service stability agreement. It will compound the continuing inequality for post-2011 public service staff, including teachers, and it will lead to the net pay for most public servants being reduced through the conversion of the pension levy into a permanent pension contribution. That pension levy was temporary. It does not go into the pension. The way it is presented to the public is a misnomer. It goes back to the Government. The three teachers' unions rejected the public service stability agreement. They did so mainly because it does not reverse pay inequality and specifically because it provides that no change can occur to deliver equal pay for the duration of the agreement. Teachers who were appointed in 2011 have already lost more than €26,000 in earnings, in addition to the pay cuts imposed on the more senior colleagues. There is no doubt that this inequality in pay is one of the reasons for the current acute crisis in teacher supply. If passed in its current form, this legislation will be used to try to prevent teachers' unions from taking effective action to deliver equal pay during the lifetime of the public service stability agreement up to 2020. This is because of the statutes contained in the legislation around unions that do not assent to the public service stability agreement. Members of the unions that do not assent will, among other measures, have increments frozen until 2021 and will face the effective continuation of the pension levy for two extra years. The intention is to force the unions which did not accept the agreement to assent to it, ignore the democratic wishes of their members and abandon any effective campaign to progress the just cause of lower-paid teachers and lecturers. The legislation represents a fundamental attack on trade union rights. The democratic right of union members to engage in free collective bargaining has been undermined and the right of members to say no to an unjust agreement is being denied. It should be noted that the legislation provides for the eventual full restoration of the inflated pensions of those who were responsible for the economic crash. Ministers, taoisigh such as Brian Cowen and Bertie Ahern, and others will all receive increased pensions. This legislation, however, does not provide any pathway to equal pay for the lower-paid teachers and lecturers. I believe that the three teachers' unions are also looking at approaching the International Labour Organization on the increments freeze because it breaches the rights of free trade unions. This is in sections 21 and 23 which should be removed. Nurses are affected worse with a starting salary of €28,600. Over the course of the past decade, the low pay has had the effect of undermining the profession. Between 2007 and 2011, the numbers in nursing have declined by 1,500 per year. In December 2007, a total of 39,006 full-time hours were worked and the most recent figures are 36,278. This includes 835 student nurses who are paid the minimum wage. The HSE has confirmed that in 2012, a total of 1,217 nurses graduated and 2,219 left the service. They most likely emigrated. In 2015, a total of 1,130 nurses graduated and 2,382 left the service. As for other therapy grades, nurses are required to have an honours degree and to work 39 hours per week, which is two hours more than the other grades, but they are paid approximately 20% less. This must be changed and we will bring forward amendments to the proposed legislation. The Government should look seriously at the equal pay issue and reinstate equal pay.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	The fact that 90% of public pay will be restored based on the legislation is to be welcomed. The legislation will, however, compound and copperfasten the unequal two-tier system for new entrants. Nurses, gardaí and teachers in particular, and other hugely important front-line staff will not have proper pay restoration under the legislation. These public service workers deserve equal pay for equal work. Instead, inequality is built into the Bill through pay differentials. Those public sector workers who were employed after January 2011 will continue to be discriminated against. Such discrimination and inequality will have been legislated for by Government. The Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland has calculated that teachers who were appointed in 2011 have already lost some €30,000 in earnings, in addition to the pay cuts that were also imposed on their more senior colleagues. Those who began teaching after February 2012 will earn nearly €100,000 less over a 40 year career than a teacher who began prior to 2011. One could make the comparison that if we told any new Deputies elected during the next election that they were to work for less pay than the quare fellas already here, there would be some row. These losses mean that teachers will be paying well into their old age for the mistakes of the boom-bust economics of the past two decades. It is grossly unfair considering that the vast majority of them were students up until the economic downturn and did not benefit financially from the boom, nor did they contribute to the mistakes that caused such hardship. Singling out new public service workers and front-line staff is deeply unfair, unjustified and economically damaging. There is no doubt that people who are on lower incomes are also spending a higher percentage of their direct earnings weekly than those who are better paid. The State and the economy generally benefits when these people are paid better. It is a win-win situation. I do not agree with the rationale of the State paying these workers less, no more than I agreed with the use of austerity to address financial problems. When times are difficult, investment by the State works better because it comes back in different ways. Public servants will also have a lower entry threshold for the additional superannuation contribution. This is supposed to incentivise adherence to the terms of the agreement. It is a bizarre and perverse way of looking at this section of the Bill. The Bill is punitive and is essentially an example of State coercion. It seeks to punish those new entrants to the public service, who are already discriminated against, for simply seeking to assert their rights through collective bargaining. These threats, and that is exactly what they are, will have the most severe effect on the same new and recent entrants to the public service such as gardaí, nurses and teachers who have suffered discrimination and pay inequality simply by virtue of the date they commenced their public service employment. Pay cuts and unequal pay for equal work have been immensely damaging to morale within the public service, which is a big factor. God knows there are enough problems in Departments such as the Department of Justice and Equality without driving down morale even further by refusing to pay new entrants properly.Poor morale in the teaching profession has the potential to be a huge problem and it may lead to a brain drain. One finds teachers going to countries where English is spoken, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and England, to earn a living and get a start in life. The proliferation of temporary contracts and precarious hours adds to the problem for those who do not have full-time contracts. Many new teachers who have been educated and trained in Ireland will go abroad which amounts to a waste of resources and a loss of talent. According to the research, there is a direct correlation between teachers' pay and the quality of education in a country. Those countries which perform best in educational terms are those which attract the best students to teaching by offering them higher salaries and greater professional status. The pay cuts and inequality targeting new teachers will have a detrimental effect on the future quality of education in Ireland. The Bill compounds the problem. The teaching profession has been devalued, making it a less attractive prospect for intelligent, high-achieving young people who are considering their future career choices. We can say the same about new entrant gardaí, nurses and others in the public service. If a teacher is in the job for 20 or 30 years, he or she is very well paid. In fact, because they are so well paid, they are encouraged to stay there forever, even when they are burned out. We are not attracting those young people we need to revitalise the teaching profession and schools. More should be done to get new people in. I do not know how nurses do it. My mother, who is 93, spent three months in hospital three years ago. My God, I could not believe how hard the nurses worked. They were just amazing. They were fantastic but we do not pay them enough and new people coming into the profession are not being treated fairly.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak tonight. Many Deputies have spoken about the inadequacies of the legislation, which need to be emphasised and emphasised again. Last week, we passed the Finance Bill in the House. Parts of the Bill and amendments to it were intended to address the appalling vista that AIB is going to pay no tax in the State for the next 20 years because it can write off its losses on foot of measures introduced and facilitated by the Government. It is galling for workers in the public sector who feel that it is precisely their pay cuts and the reductions in their terms and conditions of employment which were used to fund the bailout of that very same bank. As pensioners in the public sector pointed out to me recently, not only is AIB not paying any tax, it has paid increases to its staff. Public sector pensioners and workers consider those pay increases to have been funded at their expense. It is utterly galling. While we are glad to see any pay restoration as, I am sure, are public sector workers after such a prolonged period of austerity, this is a partial not a full restoration. It is certainly not the pay rise which the current economic situation requires. Years ago, a nurse and a garda who got married would consider themselves to be made up. They were on the pig's back. That is not the case anymore. A nurse and a garda cannot even afford to rent in this city, never mind buy a house in the face of the cataclysmic price increases in the private housing market. Year on year, there have been increases in prices. It was 8% in 2015, 11.8% last year, 12.8% this year and the ESRI predicts that house prices will rise by a further 20% by 2020. Rents increased by over 11% this year and are now 23% ahead of the 2008 level. Somebody starting out in the public sector is not going to be able to put a roof over his or her head. A couple will not even be able to do it. If, God forbid, like many people who get together, they want to have a kid, their problems will really start. They will not be able to fund a crèche, the average weekly cost of which is €174 for one full-time place. We have to point these facts out as a starting point because that is the backdrop to the pay and conditions we expect our public sector workers to endure. In contrast with the spiralling cost of living, the provisions in the Bill are being offered on a piecemeal basis. While 90% sounds good, we should be clear that it is over four years and will not be complete until 2021. God knows what prices will be at that stage. There are a number of very problematic measures in the Bill, as has been pointed out. It fails to reverse the inequality introduced by FEMPI for new entrants. It proposes significant sanctions for members of unions who do not vote in favour of it and it proposes an additional pension contribution for public servants which is, in essence, a permanent pay cut. As such, we are certainly of the view that sections 21 and 33 should be removed from the Bill. Some trade unions have clearly been bullied into accepting the terms because of the chilling effect of a sanction freezing increments if they do not vote in favour of the deal. Obviously, their members are feeling the pinch and need their pay restored after enduring the austerity of the past number of years. However, I am glad that not all unions have backed down. I salute the efforts of the three teacher unions which voted against the deal and publicly stated their opposition to the Bill. They have rightly pointed out that the legislation contains no reversal of the cuts to the starting salaries of their members hired after 2011. In contrast, it reverses the cuts for Members here, ex-taoisigh and so on. Not only does the inbuilt inequality remain; the unions and their members will be tied into those terms for the duration of the deal, namely, until 2021. This is a serious curtailment of the freedom of unions to negotiate on behalf of their members. In addition, the punitive powers contained in the Bill for those unions which vote against the Bill are an attack on the democratic wishes of union members and their freedom to bargain collectively, which is thereby undermined. That is not acceptable. Many points have been made on the inequality new teachers are expected to accept where, let us be clear, they can even manage to achieve a full-time position. Achieving a full-time job comes after years of study and, probably, after years of being kicked around between schools on part-time contracts. It is unfair that they are disadvantaged. There is little point in us crowing about economic growth if we do not make significant investments in education, health and social care. That means paying workers fairly. I will not repeat the points which have been made except to say that the starting salary for teachers recruited after 2011 is just over €30,000 while the average industrial wage is €37,000. On the current teacher pay scale, it takes six years to get to the average industrial wage. For other low-paid civil servants, it is even worse. They need to advance 16 increments on the payscale which is, in effect, a 16 year wait for a living wage. We cannot let the opportunity pass without highlighting the number of our public servants who rely on family income supplement. It is an absolutely ridiculous situation that we have to dip into the social welfare pot because we are not paying our public sector workers enough. The economic impact of that is also ridiculous. These are the people who go to local hairdressers and shops and boost the economy further. I do not have time to go into detail, but the position of nurses is the worst of all. They have a starting salary of €28,600. Low pay in that profession has gutted it. Recruitment numbers are being wiped out by the number of highly qualified and dedicated nurses who have been driven out of the country by longer hours and lower pay. Countries like the UK, USA, Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia are queuing up to employ our nurses who have been trained here. The gutting that has taken place over the last two years is ridiculous. We should emphasise the point that these professions are dominated by women.We waffle on about gender inequality but these are the ones who have been hardest hit. As our qualified nurses are being sought elsewhere and have moved about because of the low pay here, we have the double whammy of the Health Service Executive, HSE, being obliged to recruit nurses from other countries, in the main from the developing world, in a practice that is frowned upon by the International Labour Organization as unethical. We do not have a shortage of personnel here; we just have forced them out through low pay and then we recruit from other countries where they do have a shortage of medical personnel. It is unethical and unacceptable. The Bill will have to be heavily amended to adjust the problems caused by FEMPI.

It provides for pay restoration and some lessening of the public service pension levy. This is welcome when it applies particularly to most public service workers starting on 1 January 2018. It is interesting and extraordinary that the Labour Party has not presented a speaker on this Bill tonight.

#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	374	The process of unwinding FEMPI for professional fees and other payments reduced during austerity years will not commence until 2019 and only then in return for contractual and structural reform, together with productivity and service improvement in line with Government policy. In the health sector this applies to general practitioners, GPs, and pharmacists. This is neither an orderly nor a timely unwinding of FEMPI in respect of GP and pharmacy fees. In that regard the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, intends to undertake a process of engagement with relevant representative bodies during 2018 prior to starting the unwinding of FEMPI for GPs and pharmacists in 2019, which may not affect their fees and payments until 2020. This is entirely unacceptable. There is a clear pathway for salaried public servants but not for contract holders such as GPs and pharmacists. Additionally, the setting and varying of fees for contract holders who were subject to reductions under FEMPI will enshrine FEMPI-style legislation in an alternative statute. This is also unacceptable. Thus FEMPI-style legislation will remain on the Statute Book ad infinitum. Varying the fees can be done by ministerial order, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, based on affordability and value for money, supposedly to protect the taxpayer through fluctuations in our economic cycle. Such reduction in fees can be introduced in the future, following consultation but without negotiation with the contractors involved. Any restoration of these future reductions will have to go through the same tortuous process we are belatedly going through at present. GPs and pharmacists have been subjected to horrendous FEMPI reductions and the unwinding of FEMPI is now being done in a disorderly manner and is putting pressure on those professionals. No GP could plan his or her future on the basis that his or her practice income could be reduced by the Minister of the day as he or she sees fit. Any unwinding of FEMPI for GPs will not commence until 2019 or most likely 2020. This is completely unacceptable. GPs were disproportionately affected by FEMPI as the cuts were applied to the gross public turnover of the practice fee, which included all the expenses incurred in running a practice. The cuts were very deep: 38% reduction in the fees paid to a GP to run the practice. This has had a crippling effect on general practice as a discipline and as a career option for young GPs. They are not entering the profession and the principal reason for that is the disproportionate application of FEMPI to GP fees. GPs have already delivered productivity and to ask them to increase productivity in connection with the unwinding of FEMPI is completely unacceptable. They have delivered this productivity by increased workload and delivering complex care while taking on greater responsibility for chronic care which is now being shifted from the hospital service to the community. GPs are looking after 50% more patients with medical cards than they did when the FEMPI cuts were introduced. The amount of work now expected of general practice has reached saturation point, due to transfer of care from hospital to primary care and the complex needs of an ageing population being looked after in the community. Productivity also has been increased because we are looking after patients who should be looked after in secondary care. The "Prime Time" programme last week demonstrated the difficulties of public patients accessing secondary services, which results in increased GP visits and increased responsibility in looking after these patients in primary care while they wait to access necessary secondary care. GPs who were disproportionately affected by FEMPI are now being additionally disadvantaged by having FEMPI unwound on the long finger and having unacceptable conditions applied to the restoration process by tying its unwinding to contract negotiations. The Sláintecare report proposed a decisive shift towards primary care and social care led by general practice. This will require a significant increase in GP numbers if entitlement to universal primary care is to be introduced over the next few years. Young GPs will not sign up to a contract based on the existing financial model that exists under the present contract and the FEMPI arrangements, which are hobbling general practice. This model of a contract operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year in which the GP pays for everything and takes full financial responsibility is broken. The method of partially unwinding FEMPI enshrined in this Bill will ensure that not only will young GPs continue emigrate but those who are away definitely will not return. Our ageing population of GPs will retire long before they would wish. More than 600 GPs are over the age of 60, that is one quarter of the workforce, and will retire in less than a decade. This uncontrolled and unacceptable unwinding of FEMPI will cripple our already crumbling general practice network. This is at a time when the HSE predicts that we will face a shortfall of 2,000 GPs by 2025. New services cannot be funded by FEMPI restoration, as the financial model is now unsustainable and broken. The Minister cannot expect GPs to accept the unwinding of FEMPI for contractual services which they already give and productivity they already provide.  In Ireland, 3.5% of health expenditure is spent on general practice. In the UK the percentage is 8.1% and it proposes to move to 11%. Ireland is losing its GPs to countries which have better resources and better health services where they have better job satisfaction, career prospects, training opportunities and working conditions. One arm of the State is proposing that we expand GP care, following the Sláintecare report, while another arm is making it financially impossible for GPs to continue in practice or to enter the service.  This Bill gives effect to the public service stability agreement. The three teachers' unions have voted against this agreement because it failed to deal adequately with new entrant pay. This Bill proposes significant sanction for members of unions who have not signed up to this agreement, involving the removal of their increments and the maintenance of higher pension contributions at the level of the current pension levy. These sanctions should be removed by way of amendment to the Bill in order that inequality in pay is not compounded.Thus, sections 21 and 33 should be removed from the Bill. The removal of these sections will not interfere with the implementation of the agreement for those who have accepted the public service stability agreement. This is driving our young graduates out of the country. It is driving them into financial difficulties with housing, jobs and job security. It is really unacceptable that professionals should be subject to this FEMPI unwinding, which makes no sense whatsoever. Certainly as it relates to general practice, if this is how the Government will unwind FEMPI, it will finally cripple general practice.

The Bill also provides for the unwinding of financial emergency measures on public service pay and pensions on a phased basis. The justification for the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 was the economic crisis and financial emergency which beset the country. By the Government's own pronouncement the financial emergency has now passed. The Government is shortchanging a lot of people. I was here when FEMPI was passed and I probably voted for it.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	I did and fair enough. We had to. The Government will not catch people out like that again. The emergency has passed. The Minister for Finance and others were telling the whole country and the world during the last election about the recovery, but it forgot to think the recovery did not go outside the Red Cow. The recovery must be afraid of the cow. It must think it is a bull and it cannot get out past it, but it cannot get down the country anyway. As I said, we must deal with ordinary people who are putting their shoulder to the wheel when asked. They have made sacrifices and what are they getting? They are getting a slap in the face and are told to get lost and eat cake. That is what they are being told, as they were told by the famous lady across the pond. Deputy Harty has eloquently spoken about the GPs and what is happening there with the drain of GPs and the frustration. The Government must remember all GPs are self-employed people who not only under the hippocratic oath do their best to cure people's health and look after people, but also employ a plethora of people and they pay rates, wages and insurance. Deputy Harty got elected on the no doctor no village campaign and he is dead right. What do we want? Do we want people to die on the sides of the road? Deputy Harty gave the figures on the numbers of people being treated by GPs instead of in accident and emergency departments. Accident and emergency departments are inaccessible and the Government does not want people in there and that is quite obvious. GPs pay staff, including nurses and receptionists. They have all types of services, such as chiropodists, and they provide a great service. They need to be supported before they are all gone. We know what the Minister said at the last election. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 to 2015 have been used to cut public sector workers' pay and pensions as well as those of general practitioners, as I said. I also want to mention local authority workers and ordinary workers in the HSE and Departments. They are getting the brunt of it, and I salute them for how they have championed it. Many of them have left. Many of them are on family income supplement. I spoke to a man this evening who is an excellent local authority worker in Clonmel whose wife is a nurse. They are fleeced and it is not fair. They put up with it for a while for the emergency but the emergency has gone. The Government still has a punitive tax regime brought in for an emergency, and for which we voted, but we have been double-crossed and the people have been double-crossed. It is time the Government sat up and listened. Deputy Wallace said that type of apartheid system would not be accepted here. We met teachers this evening who are protesting. I also blame the trade unions. They have a responsibility. They got into bed with the Government and negotiated the deals by which they knew their influence would be less than before. They have to take some of the blame themselves. The head guys there are not badly paid either. Let us be fair and honest. We vote for something and support it when it is needed, but we will not keep supporting something that is not needed. It is a con job and the people are being conned. The ordinary workers, whom we expect in the storms to grit the roads in the frost and to keep accident and emergency departments open, are not getting a fair crack of the whip and they are tired. They are tired of waiting. I said before, they were waiting in the long grass for the Government at the last election and they were. They got stuck under the tufts of grass like the hares and hid and survived, but they are coming at the Government again because they are not fools. They can see what is going on. They have given the service and they have done the State some service and now it is time to treat them with some modicum of respect. The continued use of emergency legislation in the absence of an emergency would amount to an abuse of Government power - it does amount to an abuse of power - and it is disproportionate. One example of the way FEMPI has led to serious consequences in terms of the health infrastructure is the cuts imposed on general practitioners. These were savage cuts of 35% or 40%. No one could sustain that. The National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, has called on the Government to reverse urgently the FEMPI cuts in general practice. The Government is not listening. It speaks about negotiating a new contract with the two doctors' organisations. The contract is 40 years old. No Third World country would have a contract that old and out of date. The Government has been talking about negotiating it for the longest time but when will it do it? They have been disproportionately cut. I salute the GPs, particularly those in rural towns and the few left in rural villages, because they have kept the service. They have kept faith with the people. They are providing a service and getting damn little for it, only cuts and cuts. The NAGP has also said that FEMPI was a key factor in the high rate of emigration among GPs, as the profession is not now viable in Ireland. That is a very telling statement. Huge money from their families, taxpayers and the Government is invested in GP training and what are they doing? They are going off to foreign lands and it is a shame and a pity. We should have some way to attract them back, but they will not come back if it is not attractive. We see this every day in rural Ireland and we cannot get doctors or GPs to apply for practices. This is what the HSE tells us and what it wants. It wants to get rid of rural GPs. It tells us it advertises and cannot get people to apply. It suits the HSE. It is a big monopoly that does not care about rural Ireland. It wants to see us without a doctor. It wants to see us in pain. People are going blind and we are bussing them up to the North to get treatment. People cannot walk because of their hips. There will be some amount of people bouncing into the polling booths at the next election to get rid of the Government, because they will be able to see the ballot paper and they will have thrown away the sticks, and they will be mad to jump into a car to be brought to vote, and they know how they will vote and it will not be for Fine Gael. The Labour Party was mentioned. Cá bhfuil siad? It is like Cill Chais. Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan Páirtí an Lucht Oibre? It is not even here for the debate. It is irrelevant now. I have said for the past five years it was interested in nothing but the liberal agenda. We cannot feed people with the liberal agenda and its members found out that to their cost. They cannot pay the mortgage or house the people, so where are they? We had a debate on rural crime recently and there was not one Labour Party Deputy here for it. We have a debate tonight on this issue-----

They are getting a break and they will get a longer break than they are looking for if they are not careful. The Labour Party Deputies are not here for these Bills or debates. They were not here last week either for the debate on rural crime. It was a proud party founded in Clonmel in Tipperary, but God help us. As I said, the NAGP chief executive has stated that FEMPI is driving GPs abroad in search of better terms and conditions. They can get them and they are over here recruiting all of the time. The previous Taoiseach made many commitments, and even had posters and billboards saying he was going to get rid of the trolley crisis. However, we cannot get doctors and the doctors we have here are mistreated. Go into any accident and emergency department and one will see the mistreatment. We cannot get the doctors and the trolleys are longer and there are more trolleys than ever. There were 9% more managers in the HSE in 2016 compared to 2015. We need to be fair and respectful to the people on the front line who put their shoulders to the wheel. There are 9% more managers. What are they managing? Chaos, the vast majority of the time. We have ward managers, floor managers, bed managers, linen managers and hygiene managers and they do not have pillows, pillowcases or blankets in Clonmel accident and emergency department most of the time. We have all of these managers and what are they managing? Absolute chaos, with trolleys out the door and that is the way the Government seems to want it, but we do not have the doctors or the nurses. The Minister tells us about growth of 6% or 12% and that we are the fastest growing economy. People are getting sick of seeing this. They do not see it in their pockets. The Government does not seem to realise these people are the movers and shakers. When they have a decent bit of money they spend it locally. They spend it on their families. They spend it on food, services in their houses and improving their lot. They regenerate the rural economy. This is a false economy.Something like this cannot be kept in place when its time has elapsed. The dogs in the street know that. It is false, misleading and trickery of the highest order to keep that legislation in place. This Bill does little or nothing to deal with that. It must deal with it because it is totally unfair and morally wrong. The Minister is empty of empathy for lower-paid people, the GPs and those in other sectors such as council workers. These are ordinary people. Gardaí are also being mistreated. The assistant commissioner could decide last night on a whim that there was no more money to pay the gardaí overtime until next January. The Taoiseach this morning was not sure whether it was this year's pay, next year's pay or what pay they are getting. He did not seem to care either. That instruction was sent out. It is only when there are no gardaí to mind the gate here that the Government will start thinking about the gardaí. It all appears to be on the Government's terms. It is what suits the Government, not what suits Johnny, Mary, Tommy, Biddy or anybody else in the country.

It includes oppressive measures which are not included in the recent public service pay agreement. It also includes punishments for trade unionists whose unions do not agree to the new industrial relations agreement proposed by their employers. Among these is an increment freeze which is essentially a punishment pay cut, the industrial relations equivalent of a punishment beating. How can members of the Independent Alliance, including the Ministers of State, Deputy Finian McGrath and Deputy John Halligan, support this attack on the rights of free trade unions? I will propose amendments to delete the increment freeze and other punishment measures. This Bill is a breach of the freedom of association under the International Labour Organization conventions. I received an email today from a trade union activist who rightly pointed out that this Bill is an inducement for workers to leave and remain outside trade unions. He refers to Part 1, section 3 and Part 1, section 3(6) of the Bill. He says that in that circumstance if at least one of the recognised trade unions or staff associations notifies to the Workplace Relations Commission its assent to the agreement in writing then a public servant in that grade or category who is not a member of a union will not be deemed a non-covered public servant and will escape the punishment measures. He went on to say that it is easy to envisage a situation where one union assents to the agreement and another does not. The direct implication is that members of the non-assenting union can simply leave their union and so escape the punishments being meted out to members of that union. He makes the point that this is a direct financial inducement in legislation to trade union members to leave their union or, looked at another way, blackmail threatened against those who choose to remain. He notes that it is also, in some cases, a contractual inducement in terms of accelerating contracts of indefinite duration which may be withdrawn as part of the punishments, as has been inflicted recently on members of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI. A number of unions are opposed to the measures in the Bill. The Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, has asked members to contact their public representatives about it. I received a letter today from a member of the TUI and I will read it into the record. It states:I am requesting that you, as a public representative in my constituency, seek amendments to the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017 to remove the unacceptable threats it contains. ... This Bill represents an oppressive effort by Government to coerce compliance with a national agreement that, in its current form, leaves gross injustice intact in terms of a continuing regime of pay inequality for those who entered the profession since 1 January 2011. The three main teachers' unions have voted against the public service stability agreement in national ballots. The main reason in each case is the acceptance that the agreement would halt progress in the campaign for pay equality for a further three years. ... The punitive draconian consequences for members of unions not covered by the agreement mapped out in this Bill are disproportionate and unprecedented. They include a freeze on increments for three years and a nine month delay of pay restoration measures. These threats would have the most severe effect on the same new and recent entrants to the public service who have suffered discrimination and pay inequality by virtue simply of the date that they commenced their public service employment. ... As my local representative I urge you to reject the oppressive approach set out in the Bill and urge that you seek amendments that remove these unacceptable threats.Basically, this Bill provides for a two-tier pay structure that discriminates against public servants who started employment after 1 January 2011. This has created a huge recruitment and retention difficulty in various areas of the public service, including the health service and education. It affects nurses, doctors, teachers, gardaí and public servants who commenced employment since 1 January 2011. It is important to note that the attacks on trade unionists who are not party to the public service stability agreement are not in the trade union agreement itself. They are only in this Bill. This is an attempt by the Government to blackmail Deputies into supporting an attack on the right to free trade unions and the right to freedom of association under the International Labour Organization's conventions. The Minister says the Bill represents a complete unwinding of emergency measures. Does that mean this anti-trade union Bill is a model for future permanent industrial relations legislation? The failure to repeal the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 power to certify a financial emergency every June retains the possibility of new emergency pay and pension cuts being enacted in new FEMPI legislation. A number of unions have sought to have the sanctions against uncovered employees removed. This Bill is fundamentally flawed in this respect. The Government must withdraw the anti-trade union sections of the Bill, including the punishments or sanctions sections. Of course, the Bill provides for pay increases for those who are already very well paid, including Members of the Oireachtas, and for significant pension increases for 30 former Ministers and taoisigh. In fact, it provides for an increase of €15,000 per year in pensions to the former taoisigh, Mr. Bertie Ahern and Mr. Brian Cowen, and slightly smaller increases for other former taoisigh. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, will have a pension of €152,000 per year. On the other hand, new entrants to the public service will not get a pay increase of even 1 cent.This is significant and vicious discrimination against low-paid public servants. I will be proposing an amendment to bring about pay equality between all public servants. There is no proposal in this Bill to improve the atrocious pension scheme imposed on new entrants. It would be illegal in the private sector because there is no effective employer contribution. On the other hand, former taoisigh and Ministers who already have significant pensions are entitled to significant increases as high as €15,000 per year while pay increases are available for Deputies and Senators. The other aspect of this Bill is the question of the emergency. In the explanatory memorandum, the Minister speaks about a full unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts through this measure. This is, of course, incorrect. The Bill fails to repeal subsection (2) of section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013. This section, which enables the Government to certify the continuation of a financial emergency before 30 June of each year, remains. This allows the Government to continue retaining a portion of the private property of pensioners and even to bring in new pension cuts. This is despite the fact that the former Minister for Finance confirmed on a number of occasions, for example when speaking before the Committee on Budget Oversight, that the emergency is over. The former Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, also declared that the financial emergency was over. However, this section of the FEMPI legislation of 2013 still remains in force in accordance with this Bill. I appeal to Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Fianna Fáil to stop the attacks on the rights of free trade unions, to withdraw the punishment sections in this Bill, to end the injustice caused to new entrants and to end the financial emergency by repealing the relevant section of the 2013 Act. If these amendments are not made during the progress of this Bill through the House, particularly on Committee Stage, I will certainly oppose and vote against this Bill.

The public service stability agreement is a welcome initiative because it starts and paves the way for the continuing unwinding of what has been a very difficult journey for our public servants, especially from 2009 to 2013. As Deputy Mattie McGrath noted, we had no choice but to introduce what were financial emergency measures. Deputy Calleary and others have been very responsible in their contributions and have acknowledged the actual state of the country at the time the financial emergency measures were introduced while others, unfortunately, are looking backwards with some rose-tinted view. We must look back at the state of the country at the time. The wheels had literally come off the proverbial wagon and there was a need for our public servants to make a contribution above and beyond, which they did. It is also worth bearing in mind that this happened against the backdrop of being able to maintain continuing industrial peace in the country. In dealing with this legislation, it is important that we pay tribute to the public servants who kept the doors of our public services open in that intervening period, not just front-line services but back office services as well. Oftentimes, these are the hidden public servants within the public services. We need to acknowledge them for that. We are on a very clear road to recovery and we have all acknowledged this in the House. We need to make sure the sustainability we have in terms of where we are economically is measured, sustained and realistic. This agreement and the legislation setting out the provisions for it are different for a number of reasons. First, it paves the way for a totally different climate of industrial relations between the Government and public servants in a way that may not have been done previously. I pay tribute to the responsible attitude and nature of the public service unions and the officials in my Department led by the Minister regarding what was quite a difficult backdrop. It is worth bearing in mind that the negotiations for this agreement which we are putting on a legislative footing as part of this legislation did not come about with, as we would have referred to previously, a thumping majority in the House. They came about with a careful and measured negotiated position led by the Minister with no small help from the main Opposition party, which has also shown responsibility about how this legislation has been brought to where it is today. Deputy Mattie McGrath rightly pointed out that there are some Opposition parties that did not even turn up for this debate. It tells us an awful lot about their commitment to the restoration of public service pay. The cheap seats in the Opposition and those who flunked their responsibility regarding providing a Government in this country have again regurgitated, as they have done in previous debates, the same old tired mantra about how there should be money for everything even though there might be a budget for nothing. This really is not what the people outside this House want to hear and it is certainly not something the public servants themselves want to hear. I know this from personal experience because I was one of these newly qualified public servants in 2008 who went back and requalified and came out with many of my contemporaries to find a country that was banjaxed with little or no opportunities to get a job in the public service. During that period, we recognised that as newly qualified teachers, as I was, this was something that was going to be really difficult and painful but at the same time, we understood what we were getting into and that there would be a pathway to recovery once the economy began to recover. That pathway has been continued as part of the current agreement. The Minister has committed with the Department to continue discussions with those who are called the newly qualified to make sure a trajectory can be put in place during which that can be realised over time. It is not simplistic nor do I believe that anybody thinks it is simplistic, something that can just waved over or a place we can get to overnight. I do not think anybody really believes that. The most important thing that is believable is that there is a commitment from this Government and the Department in collaboration with the partnership model that is available with the unions to deal with this over time as the economy continues to grow. The continuing growth rates in the economy will be one of the main factors that will decide whether we are able to continue with agreements like this in the first instance. If we do not continue to have the rates of growth we have enjoyed over recent years, particularly in the recent past, we will not be in a position to deliver on the three years or subsequent to the three years which we are committing to in this legislation. That is very important. It is also important to point out that it is not just the Government here providing restoration. Deputy Bríd Smith was right.It is the only thing I agree with in her contribution. These are not pay rises; they are restorations. It is getting people back to a former situation over a period of time. That is not the only thing. There is also a major change to how we deal with superannuation, which also has to be recognised. The Minister said that in his opening remarks. It is a very welcome change because it makes the future pension requirements of public servants more sustainable. We will be able to budget for it, cost it and meet it. It was a looming problem for the Government for a period but, thanks to the work that has been done, which is enshrined in the Bill, we will be in a far stronger position to deliver it in future. There will be challenges ahead. As the agreement beds in and there are further negotiations and discussions, formal and informal, with the Government and Minister, there will be challenges. There is a strong blueprint now, however, to make sure we have sustainability into the future that gets us over this three-year hump and allows us to look at more ambitious programmes for public service pay restoration, in conjunction with the continued delivery of hours, extra work and responsibilities that are in place. In addition, we will also grow our public services. The embargo is gone in many cases and we are able to reinstate people whose jobs could not be filled. The only reason we could do that is because we maintained industrial peace in our public services. I pay tribute to our public servants for that. As well as that, we were able to show the outside world, borrowers and lenders, that we were capable of keeping the doors of the country open and meet our international financial obligations. In that way, we made sure we could continue to borrow and access finances to keep our public services going. The Bill is the next and very important step. There has been some delay in bringing it to the House, through no fault of the Department or the Minister, but it is a very important step. It is very important that the Bill is enacted before the end of the year because in doing so, it allows 1 January 2018 to happen in a completely different context from 1 January 2017. They are all very important. Deputies have said they will raise particular issues on Committee and Report Stages. They should bear in mind that it is a money Bill. The public servants who have signed up to it as part of the agreement are very anxious to make sure it is implemented. While there will always be challenges in legislation like this that unwinds some of the most difficult impositions by the State on public servants, it will never be idyllic overnight. However, it will certainly be a vast improvement on where we were. I urge Deputies to work with the Government, Minister and officials in the Department to make sure we can deliver on what is in the Bill in light of the continuing need for reform and continuing development of our public services. At the same time, we should make sure that we can show to the world that we have sound public services that are responsible and which always had the level of industrial peace their leadership in the unions maintained.  As a teacher, I encourage my former colleagues to look again at the agreement in place and to see what is on offer. I understand the difficulties and concerns, and I empathise with them because I am a teacher, but this is the best route available for teachers. Three unions are outside the framework of this agreement. When the legislation is passed, it will not mean the train leaves the station for people who want to demonstrate that they will adhere to the spirit of the agreement. As a teacher and somebody who knows the men and women on the front line who turn up every day and are really strong public servants, I encourage newly qualified teachers and those with long service to work with the Department and their leadership to ensure continued industrial peace that allows us to grow the economy and deliver more reform and improvements like those in this Bill. I have some time remaining so my colleague in the Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, will contribute on the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. I compliment the work of the officials and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for the leadership he has provided and the unions for the responsible nature in which they have taken to the Bill. It is a very progressive step forward for Ireland and our continued economic growth. Ultimately, nobody in the House has a monopoly on concern for our public servants. We are all here trying to do our best by public servants because we are all public servants and we all work hand in glove with them. We want to make sure that what we do is realistic and sustainable and does not in any way heighten expectations we cannot deliver on. I add my support to the Bill.

When this legislation started going through the House in 2008, Fianna Fáil was on this side of the House and we were on the Opposition side. The options were limited and we were going through a particularly scary period. Anyone who has heard me talk about where we have come from and where we are now will know I describe the last decade as the lost decade. It is not just the last decade. There were many difficulties for many people in that period. Some people emigrated but some people who were in the public service did not have the opportunity to emigrate. They had full-time, pensionable, permanent jobs and the FEMPI legislation had a severe impact on those people. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, has spoken about it. They got on with the job and have to be commended on that. That lost decade was really difficult. How did that lost decade occur? It happened because our income collapsed. Our structures were based on income streams that were not consistent or sustainable. The one we all know best is stamp duty. It vanished overnight because the construction sector closed. We went from building 90,000 units to building fewer than 9,000. The stream of €8 billion from those units was gone in the space of 18 months, but our expenditure stream did not collapse. We still had public servants, civil servants and pensions to pay along with the social protection Bill. We hear a lot from our friends on the left about wealth redistribution and how it does not occur in the State. In 2011, when we were at the lowest point of our returns from income tax - it was €11 billion - the social protection budget was €21 billion. That is the extent to which we were caught by income versus expenditure. We had a number of remarkable years in which there were huge differences in expenditure and income. We had to borrow. The national debt increased by about €140 billion in that period. Everybody focuses on the bank debt of about €30 billion. In 2007, the national debt was about €40 billion and the banks cost an additional €30 billion. That is €70 billion. Over that ten-year period, the national debt increased by €140 billion, which is an average of €14 billion a year. Its purpose was to keep the economy going. The average debt accumulated was €14 billion per annum for ten years but nobody wants to talk about that. Public servants and civil servants played their part by being responsible. They knew the difficulty we were in and they got on with it. That has to be said. Their payment was reduced. There was absolutely no option and they got on with it. They should be complimented because they worked harder, longer and better for less take-home pay.I have just finished a period of flying around Europe to work on the bid for the European Banking Authority. Other countries are trying to make some of the changes that we have made in the past decade. Because we made those changes in the past decade, and could introduce a balanced and sustainable budget for 2018, we are now in a position to reverse the FEMPI cuts, to put that period behind us and move on, which is really remarkable. We now move to the next stage which will be covered by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. We have challenges ahead in that three-year period, but our structures are solid and secure, and have been tested. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, today complimented the budget for 2018. Brexit is a major challenge. There is another challenge in the equity markets. If practically all the equity markets continue to make new records, a correction will come within the next two to three years. We are satisfied that we can afford to pay for it and therefore we will do it. I wish to raise the issue of the FEMPI reversal in respect of the GPs' cuts. There is a real issue for the rural small practices. If it can possibly be looked at, we should look at it. I am not saying we can, but it is something we need to consider. We have issues in rural areas and this is something that will have an impact. We should consider it, if at all possible. As I said, our numbers are tight. We are looking at them and we need to consider these issues in the longer term to ensure we continue to have rural GP practices. I hear many people talking about the closure of rural Ireland; I absolutely dispute that, but this is an area we need to look at. I remember having these conversations with Deputy Thomas Byrne when we were both in the other House. We moved from that space to where we are today. In this jurisdiction we are very slow to pay compliments to people who have stepped up. The Civil Service stepped up. Civil servants did not complain and go marching. They did not do what happened in other jurisdictions. As a result of that, I compliment all of them. I compliment the public service and Civil Service unions which were extremely responsible in the most difficult times. Even when other people in other unions were using words like "treacherous" and "treasonous", they were not treacherous or treasonous. Those in the public sector unions were patriotic.

I thank my colleagues and the Ministers for their contributions. I am reminded of a little bit of history. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, spoke about the responsible attitude we are taking and I welcome his appreciation of that. Like the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, I have very strong memories of some of the original FEMPI legislation passing through the House. That same responsible attitude we are demonstrating today was not always in evidence from the Opposition side. Now that they are in government, I am glad they have changed that particular attitude. Deputy Mattie McGrath said he probably voted for it, but he actually forgets, because he voted for it before he voted against it. On one particular occasion that I will never forget, I was the intermediary between the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, and him. I negotiated that Brian Lenihan would introduce a 90% bankers' bonus tax in the legislation to keep Deputy Mattie McGrath on board. However, in the hour or two between Second Stage, and Report and Final Stages, Deputy Mattie McGrath had changed his vote. Those were difficult times, but they were more difficult for the people affected by the FEMPI legislation, as all sides have acknowledged. Many people put up with considerable hardship at the time. I will never forget the emails and other communication I received at that time from public servants and others who were taking a big hit as the economy went into a tailspin. There was a job to be done to get the economy back on an even keel. I am so glad that I stood with our Minister for Finance at the time, Brian Lenihan, and my leader at the time, Brian Cowen, in implementing really difficult legislation. It is a wonderful privilege and honour to be in Dáil Éireann as we see this FEMPI legislation being unwound and the benefits going back to those in the public sector. Fianna Fáil is happy to do that. I do not intend to delay, but, as education spokesperson, I wish to set out our position on newly qualified teachers in particular. It is really important that Government gets the message that this is a running sore in the education sector. As only Members from the centre parties are left in the Chamber - the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, spoke about this - we really need to ensure that the newly qualified people are looked after. They are looking to other areas in the political spectrum for answers, which is not necessary. I believe the centre parties should be offering this. It was a huge disappointment to me that the pay talks were able to go through without the issue of newly qualified people being dealt with. It was very unwise of the negotiators to do that. However, that is the pay agreement we are left with and we have to implement it. I am sure the Minister will talk about this. The pay agreement makes provision for work to be done in respect of those newly qualified people. It is urgent to do that and to get resolution. As an Opposition party, we cannot propose financial changes to the legislation. However, Deputy Calleary has proposed amendments which will require the Minister to carry out a review to find out what can be done as quickly as possible. I want to make clear that Fianna Fáil is committed to equalising the pay scales as soon as we can do that. It should not take a huge amount of time. That is a matter for budgets and for negotiations. We are committed to doing that because it is the right thing to do. It is causing division and dissent in classrooms. It is causing division beyond classrooms in wider society as people feel they are on one side of a divide. It feeds into a radical ideology in politics which is wrong and unfortunate. It also a major contributor to the teacher shortage we have. The perception and the reality is that newly qualified teachers are not getting paid properly. The current teacher shortage is the thing that will pull the rug from under the plans of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the school sector. He cannot do anything in education without teachers. This is an aspect that needs to be addressed and we urge the Government to do that. We will be supporting the Bill. I do not know how anybody could vote against the pay rises proposed. I know Deputy Calleary's amendments will help the situation. Our political commitment on this remains. It is a strong commitment to equalise those scales and do something that is right, fair and just.

I will be brief because I am up against the clock. I acknowledge the Minister is in the Chamber to hear our contributions. When the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI Act was introduced, it was a difficult time in this House, nationally and for the people who suffered as a result of it. Any measure that supports the reinstatement of public service pay must be welcomed. We must welcome this legislation in light of all the different sectors that will be positively affected by it. I refer to the teachers, local authority staff, nurses, gardaí and so on. They have come through a very difficult time. We must put whatever we can back into their pockets through salary increases. This Bill is welcome in that regard. I have met a number of different groups in this regard, particularly teachers in the case of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, who have found it extremely difficult in recent times, particularly regarding the way in which their pay scales have been dealt with, on foot of which teachers who are equally qualified and do the same job now find they are on different pay scales. That can be very disheartening for individuals in the workplace and in general and it creates an atmosphere across all divides and all sectors. It is critically important to rectify those inadequacies and to have public service pay reinstatement and increases put in place as quickly as possible, which will also help those people in terms of the cost of living. Currently, if people in any those sectors are trying to rent a property, never mind purchase one, it is impossible to for them to do so because of the situation in terms of their salaries, which will not even allow them to rent in places like Kildare or in areas outside the Dublin commuter belt. Therefore, the legislation is very important. An advantage of it is that will attract our qualified professionals back home to assist in filling the vacancies we find difficult to fill. We must look upon the Bill as positive in that regard. I fully support the Bill. I acknowledge the sacrifices that have been made by people in the public service, and I welcome the pay reinstatement and salary increases for them. However small it will be, it is a step in the right direction, and it must be welcomed.
