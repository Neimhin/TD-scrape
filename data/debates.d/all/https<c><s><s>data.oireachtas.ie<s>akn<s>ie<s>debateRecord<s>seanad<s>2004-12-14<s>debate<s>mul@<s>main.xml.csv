These regulations concern a reduction in the disease levies applied to milk delivery for processing and cattle slaughtered or exported to facilitate the eradication of TB and brucellosis in cattle.The rates have been reviewed in light of the improving disease situation and, as a consequence, there has been a reduction in the costs of the scheme; No. 2, Road Traffic Bill 2004 — Committee Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 2 p.m.; No. 3, Health Bill 2004 — Committee Stage, to be taken at 3 p.m. and to conclude no later than 6 p.m.; No. 4, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 — all Stages, to be taken at 6 p.m. and to conclude no later than 8 p.m.; and No. 5, Garda Síochána Bill 2004 — Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at 8 p.m. and to conclude no later than 10 p.m. There will be a sos between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	5	It is good news. My party also welcomes Fianna Fáil's proposal to devote its Private Members' business tomorrow to a debate on Northern Ireland.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	7	We appreciate the decision to arrange a two-hour debate on the matter tomorrow, which will allow Senators to discuss the important issues at stake.In the last two weeks, Senators have called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow residency to be granted to the parents of Irish children who were born in this State. According to newspaper reports today, it seems the Government intends to allow up to 17,000 families to remain in this country. I welcome the Government's new humane position in this regard. The arguments made in this House were based on the Supreme Court decision. It is right and proper that Ireland should grant residency to people whose children were born in this country. I compliment the many groups outside this House which have campaigned, lobbied and argued this case in recent months. While I welcome the proposed Government decision, I would like to know whether it will make the change by means of legislation or ministerial order. Can the Leader clarify the matter?The independent commission established to examine Dáil boundaries produced its report approximately eight months ago, but legislation to that effect has not yet been brought to the Oireachtas. I presume a Bill will be introduced early in the new year. When an independent commission produces a report of this nature, it is important that it be brought before the House for its consideration. There are controversial issues in the report, not least the proposed changes to the status of County Leitrim. The matter should be brought before the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	8	When the Seanad dealt with the Immigration Bill 2004 and a motion on the matter, Senators pressed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue of Irish citizens who were born here. The Minister took a strong position on getting the legislation through at that time, but he promised to take a pragmatic and open view of the matter after it had been enacted. When he said that he would not close the door on Irish citizens, we wondered if he would stick to his word. I am happy to note that the Minister is as good as his word and I welcome his decision to find ways of dealing with the matter. We have a moral and ethical imperative to look after the families of children born in Ireland. I hope the 17,000 families will be dealt with in a pragmatic manner. It is quite fair and in order for the Minister to consider that the new system will be open to those who act honestly with the authorities. I refer to people of good character who seek to live in this country in a self-sufficient manner. I have always asked that we take such a practical approach to the matter, rather than having a closed mind.Although the Houses were not sitting yesterday afternoon, there was a very enthusiastic demonstration outside the gates of Leinster House involving young, energetic and enthusiastic student teachers from the various colleges of education. It brought me back to my youth and it was great to see them. They are the kind of people one would be delighted to see in charge of and moulding the next generation of schoolchildren and leaders. They were making the very simple demand that they should be recognised for what they are and that there should be jobs available to them.Members know that class sizes are still far too large. We need the student teachers in the schools and therefore I ask the Minister for Education and Science, who is now a couple of months in the job, to outline in the House her plans regarding teacher numbers and teacher supply. She should recognise that student teachers who spend many months in schools teaching, learning and improving their methods should be entitled to claim an allowance or pay during those months, just as nurses, gardaí and others get paid while they are on the job during their training periods. I would like the Minister to outline to the House how she intends to provide for the future of those brilliant young student teachers.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I join Senator O'Toole in welcoming the decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the non-national parents of Irish-born children who are seeking asylum in this country. The Minister was in the House last week and I noted that he is one of those people who likes to play good cop and bad cop at the same time. Even when he is announcing something generous, he likes to do it in a fashion that sounds harsh. However, it appears that, in this instance, he has taken the more compassionate route. It is appropriate that we should salute and welcome his decision.We have heard reports today on the purchase of the Irish assets of National Australia Bank by Danske Bank. It is probably fair to say that National Irish Bank has had a very chequered history in Ireland. When it first arrived, it was very much welcomed and seemed to bring a competitive edge to the retail market that had not existed previously. We later discovered that this had come about, at least in part, through means that were at least questionable if not unethical or illegal. In fairness to the bank, it has cleaned up its act. We welcome Danske Bank into the Irish banking sector. We have received a timely reminder that small businesses find it very difficult to obtain loans at decent or reasonable interest rates. I hope the emergence into the Irish banking sector of a retail bank with a commitment to address this issue will make a serious difference in years to come.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I, too, welcome the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding immigrants. It is very important because asylum seekers are subject to innuendo in many rural communities, where they are perceived to be almost wandering around aimlessly. Terminology such as "freeloaders" is sometimes used, which is a bit harsh. The beneficial aspect of the Minister's decision will be that it will bring people out of the twilight zone and restore the dignity of the non-national parents of children born in Ireland. It is extremely important to include such people in the workplace because this will increase the respectability attached to all immigrants in their position.I understand the electronic voting machines that were mothballed are to be used on an experimental basis to convince the commission and the electorate that they are usable. This is probably laudable given that €51 million was spent on them. However, it is worth reminding the House that the main objection to them in the first place was the absence of a verifiable paper audit trail.The Government should ascertain whether the machines can be configured to achieve a verifiable paper audit trail, otherwise the whole exercise could be brought into disrepute again. There may be an attempt to use the machines in the referendum to be held in the near future. While this is important, it is equally important to fine-tune the system, implement it fairly and respect the concerns of the public. The unfortunate former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who attempted to introduce the electronic voting system, was caught in a PR exercise. We would not like to see the same error repeated by the new Minister in that Department. The Minister should exercise caution in what he seeks to achieve in this area.

In the course of the campaign it was pointed out that more people are killed by knives than by guns yet the possession of a gun carries a stiff penalty. We must take the same view of knives because someone who goes out at night carrying a knife intends to use it. Knives have been used in different types of crime, for example, in theft when people have lost their lives, crimes of passion and so on. Such a course of action would send out a message to those who consider carrying a knife as a weapon they can use at a whim. We could discuss this with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A knife in this context is no different from a gun and should be treated accordingly.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	13	As one who comes from a former southern Unionist background, who is not a Roman Catholic or a republican, and is a Nationalist in as far as I love this country, I commend the Taoiseach on the extraordinary patience, skill and dignity with which he mustered the ability to make a long telephone call to Dr. Ian Paisley yesterday. That shows considerable grit and he increased his stature by so doing. The same dignity was not reflected on the other side.With regard to the issue of photographs, the IRA is very sensitive. It was not quite so sensitive when it put up imitation road signs saying Sniper at Work, and did not seem to worry about the impact they would have on people such as the family of Stephen Rosterick. Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party need to grow up and give the majority of decent people in this country a chance to live their ordinary lives.Will the Leader ask the appropriate Minister — perhaps it should be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — to consider the naming in newspapers of people accused of crimes? Last week, all the newspapers, including the principal papers of record, carried the name, age, occupation and address of somebody accused of having child pornography on a computer. This is a very nasty offence but the man is innocent until proven guilty. He has already been punished by the newspapers. He had a defence, as people usually do, and it may well be one that works. What is the situation for him and his family after all this? This type of procedure should be stopped. It is not right and it does not respect the principle that people are innocent until proven guilty.I welcome the statements from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the immigrant families of babies born here. We had a good, detailed, well-informed, well-briefed debate in the Seanad in which the Minister participated fully and took on board many of the things said on all sides of the House. This issue was not one of the Opposition versus the Government. We have arrived at a more humane situation than that which might have obtained. It was work well done.
#EddieBohan	unknown-#EddieBohan-party	unknown-#EddieBohan-dob	unknown-#EddieBohan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Will the Leader bring to the attention of the appropriate Minister the increased charges on toll bridges, particularly the M50? It is an outrage that the people managing the tolls are allowed to increase the charges by at least 20% when inflation is running at approximately 2.5%.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Hear, hear.

#EddieBohan	unknown-#EddieBohan-party	unknown-#EddieBohan-dob	unknown-#EddieBohan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	18	It is absolute greed and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. The unfortunate people who must come to work in the morning and go home in the evening through those toll gates are being ripped off. I ask the Leader to bring this issue to the attention of the Minister concerned to see what can be done about it.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I welcome the comments of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the parents of Irish-born children. It is a welcome move and I compliment him. I now ask him to consider the many thousands of families accommodated in direct provision, in particular in Mosney. Families are living in such accommodation for years. It is not appropriate for young children to grow up in an atmosphere where they never see their parents cook a meal or do normal family activities, as would be the case in household accommodation. The Minister should continue his good work and address this problem.It will come as no surprise that a CSO survey published in the past couple of days shows women earn one third less than their male counterparts, and are still the principal carers of children. Many women with young children under the age of three years choose to stay at home. That may be due to a lack of child care facilities, or it may be because parents decide it is in the better interests of their children that one parent stays at home. We need a full debate on the issues of family and how parents manage their households and children. We should examine affordable child care provision and ensure parents who opt to stay at home are looked after. Do they do so because they do not have sufficient maternity leave and must jeopardise their work?
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I support the two causes set out by Senator Terry. I would like us to discuss the CSO report early in the new year. This is an important issue regarding opportunity for women in employment and whether the glass ceiling still exists; according to the report it does. It is also an important issue regarding family life, in particular child care.Like Senator Bohan, I am concerned about the increase in toll road charges. The knock-on effect is that residential areas are clogged up and dangerous for residents. This is seriously affecting quality of life in that transport and motorists are moving through residential areas. It would be interesting to have a debate on the issue in the new year.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I also praise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding his decision to re-examine the issue of people with Irish-born children. I hope he extends the proposals to people who have already been deported with or without their Irish-born children.Can the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment be urged to look at the situation regarding work visas for spouses of non-EU nationals who have to come to work in Ireland? The chambers of commerce have stated it is an important issue, and we daily read in the newspapers of the need for more immigrant workers. I am sure the Leader agrees it is also important to keep families together.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I echo my colleagues' comments with regard to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's suggestion about parents of Irish-born children.Senator Henry raised the point I was about to raise. There is considerable concern in workplaces and chambers of commerce about the competitiveness of our economy, particularly with regard to ensuring there are enough workers in the service industry. An obvious solution is to allow spouses of non-EU nationals with work permits to work. There is particular concern with regard to the nursing sector. Many nurses come from the Philippines to do an important job. However, they encounter difficulties in that their husbands and families are not allowed to work in jobs which are available. I urge the Leader to discuss the matter with the Minister.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's remarks on the independent commission on the electoral boundaries for Dáil elections and the fact that legislation has not been introduced to give effect to it. Is the Government stalling its introduction to allow the 2006 census, which undoubtedly will necessitate the making of further changes, to supplant it and push it aside? I would like to hear the Leader's view on that issue.Has the Leader had an update from the Government recently on the future on the Great Southern Hotels Group? There is continuing concern about the future of the hotels as nobody knows whether it is intended to retain them or to sell them off individually or collectively. Perhaps the Leader would be good enough to update the House on the matter?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Will the Leader draw the attention of the Government to the decision yesterday of the Conservative Party in Britain to back the British Government on the introduction of identity cards? We are fighting crime here with one hand tied behind our backs. We are one of the few countries that does not have some form of compulsory identity card. With the support of the Conservatives, the introduction of this proposed measure is likely to become law, although it will take some years to come into being. If we do not take the first steps in this direction, we may well be outflanked, as we were to a certain extent by the Schengen Agreement. Britain refused to sign up to that agreement and, therefore, we were not able to sign up to it. As a consequence we have had to use passports to travel, even to the Continent. I raise this matter because if we delay too long in moving in this direction, we will miss the opportunity and be left out.In regard to the fight against crime, legislation restricting the use of knives has been introduced in Britain. From memory I recall Senator Ó Murchú spoke about the introduction of legislation on knives. We passed such legislation some years ago but perhaps it is not being enforced. I remember at that time meeting a person who planned to go camping and needed to take a knife on the trip but was uncomfortable because he had identified this legislation which restricted the use of knives. I am sure we took people planning such trips into account when the legislation was introduced.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I welcome the call for a debate on this issue of knives. It is important to note that young gardaí who deal with junkies on a daily basis in Dublin do not have the simple provision of a protective vest. Such provision would represent a simple solution to their needs. They find themselves in volatile situations and the provision of a simple protective vest would be a start in dealing with this problem.I am delighted there will be a debate on Northern Ireland. Without going into the political aspects of the issue, I wish to point out that industry has a part to play in regard to such a debate. I will give one example. If one is driving between Carndonagh and Quigley's Point in north Donegal, which as we are all aware is in the Twenty-six Counties, one is welcomed by Vodafone to the United Kingdom. For a Border area, such a sign is sensitive in terms of nationality. Many people find it offensive to be welcomed to the United Kingdom in Donegal. Industry has a part to play in such a debate. Vodafone, in particular, has a part to play. It has had a monopoly for a considerable time which I hope will change under ComReg regulations.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I add my voice to those of a number of Members from the other side of the Chamber, in particular Senators Bohan and Ormonde, who expressed disgust at the raising of the toll charge on the M50 from €1.50 to €1.80. It is important that we realise that the Westlink bridge was put in place many years ago to alleviate the traffic problem, but it is now contributing to it in a major way. It is absurd commuters, cars and other vehicles are being charged by the company in question to use it. While it makes considerable money not only for the State but for individuals, in so doing it also obstructs traffic. This is a complete and utter absurdity. I tabled a motion, which has been seconded by Senator Norris and which I hope Senators Ormonde and Bohan will support, that the Government should take urgent measures to ensure that the Westlink toll bridge is opened, whether that means buying it out——
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	27	It should be nationalised.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I would not mind nationalising it. I have taken on the left many times. It is not very difficult with the Labour Party nowadays.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Hear, hear.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	30	We should note that when this bridge was originally built there were approximately 11,000 cars going through per day. There are now 90,000 per day. It is an absolute absurdity that it is allowed to obstruct the traffic of Dublin. The M50 will now be a double cause of delay because there will be three lanes on it in five years time and there will be a permanent traffic jam when the upgrading begins. It would be sensible, therefore, to reduce that ridiculous charge back to €1.50 and, second, to open the toll gates.
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Could we have a discussion in the near future on escalating electricity charges? I welcome the announcement of grants for alternative energy by the Minister with responsibility for energy. However, I would be concerned if consumers had to pay for those grants down the line. There is concern that while companies benefit from grants, consumers pay for the changes in increased charges.

Will she invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the House to outline her position in advance of any talks at EU level, given that there will be major consequences for towns such as Carlow and Mallow and the south eastern areas that produce beet?
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I did not know Senator Brennan was going to mention it, but I rise to ask the Leader for a debate in the new year on energy and energy resources. Ireland is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world in terms of energy resources. It has very high usage but few resources. We could usefully have a debate on this subject.I ask for a debate on the barbaric custom of female genital mutilation. The matter, on which I have requested a debate on many previous occasions, could be discussed in the context of a general debate on violence against women.I support my colleague, Senator McHugh. On driving from Pettigo to Donegal town I still have to dial 00353 because my phone is still in the United Kingdom. I find that most objectionable.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Recently I mentioned that the parties in Northern Ireland seem to be choreographing events. There has been talk of humiliation. The Taoiseach has gone as far as he can in the effort to achieve a great prize. However, the Taoiseach represents the people of Ireland, as the British Government represents the people of the UK, and there is only so far they can go. I believe the Irish and British Governments have been humiliated in the past week. Two weeks ago I asked where this would end. Something must be done. The two parties must be called together.The increase in the toll charge on the M50 from €1.50 to €1.80 is exorbitant. This toll has increased by 38% in the past two years. Perhaps we should invite the Minister to the House for a debate on stealth taxes. I understood that when we paid tax on our cars, that would be the end of such taxes. However, stealth taxes will be introduced on all new motorways and the charges are exorbitant.

He was prepared to go to great lengths not to put his own standing in the way of making peace.That is an example to all the parties in Northern Ireland and, where relevant, to parties here also.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the citizenship issue, which I understand is before Cabinet today for discussion and, I hope, decision. The issue relates to the parents of Irish children having to leave the country and bring their children with them, or worse, leave the children behind. The Senator asked whether the matter would be decided by legislation or by ministerial order. I presume it will be by ministerial order because the general legislation was to fulfil the requirements of the referendum. Having done that and with the people having voted, it is time for clemency and I believe clemency will be shown. I will investigate the matter for the Senator.Senator Brian Hayes also referred to the legislation in regard to Dáil boundaries. Legislation on boundary changes and the boundary commission recommendations is being drafted at present.Senator O'Toole referred to the Immigration Bill 2004 and to a lively debate in the House on the parentage of children during which the Minister stated he would not be punitive. I listened to the Minister's contribution on the relevant section of the Bill and he was positive on the issue.Senator O'Toole also referred to the student teachers who protested outside Leinster House yesterday and called for the Minister for Education and Science to debate the issue in the House. The student teachers seek an allowance while in training, as others in training might be paid an apprenticeship rate. The Minister is scheduled to come to the House in January or February next.Senator McDowell welcomed the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to the non-national parents of Irish children. He also welcomed the sale of the National Irish Bank to a Danish bank. A report this morning suggested that small firms find it difficult to get decent rates and advantages from banks.Senator Finucane made his points well. He stated that immigrants should be allowed to work. There are over 400 immigrants in Athlone at present. They do not want to walk around aimlessly day after day as they are able-bodied women and men who seek jobs. Plenty of jobs are available for them and I hope they will be enabled to take up job opportunities because they want to work and integrate into the community. These 400 immigrants have lived a long time in imperfect accommodation. I hope that whatever decision is reached in this regard, it will stipulate that immigrants should be eligible to apply for work. Senator Terry raised the same matter in a more comprehensive way. It is a good point to make and I hope such a decision is made.Senator Finucane also referred to e-voting and the verifiable paper audit trail which was the major objection to the system at its previous outing.Senator Norris commended the Taoiseach on his handling of Northern Ireland issues and his telephone call to Dr. Paisley.

One would be damned if this happened because people would say there was no smoke without fire.Senator Bohan referred to the significant increase in toll charges. While many say we must simply put up with this, we should not. It is a Joe Duffy issue if ever there was one. The Minister should not accept the increase. While I am not sure whether the Minister for Transport or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible, I will find out. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.Senator Terry referred to the non-national parents of Irish-born children. Such children do not see their parents going to work as they see their friends' parents going to work, coming home with a wage packet and carrying out other normal family activities. A huge segment of their lives is cut off. As we all know, unemployment which extends to a subsequent generation becomes inbred. The Senator referred to the CSO survey results which are graphically portrayed in The Irish Times today. It states that women are the carers and are the lowest paid. I am not being paranoid about the matter — it is a fact. It would be a good idea for the House to debate the results of the CSO survey.A debate was also sought on child care. A month ago, I gave a commitment to Senator O'Meara to have such a debate early in the new year.Senator Ormonde also sought a debate on the CSO statistics and referred to the Westlink toll charges. She is correct in stating that some drivers are dodging tolls by driving through suburban estates. This leads to an increase of traffic in built up areas and is very dangerous. Talk about rip-off Ireland — Fine Gael should take that one up as a major example.

The point was well made that a worker does not exist as a solitary unit; a worker nearly always has a spouse or partner, and children.

Senator Dooley referred to the same matter, asking for the spouses of non-EU nationals to be allowed to accompany them.Senator Coghlan referred to the 2006 census but if the legislation has been drafted I hope we are going on the last census in which we all had an interest.

Senator Browne sought a debate on the sugar beet industry and wants the Minister for Agriculture and Food to attend the House for that discussion. Senator Lydon sought a debate on energy resources and the issue of female genital mutilation. In fact, Senator Norris raised the latter issue last week in the context of human rights. Senator Lydon also raised the Vodafone issue.Senator Feighan raised the Westlink tolls issue. He also said both Governments had gone as far as they could in the peace process negotiations.

The term "national road" probably means national primary and secondary roads, while the term "motorway" is self-explanatory. Some years ago, however, the law was changed for the classification of roads and there were primary roads, local primary roads, local roads and local tertiary roads. For the Bill to contain references only to local roads and regional roads would be misleading. We should clarify that this means all roads other than national roads and motorways.The Bill also states that "Minister" means Minister for Transport. Previously, all roads came within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. If they were to revert back, would the Minister in question be the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government instead of the Minister for Transport?

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:4.—A person who is driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle (other than one used in the course of the activities of the Garda Síochána or emergency services) and who uses a mobile telephone other than a hands-free telephone shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to like penalties as a person guilty of the offence of driving without due care and attention.This section creates a statutory offence of using a mobile telephone. We are all aware that the former Minister introduced regulations some time ago prohibiting the use of mobile telephones that ran into some difficulty afterwards, not least from the emergency services, who were of the view that their own use of telephones appeared to be prohibited under the regulations. My colleague, Deputy Shortall, proposed a new section in the Dáil to stimulate further debate, although I cannot see the Minister accepting it at this stage.We all see people holding the steering wheel with one hand and a telephone in the other and it is a dangerous way to proceed. I have done it myself but I do not feel good about it. We need to prohibit this and introduce a deterrent by creating a specific statutory offence, not least to clarify the position and place an obligation on the gardaí to implement the law in the way they have been reluctant to do heretofore.

We have all seen so many people doing this. On my way in this morning, I saw three different drivers using a mobile telephone. I do not know what went wrong last time but this is clearly sensible legislation. It must be covered by dangerous driving legislation as well because the person is driving using only one hand. There is a problem and the Minister of State should explain why he cannot accept this and what he intends to do about it in future.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	61	We have all seen people driving with a telephone to their ear and it definitely leads to careless driving.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	62	While I agree in principle with the issue of driving while using a mobile telephone and its effect on driver concentration, I am not sure about the wording of this amendment, particularly the fact that it refers to a hands-free telephone and accepting that is a legitimate operation. There is still a lack of concentration associated with attempting to dial a number on a hands-free set. While I agree with the principle of attempting to prevent people from using their telephones while driving, my reading of that is that it would complicate issues and make it more difficult to convict someone for dangerous driving which is covered in other Acts.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Senator McDowell mentioned that the amendment will not be accepted but that we should debate issue. I agree and I clearly recognise that there is a problem and it needs to be addressed. Senators Quinn and McDowell spoke of the number of people they saw this morning but, equally, Senator Dooley mentioned other areas that were relevant. Simply because a person is not holding a telephone in his or her hand does not mean the problem is solved.However, the issue can be addressed. It was important that this Bill be passed before January even though there were other issues that we would have liked to include which were awaiting clarification. The Attorney General has advised that the 2002 regulations that prohibit the use of hand-held mobile telephones while driving may be ultra vires on the grounds that the regulatory powers of the Road Traffic Act 1961 would not extend to the regulation of such phones. My Department has been considering options for primary legislation on the subject. Legislation would need to be broad-based and adaptable to keep pace with the developments in in-car communication and information technology that is often based on mobile telephone technology and platforms.I am also concerned about research that indicates that a conversation by way of a mobile telephone, with the associated distraction, is much more of a hazard for a driver than holding the telephone. The implications of this research for regulating the use of hand-held mobile telephones by drivers will need careful consideration. Therefore, any legislation dealing with the use of mobile telephones by drivers must be clearly thought out. If its ramifications are not well explored in advance, it might not deal with the real issues and might exclude worthwhile developments that can help to improve road safety. The Department of Transport is working on a broad-based legislation framework for the use of mobile telephones in vehicles. It is hoped to include the results of the work in the next road traffic Bill. Therefore, I ask Senator McDowell to consider withdrawing amendment No. 1. I am satisfied that drivers who use mobile telephones in a way that constitutes careless or dangerous driving are open to prosecution and the imposition of penalty points.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	64	If a driver displays no obvious signs of careless driving — I refer to a driver who does not swerve, have a near miss or hit the kerb, but continues to drive in a straight line under the legal speed limit — is the fact that he or she has a mobile telephone in his or her hand sufficient to sustain an offence?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I would like to ask a similar question. When I became a Senator 12 years ago, I was surprised by the length of time it takes to get something done. We thought that legislation we introduced some years ago addressed these problems, but it transpires that it did not. I accept that the Minister of State has held this new portfolio for a short period of time. I cannot get over the length of time it takes to get things done. Perhaps we try to do too much on occasions. I would have thought that a single section of this Bill would have covered this area of concern. I understand the arguments made about hands-free telephones, etc. What is the difference between talking to a person using a hands-free telephone and talking to another person in the car? Senator Dooley mentioned that problems are often caused when drivers are dialling in such circumstances.The Oireachtas often tries to produce legislation that is tight and involved. It passed a Bill to provide for the muzzling of dogs some years ago after a dog had savaged a child, but it was not enforceable because it was passed too quickly and insufficient attention was paid to its content. I am not a great believer in passing legislation without giving it great attention. I gather that legislation was passed some years ago to deal with the use of knives, an issue that cropped up on the Order Of Business earlier. I can understand why it has been proposed to prohibit the carrying of knives in Britain. We have not been able to enforce the legislation we passed in that regard, however. The Minister of State has said that work is ongoing and that suitable provisions will be contained in the next road traffic Bill, but I do not understand why they were not included on this occasion. A commitment such as that proposed in amendment No. 1 is needed if we are to do something about the carnage on the roads.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It was not possible to include such a provision in this Bill, for reasons to which the Senator alluded. The legislation might not have been enforceable, for example. Further complications might have arisen as a result of changes in information technology. The answer to Senator McDowell's question is that this is a matter for the Garda. When I speak to people on the telephone, they often say they have to hang up because they have spotted a garda who might notice they are using a mobile telephone while driving. I understand that the Garda has successfully prosecuted people for careless and dangerous driving because they have been holding a mobile telephone. It is really a matter for the Garda.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	67	It is not really a matter for the Garda. If we accept that it is, we are saying that it is not a matter for regulations or the law.

I am certain that the Minister of State has often sat for quite a while in traffic that was going nowhere. Is it an offence for one to use one's mobile telephone in such circumstances? I do not think it could reasonably be described as "careless driving", given that one is stuck in traffic that is not moving. It seems to me that it could not be prosecuted as "careless driving" and certainly not as "dangerous driving", unless one does something else that is careless or dangerous.

We need to wait and to give those who are working on the legislative framework an opportunity to present an appropriate Bill. If the Senator speaks to representatives of the Garda, I am sure they will clarify whether the use of a mobile telephone while one is stuck in traffic constitutes "careless driving" or "dangerous driving".

Perhaps the Garda is bringing prosecutions in such cases.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I wish to ask a final question, so that I can get a clear answer. Perhaps I should not bother. Has there been a case of the Garda bringing a prosecution for a breach of the regulations, but not also bringing a prosecution for careless or dangerous driving?
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	76	No. I understand that has not happened.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	77	There has been a significant improvement in the behaviour of drivers since the introduction of the penalty points system. Another problem has developed, however, because drivers have kept within the speed limits, generally speaking, since the inauguration of the system. Lines of traffic often build up on national routes because drivers hug the centre line of the road while driving at 40 mph, leading to long delays and frustration among other drivers. I have discussed the matter with gardaí, who have expressed similar concerns. If the drivers immediately behind the driver who is travelling at 40 mph decide not to overtake, drivers up to six cars back may decide to initiate an overtaking manoeuvre when it is not safe to do so. Not only can accidents happen when such manoeuvres are risked, but they can also take place subsequently when drivers try to make up the time they lost when they were caught in the line of traffic. One can ignore this problem by saying that drivers should travel at 40 mph on national roads.Another consequence of the phenomenon to which I refer was highlighted when I travelled a couple of hundred miles, from Northern Ireland to my home in the south east, approximately ten days ago. I worked out when I had completed the journey that I had travelled at an average speed of 35 mph. The trip of almost 200 miles took me five hours. Those of us who are interested in Ireland's competitiveness should consider that a similar journey could probably be done in two and a half hours in most of the countries with which we compete.It might not be a popular idea, but I wonder if a regulation should be imposed in this regard. Many gardaí who are involved in the regulation of traffic have agreed with me that this matter warrants attention. The main reason for introducing such provisions is road safety. We should recognise that long lines of traffic can lead to frustration, risk-taking and, subsequently, speeding. I assume that slow average speeds on national roads add a substantial latent cost to the economy. The price of almost everything we purchase is affected by transport costs, which I assume are increasing because of this problem.I have tried to think about what can be done in this regard, rather than simply raising the problem. If a driver is travelling at 30 mph or 40 mph — one will have to choose a speed — on a national primary or secondary route and there is a build-up of more than three, four or five vehicles behind his or her car, there should be an onus on him or her to pull in at the first opportunity to let the traffic pass. Where there is a build-up of three, four or five vehicles behind a driver, there is an onus on that driver, although he or she is quite entitled to drive at 40 mph, to pull in at the first opportunity to let the traffic pass.In the past year or two, the NRA has adopted a road safety policy of drawing continuous single and double white lines where there used to be broken white lines that allowed one to pass. This has obviously accentuated the problem. We have hard shoulders on many of our national routes that are not used at all and they should comprise part of the solution. This begs another question concerning the NRA, bearing in mind that we have four-lane carriageways with only two lanes in use and a double line in the centre preventing motorists from passing. The Department should determine whether there is a solution to this problem to ensure that traffic can drive at 60 mph on roads subject to 60 mph speed limits rather than being forced to drive at 40 mph because of bad drivers who are taking up positions at the front and causing significant problems as a consequence. The Department's solution may not be the same as mine but it may be similar.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	78	This is a very important issue and the problem in question must be responsible for a very large number of the accidents. In other countries with single carriageways, there are frequent sections with, say, three lanes, alternating between both sides of the road. There are a couple of examples of this in Ireland, including near Castleisland on the main road to Tralee, and we have some climbing lanes that use this model. If there were such a provision on single-lane carriageways, perhaps every four, five or six kilometres, one would at least be able to overtake. Although the system that obtains in other countries is not within our normal practice and although the Minister may say it would cause confusion, one must realise that our current system is dangerous. Failing the making of every road in the country into a dual carriageway, which nobody expects, some kind of release mechanism is needed.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I have good news on both counts. We must strike a happy balance regarding road safety, as suggested by Senator Jim Walsh. Before I came into the House, I looked up road death statistics for 1996, 1997 and 1998. In 1996 there were 453 road deaths, in 1997 there were 472 and in 1998 there were 458. Speed was a contributory factor in some of these accidents.There have been 359 road deaths to date in 2004 and I am concerned about this. While this figure certainly represents a decrease on the figures for the late 1990s, it represents a slight increase on the figure for 2003. Overall, however, the road safety strategy has been successful in achieving a reduction in the number of road deaths since the 1990s.We do not want people to feel they should be speeding. I am sure Senator Jim Walsh would express this view to those people on the four-lane carriageway he mentioned, who might be travelling at inappropriate speeds while hogging the centre of the road. We can all relate to the Senator's remarks. He will be delighted to note that, when this Bill is passed, it will be a penalty point offence for a person not to give due consideration to other road users. The legislation states a person shall not drive a vehicle in a public place without reasonable consideration for other persons using the place.I very much support Senator McDowell's view on the need for appropriate accommodation. As one who has expressed his views on safety barriers on motorways very clearly, I contend that a safety barrier is more required on the type of road to which the Senator referred than on bigger carriageways with more space. However, I am quite satisfied that we need safety barriers on all such roads. I am particularly pleased to note that a project is under way such that, on roads with three lanes, there will be two dedicated lanes for traffic going in one direction to facilitate passing and one lane for traffic going in the other direction. Both sides will be separated by a safety barrier. After certain set distances, the system will alternate such that the side with only one lane will have two lanes and the side that had two will have one. It is called a two-plus-one road. Such a system is currently under construction on the N20 in Cork. I hope benefits will accrue as a result.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I welcome what the Minister of State has said. We should have more ghost islands on our two-lane national routes. I presume the greatest problem is that there are too many exits off our national routes. We now realise these are causing problems. A number of these exits require ghost islands to allow a car turning in a particular direction to turn safely into a lane provided to allow the car behind to pass on the inside.On the Minister of State's remark about the provision to award penalty points against those driving without due consideration for other motorists, will such people have to be stopped and advised that they have committed an offence? I presume they will and that more evidence than that gleaned from cameras will be required. Those receiving the points should not just receive notification in the post. I welcome the provision because considerable frustration is caused by motorists driving at 30 mph or 40 mph at the front of long queues, thereby holding up the whole shebang. The gardaí would be well employed to pull in those motorists and advise them that they are not the only drivers on the road.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Has the Minister of State had any joy from the NRA regarding the provision of safety barriers? I notice that he has expressed the hope that we will at least be able to commit to putting in place safety barriers within a relatively short period. Can he report on progress in this regard?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Senator Jim Walsh spoke about the frustration — I believe it is road rage — that causes many accidents. I have been impressed by drivers, particularly truck drivers, who pull in to allow one to pass. I approve of the tradition of giving such drivers a little signal to thank them. Manners on the road have improved considerably but there is still great frustration.In the knowledge that I am speaking to a Minister from the north side of Dublin, I contend that there is a bias in respect of the timing of gates at DART stations. I travel south of the Liffey where it seems that I never have to wait more than 90 seconds for the DART gates to open. I have waited for as long as five minutes on the north side of the city. I am sure there is no north-south bias but phenomena such as this cause road rage, frustration and misbehaviour on the part of drivers. I am not sure how to solve the problem but I just wanted to get the issue off my chest.

One may be delayed a little more than is normal because of the work taking place. However, it is good news because it will lead to improved frequency and capacity.

Excusing the pun, it will continue to roll as long as I am in the Department and I will keep it on track.A couple of decisions have been made on safety barriers that the House will welcome, namely, the construction of any motorway will include the appropriate safety barrier. The work being done on the two-in-one roads will include an appropriate safety barrier. We have agreed to retrofit all existing motorways. Two thirds of that work is complete. We are progressing as quickly as possible and the National Roads Authority knows our views on the need to complete the safety barrier project.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	89	This section allows the county manager, as well as allowing a reserved function of the members of the council, to make speed limits temporary. Does it allow the manager to make temporary speed limits on national routes as well as county roads? In making a temporary speed limit the manager must consult the Garda Commissioner. What is the position in regard to emergency situations where, for example, there is an oil spill and the manager may not have the opportunity to get the permission of the Garda Commissioner? Can he go ahead without getting that permission because time could be essential in that situation?
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Yes. The manager will have authority on regional and national roads should it be so required. That is a temporary measure for a maximum period of 12 months.The Garda Síochána handles matters such as oil spills, which may not require a reduction in the speed limit. This normally does not require changing the speed limit for any length of time because it is an acute problem which is dealt with quickly.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Does the Garda Commissioner have power to impose a temporary speed limit?

I met the Assistant Garda Commissioner and the chief superintendent recently on issues concerning the M50 and St. John's Road and other recent incidents. I have asked them to come back to me with a contingency plan to deal with incidents such as oil spills or accidents, which cause traffic disruption. I am waiting to hear from them on that.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I asked a question last week on Second Stage but if the Minister of State responded I was not here and apologise. Is it possible to make special provision for speed limits in bad weather, especially for motorways? It is a standard provision in mainland Europe that the speed limit is lower in those circumstances.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	94	No. The speed limit on motorways or roads is the maximum limit and people are asked to apply appropriate speeds depending on the weather and other conditions that might affect their driving. The Garda does not have power to change the limit. My Department is considering intelligent traffic management systems to have the appropriate mechanism on our modern road network by which we could use an early warning system to advise drivers whether they should slow down, or whether there is an oil spill or accident ahead. These will be beneficial to the driver and help him or her to drive with appropriate care and caution.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	95	What is the position with regard to speed cameras and how is it developing? This section deals with exceeding the speed limit. My French son-in-law was with me last weekend and he could not believe the number of cars that passed us while we stuck to the speed limit. He learned his lesson when the cameras came into Paris and he was caught three times in the first month. He never breaks the speed limit now.If one investment should be made to ensure people adhere to the speed limit it should be the erection of cameras, not only for main roads but cameras that can work at night, the most dangerous time, and on small roads where many accidents occur. We must change people's attitudes because we will never afford to have enough gardaí on duty earning overtime checking drivers. Speed cameras are a good investment. All the evidence shows that reducing road accidents and deaths will make a great saving for the nation.I do not understand why we have not seized this opportunity and I hope the Minister of State is the person who will grasp it and do something about it. Making sure speeding is detected is one sure way of enforcing the speed limit. We need to put in place numerous cameras that work automatically. This is modern technology, it is not impossible. Like hands-free mobile telephone sets in cars this technology works and the investment would repay itself over and over very quickly. Will the Minister of State say why we have not seized this opportunity?This Government and the previous Administration have shown great courage and willingness to tackle difficult and thorny issues regarding road safety. For example, it has been courageous in rolling out penalty points and cameras at times when elections were forthcoming. They were determined to address issues such as the road deaths and casualties we witnessed in the 1990s. We have seen the success of some of our road safety strategies.I totally support the Senator's view on the speed cameras and will be working with my colleagues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform along with my own officials to see how we can continue to roll out speed cameras and the consequent benefits.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I thank the Minister of State for his comments but I do not hear anything like the sense of urgency I would love to hear from him. Investment in road safety measures pays for itself rapidly. The state of Victoria in Australia has set an example in this. While the number of road deaths has come down since the 1990s it is nowhere near the standard it should be. We have the power to do something about this. I would love to hear the Minister of State express much more urgency.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I thank Senator Quinn for his comments but I am being cautious because this is not really within my remit. That issue is not within my Department's remit of responsibility. It is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, I will come back to the Senator with the 2005 programme. Both myself and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, are keen to witness an extension of the existing speed cameras. Perhaps we will establish a working committee between both Departments to achieve progress on the issue by way of agreement. I wholeheartedly support the Senator's view but must be somewhat cautious. I do not wish to give a commitment I cannot deliver. I must work through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I do not understand aspects of this section, which provides for transitional arrangements. Subsection (1) is clear, but I read subsections (2) and (3) several times and am not entirely sure what they mean. If a local authority is slow to replace particular signs, so they still show miles per hour, does that mean the old speed limit still applies rather than the new limit? Alternatively, does it mean that, notwithstanding the authority not having replaced the signs, the new speed limit applies? The provision, as stated, is unclear.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I do not wish to sound too cynical, but it has been 25 years or so since the decision was taken in principle to change signage to metric. We still have not done so in most parts of the country. It will be a logistical nightmare to replace tens of thousands of signs within three days. Assuming we do not succeed in replacing them all, what will be the status of the old signs after 20 January?
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I do not want Members to think there may be a problem. In recent times we have witnessed successfully applied and well thought-out changeovers on a national basis. The commitment of those involved was visible.With regard to this changeover, the 58,000 signs which will be in place after 20 January 2005 have been ordered and received and are now  in situ. They are currently being distributed to each local authority for placement. A programme for the erection of the signs in each authority has been agreed, and a commitment has been given by each manager to the effect that they are satisfied they will be able to meet the target date.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	106	A national primary route, the N4, from Dublin towards Kinnegad has several different speed limits. They range from 30 mph, 40 mph, 50 mph to 60 mph and 70 mph, and change up and down. Under the provisions of this section of the Bill, local authorities must meet to pass by-laws to change speed limits on a national primary route or motorway. I am not sure which is the correct term. The Minister of State has received assurances from county managers, but the county manager has no say. Changing the speed limit in those areas is a reserved function of the local authorities.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	107	We are not changing speed limits, we are only changing signs.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Some of the signs along the N4 vary from 30 mph to 40 mph to 50 mph. The normal motorway speed limit does not apply. The limit fluctuates. Under this legislation, only local authorities will be able to change and implement by-laws within an area. Speed limits already exist, but it will take a meeting of local authorities to change the limits on a national primary route. It is not simply a case of putting up a sign for 50 km/h in place of a sign for 40 mph. I would like clarification on the matter. There is a similar situation on the N7 where the speed limit also fluctuates. Local authorities must meet to pass the relevant by-law.

Section 12(1) states: "On the commencement of section 9, bye-laws made under section 46 ... of the Principal Act continue in force and are deemed to be bye-laws for the purposes of that section 9 and are to be read as applying...”. All we are doing is changing from imperial to metric speed limits.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 15, to delete lines 20 to 28 and substitute the following:"(10) In a prosecution for a fixed charge offence, the relevant notice under this section shall be addressed to that person and shall be given to the person in one of the following ways——(a) by delivering it to the person,(b) by leaving it at the address at which the person ordinarily resides or carries on business,(c) by sending it by post in a pre-paid registered letter addressed to the person at the address at which the person ordinarily resides or carries on business.”.This amendment relates to the delivery of penalty points. Currently, they are posted out to the person who then pays the fine and sends in his or her licence for the attachment of the points. The Government is proposing to contract out the issuing of penalty points and collection of fines.This is a two-pronged amendment. In order to contract out the work without ambiguity, we cannot continue with the current situation whereby notification is posted in the normal manner. It must be sent by registered post. The company that wins the contract must guarantee a system to deliver summons and fines. We would not want the situation we had with clamping, whereby more cars clamped meant more money for the company that won the contract. Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this does not happen with regard to a contract for the delivery of summons and fines relating to penalty points.

Currently if people are caught on camera for speeding they receive a letter in the post and are given a certain number of days to pay the fine or else they receive a summons and are brought to court. However, I know of a case where an individual received no letter in the post.The first indication that person had of having incurred penalty points was on receipt of a summons from the local Garda station. This person could not prove he or she did not receive a letter because such letters are sent by ordinary rather than registered post. There is a loophole in the legislation given that if the system is to be applied fairly, such letters should be registered and that should not only happen when this function is privatised.In regard to the point Senator Paddy Burke raised about this function being tendered out to private individuals, I asked the other day why that should happen. Why can this function not be allocated to a section of the local authority or to a central organisation? Why should private individuals operate a system that could be operated as well and at as low a cost by local government? If that was done, it would prevent the spread of rumours and innuendoes, as the Senator pointed out, to the effect that the more summonses issued for speeding the more money private individuals will receive.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I would be obliged if the Minister of State would talk us through how the process will work. I appreciate that the section refers to contracting out only the administrative part of the function, but I am not clear where such administration will stop and decision making will start. What will happen to the database of information? If we contract out the serving of notices and so on, presumably it will be incumbent on the company, local authority or whoever does this work to maintain the database of the number of people on whom they serve notices. If the fixed penalty is not paid, will that information come back to the contractors or to the Garda Síochána? I presume the information will have to be at least shared with the Garda Síochána.I listened, as I am sure did other Members, to the Comptroller and Auditor General speak at a committee meeting a few weeks ago. His exposé in this regard was remarkable and he was anxious not to place too much of the blame on the Garda Síochána or anybody else but rather to highlight the fact that there were deficiencies in the system.It would be useful for the Minister of State to take us through the system from start to finish, from the point where a person is guilty of doing something which incurs penalty points to the point where if the person does not pay the fixed penalty, he or she will end up in court. What will happen to the information in question and to its storage in that intervening period?

In terms of technology, I am sure there will be a sharing of information, but such administration work will not necessarily have to be based in Garda headquarters.I will deal with the other issues raised. We have dealt, effectively, with amendments Nos. 2 and 3. In respect of the proposals for the delivery of the relevant notice, Senator Paddy Burke's amendment No. 2 provides for the removal of subsection (10) and its replacement by a new subsection that relates to the delivery of a notice in the case of a prosecution for a fixed charge offence.The purpose of section 103(10) of the 1961 Act is to establish two presumptions in regard to any court case that may proceed in respect of a fixed charge offence. These are that in any prosecution it will be presumed until it is proved otherwise that the notice under this section was served and that no fixed charge payment was made. It is a matter for the Garda Síochána to decide how best it should be served rather than tie its hands by proposing only three modes. It is a matter for the force to decide in that regard, once it is satisfied that such a notice has been served.To remove that provision would be to the effect of the Senator's proposed amendment, which would remove the presumption. This would create significant difficulties for the pursuit of any prosecution in that such pursuit can only proceed where the notice has been served and where no payment has been made. It is a matter for the accused to argue against those presumptions if he or she so wishes.The section already provides for the service of the fixed charge notice. Although it is relatively silent on the various methods of service, some of which are referred to in the Senator's proposals, it would not be appropriate to place any limitations on the possible methods of service of such notice. In any event, I do not accept that the removal of the vital provisions in the current subsection (10) to provide for that provision is warranted.In regard to outsourcing this function, I wish to make it clear that there is no link between the number of fixed charge offences detected by the Garda Síochána and the administrative services that it is proposed to outsource to a service provider. In the first instance, there is no requirement on any person to pay a fixed charge. A person accused of a fixed charge offence can allow the matter to proceed to court. The service provider has no influence over the quantity of items that may be presented for processing. In other words, the service provider cannot drum up extra business or compel any individual to avail of the fixed charge administration route in lieu of going to court. It is appropriate to pay for such administration services that arise on a customer demand basis by way of a fee per transaction. This is the most efficient way of paying for such services and provides the best value for money to the Exchequer.Due to the nature of the business involved it is not possible to determine in advance the volumes of payment that will arise. This is dependent on a number of factors, including the number of detections made in the payment rate of such notices. Therefore, any alternative payment arrangement would be extremely difficult to administer. I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I am not confident to withdraw my amendment having heard the Minister of State's clarification. What I propose in my amendment is actual delivery rather than presumed delivery of the relevant notice. That section provides for presumed delivery.The Government proposed to award a contract to person to sit in an office and post out summonses and that person will presume that his or her work is finished at that point. What is put forward is a proposal for inaction. We must be guaranteed that such summonses will be delivered. The Minister of State has not given me any comfort that will be done.The current system, bad and all as it is, is nearly better than what is being proposed. The Minister of State has made no provision to instil confidence that such summonses will be delivered. The format of the delivery of such summonses should be included in the Bill, but there is nothing in what is proposed that gives me comfort in this regard.Members on the far side of the Chamber have referred to cases — we are all familiar with such cases — where such offenders have not been fined or summonsed. This leads to ambiguity in the system. If we are to award contracts for the carrying out of this work and such ambiguity in the system continues to prevail, there will be a breakdown in the system.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Is there a proposal to privatise detection or an element of detection of, say, speeding, given that reports have been circulating for some time to the effect that the operation of speed cameras may be privatised? Could this be considered as part of that campaign? It would be helpful if the Minister clarified that. I understand what is proposed here is the privatisation of the collection of penalties applied to offences that have been detected by a garda on duty.There is concern that the next stage might be the privatisation of the roll-out of speed cameras to a third party and that this, in conjunction with the collection agency, could ultimately lead to a situation similar to the one that arose regarding clamping, as described by Senators Paddy Burke and Wilson. We all recognise the bad taste associated with that, particularly in Dublin. Dublin City Council was cognisant of that when it recently changed the contractor. That is not to suggest that that is the only reason the contractor was changed. Perhaps the Minister of State could outline how he envisages the process leading ultimately to greater detection, if that is the Department's intention.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I want to be as helpful as I can because there seems to be some confusion. The intention is to outsource only the administration. Senator Paddy Burke seems to be of the view that the service provider will be involved in serving summonses and prosecuting. That is not the case. The service provider will be involved only in administering the collection of the fixed charged. It will not be involved in serving summonses. That responsibility will continue to rest with the Garda Síochána and will not be a matter for the service provider.

Eventually, she ended up in court. The position is similar regarding many Garda stations. What of a person who genuinely visits a Garda station on a number of occasions but finds only the green man, which I am not sure will be much help? This may need to be advertised. Will any Garda station suffice? Some make a genuine effort to go to a Garda station but get no response.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Since it has become compulsory for motorists to carry their driving licences at all times, an issue has arisen in regard to the difficulty of carrying a licence on one's person at all time, particularly in rural areas where farmers regularly move from cars to tractors to jeeps. Many farmers are concerned not to lose their licences. While I am not sure this is relevant to the section, as we are dealing with the issue of driving licences, it is worth raising the issue. There should be a capacity to allow for presentation of a licence within a short period. This concern, which relates to rural Ireland and the farming community in particular, has been raised with me and other public representatives. Is legislation or regulation proposed to deal with the matter?

A Kerry man recently telephoned to tell me he could not understand the legislation. Is this measure still in place? It would simplify the process if it were not. There is no need to bring a person from County Kerry to Newcastle West when he could easily visit his local Garda sergeant to produce verification.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	210	With regard to Senator McDowell's earlier question, I mistakenly stated that the penalty for the offence was €3,000. The penalty is €800 for a first offence and €1,500 for a second offence. I confused the offence with not producing a driver's licence, which attracts a €3,000 penalty.In reply to Senator Finucane, one can nominate the station at which one wants to produce the licence. Anybody who is stopped and requested to produce a licence or other documentation that may be required can nominate the Garda station of his or her choosing.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	213	When the Road Traffic Bill 1993 was going through the House, it was introduced by one side of the political spectrum before the Government changed and it was reintroduced by the other side. In both debates, I put down an amendment to the effect that it should not be an offence for a person not to carry his or her driving licence. Despite the Minister of State's point in regard to nominating a Garda station, that was not the point made by Senator Finucane. It is an offence not to carry a licence at all times, even given the back-up option of nominating a station. It is a further offence not to produce the licence some time later.That one did not have one's driving licence while driving through Newcastle West would mean one was already guilty of an offence. I put this to the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, during the debate on the 1993 Bill and stated it was a major difficulty. The then Minister replied he could not imagine we would ever make it an offence for someone not to carry his or her driving licence. However, we have done this and people have been arrested for it.To make matters worse in terms of the issue raised by Senator Dooley, the real problem is that one cannot get a good copy of a driving licence. The raggedy bit of a licence we have does not last any period in one's pocket. I have asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on at least five occasions when he would introduce a credit card-type driving licence. What is the difficulty with this? If this was introduced, we could have a credit card size licence suitable for use in pockets. It is a positive measure which should be introduced immediately. I do not know why it should be delayed.

Recently, I attended an EU Transport Ministers' Council meeting. Ireland is co-operative in agreeing to an appropriate EU driving licence for all member states but other players are not as willing to participate. Some member states issue a driving licence for life, so an elderly driver might end up with a ragged licence bearing his or her communion picture. Such a system can cause complications. Ireland has a ten-year driving licence system and we are prepared to work with our EU counterparts to come up with an appropriate, user-friendly, plastic smart-card system. It would be very beneficial in avoiding fraud.

If a driver is only exceeding the speed limit by three or four miles per hour, a portion of a penalty point or a reduced number of points could apply in addition to the full fine.

I am somewhat concerned, however, that we may try to over use what is an effective deterrent for speeding and other serious motoring offences. The Bill refers to driving without reasonable consideration, which is a subjective term. What may be considered as driving without reasonable consideration for others, might involve an elderly driver making his or her way to or from daily Mass or the shops. It is for the Garda Síochána to decide on such issues but it would be wrong to impose penalties points in all such cases.Concerns were raised earlier in the debate about the privatisation of the penalty points system, which could make it difficult for older people to get about. We should not move too quickly to introduce penalty points for the broadest possible number of cases. People may be driving in a manner which may be termed "without reasonable consideration" but they may just be driving home slowly and carefully.

In page 21, before section 27, to insert the following new section:27.(1) It shall be an offence for a person, without lawful authority, to park in or obstruct a parking space which is designated as a disabled parking space.(2) Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall by regulations, provide a special increased administrative fine in respect of this offence, such sum being not less than €100.".This proposal was made by Deputy Deasy in the Lower House concerning the offence of parking in a space designated as a disabled parking space. In tabling this amendment I support the original proposal. The amendment also seeks to impose a fine for such an offence of not less than €100. Anybody who parks in a space designated for a disabled person is completely out of order and deserves the full rigour of the law to be applied to him or her. The Minister of State should accept the amendment.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	230	In principle, I welcome the idea of greater deterrents for those who park in spaces designated for disabled drivers. In an earlier debate, I raised this matter with the former Minister for Transport. It might be better to impose penalty points for such an offence, rather than the extension to which I referred a few moments ago.It is outrageous for people to continue to use parking spaces designated for use by disabled drivers, some of whom have severe handicaps. It is to their credit that some disabled people can continue to drive despite particularly difficult personal circumstances. The personal use of a car allows them to remain mobile, albeit with great difficulty.They may find, however, that parking spaces designated for their use are being taken by other drivers in shopping centre car parks or on streets. Those parking spaces are thus designated for a good reason, yet some thoughtless, heartless individuals are using them. Such designated parking areas are not just taken up by people who have failed to recognise the disability symbol but by drivers who have made a conscious decision to do so because the space is available. It is an outrageous situation. People who are pulled up for this offence regularly explain that they were only going to park there for a couple of minutes to buy a newspaper or a pint of milk. That excuse is not good enough, however, because one finds that designated parking spaces are continuously filled by such people dropping in for a few minutes here and there. Perhaps this provision needs to be inserted in some other legislation. The Minister of State should consider the matter seriously. It is a significant problem for many people, especially because there is increasingly less parking available in villages, towns and shopping centres. There is no penalty we could put in place that would be considered too mild for those disingenuous people who continue to behave in this manner.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Most urban communities, especially towns, now have designated parking areas for drivers with disabilities. In many cases, a concession is in place that provides free parking for the first hour. Traffic wardens to whom I have spoken consider the fine for illegal use of designated spaces, at €15, is quite restricted. I support an increase in the fine to €100 as a deterrent to those who park in designated areas and cause much inconvenience.

I agree with my colleagues that such behaviour is disgraceful. The fine could never be too high. I would not afford anybody who parks illegally in a designated space the opportunity of getting away with a penalty point. Such people should be prosecuted and, to borrow the phrase of the Fine Gael Members, "named and shamed" in court. That is what they deserve.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	233	As Senator Dooley said, this applies not only to roads and other public places but also outside shopping centres. Recently, I spoke to a young wheelchair user at a Superquinn store located in a shopping centre. She drew my attention to an announcement about a car causing an obstruction in the car park, which had been given repeatedly over the loudspeaker for the previous 20 minutes. She revealed that it was her car and I asked if I could assist her in any way. She reassured me she was fine and explained that she had been about to park in the disabled space when another motorist pulled in ahead of her. She had parked behind that car and informed me there was no problem and she would be out in approximately 30 minutes. Her action was a wonderful way to answer this behaviour.

This Bill may not be the appropriate place in which to include such a provision but the amendment deserves support. It must be extremely frustrating for a disabled person to find that the small number of designated parking spaces have been taken by people who are not disabled. It is a problem that occurs regularly and there must be some provision that will give teeth to the enforcement of the law in this regard.

There is mention in the Bill of careless, thoughtless and dangerous driving. Unauthorised use of disabled parking spaces constitutes undue consideration for the motorists who require those spaces.I require clarification on one issue. If an increased fine or a penalty point is introduced for this behaviour, will such apply to car parks in shopping centres and other facilities? Are these considered public or private spaces? It is in car parks attached to shopping centres that these offences are often committed.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	237	An area of responsibility I am delighted to have relates to the provision of accessible transport, which involves accommodating persons with an impairment or disability of any form. I take this opportunity to ask all parking space providers, whether private operators, local authorities or other service providers, to review their arrangements with regard to the number of spaces available for disabled parking. There is not quite sufficient provision in the context of the number of disabled people who are more active than ever before because of the increased adaptability of vehicles. A number of people have brought to my attention the need to accommodate the motorised scooter, for which I have seen no allocated spaces. This three-wheeled vehicle is increasingly popular.I support the views expressed by all Members regarding the abuse of designated parking spaces for disabled drivers. Accessible transport implies transport for all and that everybody should be able to use the mode of transport they desire. We must ensure this is possible. Such a strategy includes the provision of appropriate parking facilities. The position in regard to illegal parking in a parking space designated for the use of a vehicle carrying a disabled person's permit is that the offence already exists and is laid down in the road traffic regulations of 1997.To answer Senator Morrissey's question, this offence is applicable in public places. In private places, dealing with such behaviour is a matter for the private operator. We have witnessed an increase in the monitoring of private car parks attached to shopping centres, churches and other facilities. A number of private car park operators have put in place a time period to accommodate those who are utilising their facilities. In the greater Dublin area and in other densely populated urban areas, people have been using such facilities to avail of public transport and free car parking. As a result, some parking providers are installing service providers and operators in their car parks to monitor the length of motorists' stay. In some city-centre car parks, motorists can park their cars for no more than four hours and the average time is less than two hours. Clamping and other such provisions have also been provided in some private facilities.With regard to public facilities, there is an on-the-spot fine of €19 for illegal parking. This is the same level of penalty that applies to other illegal parking offences that are detected by gardaí or traffic wardens. The fixed-charge system provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002 is due to be applied to a wide range of traffic offences, including illegal parking, when the Garda's new IT system is operative in 2005 and certain administrative functions have been outsourced to a third party service provider. This roll-out will include the introduction of a new fixed charge for the offence of illegal parking in a disabled persons' parking bay. The level of this fixed charge will be pitched at a relatively high level, at or close to the level referred to in the amendment.I hope my response has been helpful. I reassure Senator Paddy Burke that the sentiment expressed in his amendment, that the fine should be not less than €100, will be taken on board. The level of the fine that can be imposed on a person convicted of this offence was substantially increased in October 2002. A convicted person is liable to a fine not exceeding €800. If the offence is a second or subsequent such offence, the perpetrator is liable to a fine not exceeding €1,500. Moreover, if the offence is a third or subsequent such offence, committed within 12 months of the last, the perpetrator is liable to a fine not in excess of €1,500, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both. The fine levied in any instance is, of course, at the discretion of the court.

In page 21, line 37, after "a" to insert "doctor or nurse who is acting in the course of duty and tending to a medical emergency and also does not apply to a".Doctors should be included in the provisions relating to exemptions for the drivers of emergency vehicles. A doctor exceeding the speed limit in his or her haste to reach the scene of a serious car crash or other accident or to attend a gravely ill person should be exempt from penalty. More recently we have seen doctors' vehicles on call throughout the weekends. They should also be exempt and should be treated in the same way as ambulances, especially in cases where such doctors can prove they are going to attend to an emergency.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I fully support the amendment. On Second Stage I asked whether section 27 gave an exemption to gardaí driving Ministers' cars. I understand that a regulation existed under the original Act. If I drove on a motorway at a speed of in excess of 70 mph and was prosecuted, would I be prosecuted on the basis that by driving in excess of 70 mph I could endanger other road users? Otherwise I should be allowed to drive at 80 mph, 90 mph or 100 mph.We in the Houses of the Oireachtas should show leadership. Ministers can put themselves under undue pressure by taking on many assignments requiring them to drive to various places. As a natural corollary of that one is inclined to speed. In the past when such cars were caught for speeding, publicity always seemed to follow naturally with opinion moulders or people who are respected within the community being the target. The same exemption does not apply to the drivers of the cars of Ministers of State, who are likely to be prosecuted if caught, as happened to the driver of the car of a Minister of State recently.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	246	This section sees the introduction of a new general exemption for the drivers of emergency vehicles from the application of restrictions, requirements and prohibitions imposed under the Road Traffic Acts generally. The Road Traffic Acts and a number of statutory instruments made under those Acts provide the basis for a series of exemptions from certain provisions for the drivers of emergency vehicles. The purpose of this section is to provide for a more general application of exemptions across the broad range of requirements, restrictions and prohibitions imposed under the Acts. The exemptions will not be applicable where the safety of other road users could be compromised. In that context, the exemptions will not apply to the most serious offences given that they have a direct relationship to the safety of road users generally.The services listed in section 27 at present provide the first response to emergencies generally. They are the services directly linked to the emergency incidents telephone service. They also utilise readily recognisable vehicles that are equipped with special lights and sirens. In addition, their personnel are trained in the very challenging skills necessary to drive safely to an emergency while at the same time not compromising the safety of other road users.Against that background it would not be appropriate to extend the scope of the exemptions to individuals driving vehicles that are not readily identifiable to other road users and who have not received the appropriate training to meet the special demands that arise in driving vehicles in response to emergencies. The Senator's proposal is to extend such exemptions to include a doctor or nurse tending to a medical emergency. It would not be appropriate to extend the exemptions to such personnel on the grounds that the private vehicles being driven or used by such personnel would not be readily identified as emergency vehicles by the public and that the drivers would not have the required training.A number of Members will be familiar with the doctor-on-call co-operative system where drivers and readily identifiable cars are provided. In many cases Garda patrol cars will assist doctors and nurses to get to the scene of an accident if required. I hope this might be helpful and I therefore ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.

If my car driven at in excess of 70 mph is determined to constitute a safety hazard to others, surely a ministerial car could also be determined as a safety hazard to other road users. Who determines the safety of the road users? Is it the garda who stops another garda driving a Minister's car, having to make an arbitrary decision? The Government should show leadership. I do not expect it to dramatically affect me in the future.

Fortunately everybody recovered from the accident. The Minister's car was a Volvo and it went up in flames after the accident. Volvo prides itself on the safety of its cars. I am not inferring that the Minister's car was speeding prior to the accident. However, if ever we wanted a lesson in road safety, this case should be taken as a classic example. A Minister driving to attend a meeting or a scheduled appointment should not be regarded as an emergency situation. It is often a question of logistics and arranging one's schedule in order to avoid having to travel at excessive speed.

I support his assertion that all Members of the Oireachtas have a role to play in terms of providing leadership on the issue of road safety and the speed at which vehicles are driven, regardless of whether one is driving such a vehicle or whether one is a passenger therein. It is the desire of the Government and the Taoiseach that those driving ministerial vehicles should adhere to the appropriate road traffic regulations and speed limits.As regards the accident to which the Senator referred, I understand that the car in which the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, was a passenger was being driven within the speed limit. Both the driver and the passengers——

Some ministerial cars are Volvos and, as Senator Finucane stated, the Volvo company has a good safety record. However, there was a degree of ambiguity in the way reference was made to that record. Due to the quick action of the driver on the occasion in question and the safety mechanisms in the car, all passengers got out safely.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The penalty contained in this section is quite harsh. For example, a parent could buy a motorbike for one of his or her children who might be under the age of 16 at the time of purchase and who might use it before his or her birthday without the parent's consent. The parent would then be liable for a fine of €3,000 or a term of imprisonment.In addition, a young person might save money to buy a motorbike for his or her 16th birthday and he or she might purchase it before actually reaching the age of 16. In such circumstances, the person who sold them the motorbike would incur a penalty of €3,000 or face a term of imprisonment. What type of proof must a person selling motorbikes obtain before he or she can proceed to sell them?There are many models of small mopeds available on the market. Many people are not au fait with the fact that the engines in the majority of these are under 50cc and there are some individuals who are of the opinion that they can be ridden on by-roads or side roads without a licence or insurance. People buying or selling these mopeds could incur penalties and fines. In that context, the provisions of the section must be advertised and brought to the attention of parents and the people who sell these bikes.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I am not sure I agree with Senator Paddy Burke on this matter. The section is a response — or at least a partial response — to the provision of so-called "company cars" to young people. This phenomenon has been a real scourge in some communities where unscrupulous dealers or individuals who just happen to possess cars have sometimes given or sold them to under age children who drive them at great speed with no intention other than to eventually crash them. This problem has greatly affected communities in the area of Dublin I represent. It is important to make it an offence to provide children with cars, in the main, in the circumstances to which I refer. I support the insertion of a statutory provision to that effect.I honestly believe, however, that we should go somewhat further. I understand that, under the licensing Acts, if one provides alcohol to under age children or to people one knows are going to pass it on to such children, one is guilty of committing an offence. As well as making it an offence to provide an MPV to someone under 16 years of age, the legislation should be broadened to cover circumstances where the recipient of the vehicle is 18, 19 or 20 years old but where the vehicle is given in the clear knowledge that it will end up in the possession of under age children who will use it in a particular way. In circumstances where the provider knows or ought to have known that a vehicle will come into the possession of someone under 16 years of age, the provider should equally be guilty of an offence.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I agree with preventing under age children from obtaining cars that have reached the end of their lives. There is a group of children upon whom cars that have become mechanically unsafe are being dumped. However, Senator Paddy Burke raised a good point because one can purchase mechanically propelled go-carts and bicycles for children. It is a case of applying definitions.In my view, an adequate definition of the elements of a mechanically propelled vehicle involved is not provided. The definition, as it stands, is too wide and will exclude many products that are on the market and that have probably already been purchased for Christmas. As I understand it, a number of toys which include some form of mechanical propulsion and which are aimed at children in the ten to 15 age group would be excluded.Section 30(3) states that "supply" means supply by way of sale or loan or other means a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person. It is not even a case, therefore, of waiting for such vehicles to be brought on to public roads or into public or private car parks. There is a need for some refinement, which may perhaps be achievable by way of the definition. I am sure the experts will be able to draw up a suitable alternative. Due care must be taken to ensure that we do not destroy what is a good measure in terms of preventing the type of behaviour to which Senator McDowell referred. We must, however, account for a range of products that are already on the market.

I began buying and selling motorbikes when I was in school in order to make some money for myself. However, I do not believe we are discussing such behaviour.As Senator McDowell stated, we are concerned with addressing some of the unacceptable and anti-social activities taking place in some housing estates and parks. As matters stand, children are able to purchase vehicles and do a great deal of damage to property and to themselves. Children are able to obtain money and purchase vehicles either with or without the knowledge of their parents or guardians. We are not presuming that parents approve the purchase of such vehicles.We are trying to address anti-social activities and put in place a framework which will introduce a prohibition on the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to people who should not otherwise have them. As a father, I have purchased vehicles for my two sons, both of whom are minors. I stress, however, that I made the purchases. Provision is made for the purchase of vehicles — perhaps as Christmas presents — if they are to be used off-road by minors with their parents' consent. Should somebody supply a mechanically propelled vehicle illegally, the maximum fine on conviction shall be €3,000.

This would exclude the exercise of clinical judgment by other health professionals such as nurses and a wide range of allied health professionals. That is not the intent of the provision in the Bill. The Bill contains a wider definition, according to which a clinical judgment means "a decision made or an opinion formed in connection with the diagnosis, care or treatment of a patient". That definition is needed for the complaints machinery in Part 9 of the Bill. There is a similar definition in the Ombudsman for Children legislation.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 12, before section 7, to insert the following new section:"7.—Subject to the provisions of this Act and the resources available to the Executive, the primary function of the Executive is to take such steps as are open to it to ensure that each person in the State is facilitated in availing of an individual entitlement to such health services and personal social services as are appropriate to meet the needs of that person.".It is a bit ironic to be discussing the Health Bill when I have the worst bout of ill health I have had all year. We will struggle on. Amendment No. 2 concerns the establishment and functions of the health services executive. When I spoke on Second Stage of this Bill last week, I referred to a matter that has been the subject of much discussion, namely, the absence in the legislation of references to any approach other than a bureaucratic, administrative one. What is really missing is a mission statement for the executive. The executive is to be a very powerful body with a very powerful board, large budget and remit to run the health services of the country. The latter is a large task to assign to any body. The legislation should reflect a very strong patient-centred ethic. The Minister referred to this in her Second Stage speech last week, but it is notable, given the size of the Bill, that the patient does not feature to any great extent therein.The argument can be made that this Bill is about administration, management and bureaucracy. Management and administration are very important and have been the subject of many commentaries and reports that have played a large part in the design and formation of this legislation. However, the Labour Party believes a patient-centred mission statement focusing on the delivery of a high-quality health service for all is certainly lacking. The amendment calls for a rights-based approach to health services. This should be the foundation stone for the executive. The amendment states:"7.—Subject to the provisions of this Act and the resources available to the Executive, the primary function of the Executive is to take such steps as are open to it to ensure that each person in the State is facilitated in availing of an individual entitlement to such health services and personal social services as are appropriate to meet the needs of that person.".This new section, if included in the legislation, would form an essential backdrop to the work of the new executive and would ensure that its work would be driven by the vision outlined therein. Nobody in the House would disagree with that vision. All would agree on the need to ensure that everybody has the health service to which he or she is entitled and which meets his or her needs at any given time, whether he or she is young or old, chronically ill or simply requiring outpatient treatment, or whether he or she has been referred for a fairly simple procedure by his GP or is suffering from a serious illness such as cancer. The ethic of the health service should be driven by this vision and people should be entitled to "such health services and personal social services as are appropriate to meet their needs".This is a very important amendment and I hope the Minister of State will give due consideration to it. I have been reading the Official Report of the Dáil from last week and noted that the Minister did not give the legislation much hop in that House. I hope we are not engaging in a useless exercise in the Seanad. We have allocated three hours to this important debate this afternoon and we are taking Report and Final Stages on Thursday. The Dáil is rising on Thursday. Does that mean that no matter what we say here it cannot go back to the Dáil and be taken on board there? We need to know where we stand. Is this a talking shop or a meaningful exercise?
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I concur with the previous speaker. Fintan O'Toole points out in an article today in The Irish Times that the word “patient” appeared only once in the original Health Bill. I am not sure how many times it has appeared since then. The Government’s lack of consultation with outside groups which have contacted us lately suggests that this Bill is not as patient-focused as it should be. That is why I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Senator O'Meara's amendment is important, as is her comment that the Dáil is rising on Thursday and we are dealing with Report Stage then. Are we just involved in a rubber-stamping exercise today and tomorrow? This is particularly important as there is industrial action in progress in the health boards because of what is regarded as the speed with which the Bill is going through the Houses. The amendment asks whether the health of the individual or of the public is being considered. Public health is very important but I thought the philosophy behind this Bill was the health of the individual and that is why there is a complaints section and redress for individuals who complain. The rights of the patient are not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.Senator O'Meara's amendment centres on this and we should know the Government's views on the rights of individual patients in this Bill, apart from the complaints mechanism. There is no point in having such a mechanism if one has no rights. It is an exercise on paper. The Minister of State should tell us if there is any point in looking at these amendments.

After that it is downhill from my brief perusal of the notes I have before me. I would be pleased to address the points raised by the Senators, for example the question of consultation. The legislation is not being rushed through the Houses without consultation because the Government announced the reform programme 18 months ago and the need and character of this legislation has been well signalled in the intervening period.This amendment is dressed up in the very fashionable language of a rights-based approach but it addresses the issues of eligibility for health services which this Bill does not purport to address. The only way to give flesh and blood to a rights-based approach in the context of the administration of a service as vast as our health and social services is to define the rights in terms of eligibility. To have a rights-based approach it is necessary to translate and specify what the rights mean in the context of a hospital service, general medical and practitioner services and right of access to drugs and social services. The health legislation already provides for all of that. Not alone are there many sections but there are many regulations spelling out in great detail the eligibility of a patient or individual to a particular service. That is a rights-based approach which has been embedded in our legislation since the 1947 Act.That approach to eligibility has been a cornerstone of our health legislation but this Bill is not about that. It is about organisation and management reform within the health system. Senators Henry and Browne noted that the word patient is not often mentioned in this legislation but if one took a referendum of patients in Ireland on whether they agreed with the proposition that we should have nine or ten health boards or a unified national administration one would get a very clear answer from patients about what they wanted.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	291	That is the conviction of the Government and the basis of the thinking in the Prospectus report. The amendment is very well worded and is "subject to the provisions of the Act and to available resources" but there is a danger that were we to enact legislation in that very general sense at this or any point, decisions on treatment would be made in the courts instead of by health and social care professionals. That is one of the difficulties of a rights-based approach when it is based on a lack of specificity about what are the precise rights. When we adopt that approach we transfer powers from this House, and from Ministers accountable to this House, to the courts.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I note that the Minister of State's boss, the Tánaiste Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, made exactly the same point in the Dáil last week about eligibility. I disagree fundamentally with the Minister of State that our amendment is about eligibility. It is not. It is about entitlement. The earlier health legislation which is rendered obsolete by this new Bill contains entitlement provisions. Section 7(1) of the Bill states: "The object of the Executive is to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public." There is no mention of the individual there.We could engage in an argument which says that the public consists of individuals but this legislation removes what exists, namely an entitlement. It is removing a right that individuals have. The Minister of State is correct to say that people have used it in legal battles. There have been legal battles and the courts have decided how people should be treated. I do not agree with that, although the courts play a major role in medical matters which no doubt causes grave anxiety among doctors in particular, and hospitals and other practitioners.I do not know if the Minister of State is correct when he says that were we to conduct a referendum the majority of people would vote to abolish the health boards. The Minister of State says "it is the conviction of the Government" and that is certainly the case. This legislation makes clear that it is the Government's conviction that the health boards are inefficient, do not work or deliver what the Government wants them to deliver. That is fine but in bringing forward this legislation and abolishing the health boards a very important layer has also been abolished, namely, accountability to the person in the street, not just the patient but the person who elects councillors who sat on health boards.This legislation cuts out the community voice of protest about Government decisions on the health service in an area. That is one of its objectives. If there was serious local anxiety about a decision regarding a health service, for example a hospital, the community has had access to the administrative structure which partly drives that decision. The health boards no longer exist, so the community no longer has access. Publicly-elected councillors no longer sit on a body which discusses these issues, so there is no access. The regional forums mentioned in the legislation do not amount to anything more than a talking shop. They cannot do anything. The health service executive, under the clear direction of Minister, will be the board which makes day-to-day decisions about hospitals and services in this country.It is fashionable to write off the concerns of local people. The current Administration will say these are usually politically motivated campaigns involving people like myself. The Minister of State is nodding. He would agree, considering where he is sitting.

We must wait and see. Communities feel strongly about the level of health services available to them. They also quite rightly feel they should have some say and their opinion should be taken into account. This legislation is not about the Hanly report. However, in fairness to Mr. Hanly, he came to a public meeting in Nenagh over a year ago to roll out his proposed reforms. He has not been to any such meetings since. He might have realised it was not a good idea because people turn up and give their opinion. It was a useful forum in order to do so, but will never be available again under this administration.The notion that a community will be heard on a health issue of major concern to it is gone out the window. How people deal with that is another day's work. This legislation is designed to undermine the voicing of local public opinion. It creates an all-powerful, Government-appointed, ministerial-directed board which simply runs the health service against a backdrop of legislation which will have excluded and deleted the notion of individual patient entitlement.

The Minister of State was not here on Second Stage, but I voted in favour of the Bill.I do not want a total denigration of the health boards, because some of them have been responsible for huge initiatives. Senator Feeney said we must get everybody registered with general practitioners as it would remove much chaos from accident and emergency departments. I know from Senator O'Toole that a superior type of person comes from Dingle and Anascaul. The Southern Health Board has registered seriously ill people with chronic conditions with one of seven general practitioners in its area. The board then encouraged the families to do the same. I am sure this could happen around the country. Certain people within the various health boards have started up initiatives to improve the situation. However, I do not think they were given sufficient encouragement by the Department of Health and Children.

The same things were said. The county councils were discontinued as the agents for delivering health services and the boards were established. However, in their 34 years the boards have, in the main, been responsible for the creation and provision of much specialist care in respective regions which would never have been provided otherwise. That is a fact. It is time to look at the situation 34 years later. Several people on the other side of the House, namely, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and other strata of opinion, have advocated the abolition of the boards. It is not true there was no consultation. The chairman of the Midland Health Board met with members and staff of the boards. There is difficulty in terms of coming to grips with change, but we should not fear it. Neither should we be afraid to stand up and say what is good or bad about change. To listen to people on the other side, one would think it was all bad. I do not accept that.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I would have voted for the Bill, although that does not mean I do not have serious reservations about certain aspects. It has the potential to improve the situation, however improvements are also needed in the Bill. It is a mistake, and will require amending legislation within 18 months. Senator O'Meara made a point about a clear mission statement. That is one way in which the Bill is wrong. We need more specificity. It is not clear how it will carry out its business. That is where the difficulty lies. The combination of issues on the objectives and rules and regulations of the plan do not fit. I do not have a problem with dissolving and replacing the health boards, as I have said many times. However, personnel were not the problem. The health boards were independent republics and there was no line of accountability. The Bill contains a provision requiring the executive to get approval for any capital investment it wishes to make. If that was included in legislation covering the health boards some years ago we would have saved ourselves millions, and would have had proper accountability with regard to spending. That was the problem at the time. I could examine and find issues that were good in every health board. However, I could also find issues which were bad.Senator O'Meara has a valid point. The health service executive can give overall thrust and direction. There was often no thread of policy running through the health boards because they were like independent republics. We discussed one example in the House within the last year. For example, in terms of child sexual abuse and reports of such abuse, there was not a common response from the health boards. Health boards considered and approached that issue in different ways. Five years ago some boards did not have any process for dealing with it. The advantage of this system is that we can now have a common national policy which can be delivered locally. That is the plus side of it. However, we could have done something like that within the health board structure if we wanted to do so.The broad model of what is planned in the Bill is good, but it is being rushed through because the Government tied itself into a commencement date of 1 January next. Despite the lovely words of Senator Glynn about members of the Fianna Fáil Party speaking in concert, as a disinterested observer I noted that its members were all over the place on this issue and had different views on it. They were raging about local authority members no longer being allowed to be members of health boards. I hope what the Senator said was right about the broader consultative group.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I hope that it does do the business and it is right that it should be in place. I hold the view, and have said so publicly on many occasions, that locally elected people should have a critical involvement in this structure, but it is wrong to say there was unanimity within the Government parties on this issue. That were not and there still is not.Will the Minister of State agree that because the Government gave a commitment to get this done by this particular date and because of the row about councillors no longer being allowed to be members of health boards, this date suddenly became as important as Christmas Day — it is immovable and we are stuck with it? Consequently, consideration of this legislation is rushed.We should be supportive of the Tánaiste who is new to this job and responsibility in this area, to ensure that the new structure will work, but we are not doing that. The issues in question have not been addressed. The Government has run in fear of even the term "rights-based". There is an importance in giving people a right, but such a right is based on available resources. That would deal with the Government's arguments on this issue and could encompass the point made by Senator O'Meara.We will run into difficulty with the establishment of the health service executive in the manner proposed. It will take over from the boards. It will be able to sue and to be sued, as provided in this section, but will it be able to do the business? There is no indication that it will do so. The legislation does not provide for putting any pressure on it.It is proposed that it will deliver a better service, but how will it do that? We will hand over €10 billion or €11 billion per year to the members of this executive to manage the service. If that was the Minister of State's money or if I was handing it over, I would want a much better receipt than what is given in the Bill. I would want to be sure how such money would be spent. I am not suggesting anything related to fraud or anything like that, but I do not know what efficiencies will be made.For example, in the case of accident and emergency services, will someone tell the members of the executive that we want to reduce the problems in those services, or will we assume they will address those problems? Why are specific provisions requiring the members of the executive to address those issues not inserted in the Bill? In the Bill we ask them to manage and deliver the health service, but that is currently being done by the health boards. What will be different on the establishment of the executive other than that it will manage the health service? That is the problem with the legislation.In deference to what the Minister of State said, I agree with him that the Government cannot cover every situation by inserting another line in a Bill. I am not suggesting that can be done, but we need to know what it is that the members of the executive will be required to do. I appreciate that I have to consider the boarder picture, but will the executive provide better arrangements in terms of bed management or accident and emergency services, or is it required to do that? What rules and regulations will govern it? We can deal with this in more detail when we deal with the proposed plan. I have major reservations about the executive, even though I support the Bill as a broad entity.

It does not specify any targets or benchmarking positions, a point Senator O'Toole effectively made at the end of his contribution. This Bill is not sufficiently patient-focused. Can the Minister of State clarify what targets will apply to the members of the executive? Will this Bill give them carte blanche to do whatever they wish?A major difficulty is the lack of accountability of the executive. Like other quangos that have been established, if a decision is taken that is unpopular, the Minister will wash her hands of it.

We had a debate on the arguments for and against a rights-based approach in the Disability Bill. At that time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said the same as what the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said about this Bill, namely, that much of the money would be taken up in the courts. The Ministers are right. That is where much of it will go.It is bad if legislation is overly prescriptive. I see nothing wrong with amending legislation if we do not get it right initially.I am one of the people to whom Senator O'Toole referred who fought for the right to retain councillors on boards. I believe in the right of local politicians to be on bodies such as this one. The consultative process will work, but we have to give it a chance.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	329	As I outlined in my commentary on the amendment moved by Senator O'Meara, this Bill has nothing to do with eligibility or entitlement under the health legislation. Senator O'Meara made a comment, perhaps it was a stray one, that there was a reduction in rights as a result of this Bill. There is no such reduction in rights. Every entitlement and eligibility that is there for the patient and individual under the health legislation is totally unaffected by this legislation.This legislation is not addressing issues of eligibility and entitlement. There is a commitment in the health strategy to introduce such legislation and the Department is reviewing the legislation to update and rationalise the entitlement framework. However, that framework is covered by previous legislation and it is not being interfered with by this legislation. This legislation is about management structures, it is not about eligibility and entitlement. I want to make that position clear.I agree with Senator O'Meara that local communities are concerned, and have every right to be, about the quality of health services in their communities and they have every right to speak out about them. However, we in the Oireachtas have to look at the history and evolution of our health services. The health service executive is a rational response to the fact that the funding for the provision of our health and public social services comes from the central Exchequer.Prior to the enactment of Health Act in 1970, there was county administration and originally the provision of the health services was funded on the poor law rates that went back to the poor law unions, which I suppose were the original health authorities set up in 1830s and funded exclusively from rates paid by landowners.There was an evolution after the enactment of the 1898 Act. We had county administration, then county health authorities, again with a significant local contribution. In 1970 it was found that the county framework was too small to plan for the rational evolution of the health and social service. Regional administration was established. There was still an element of local contribution involved. There is no element of local contribution involved nowadays, yet Senator O'Meara argues that local administration should have a decisive role in the administration of these services.I agree with Senator O'Toole that there is no accountability in that system. There is unaccountability because a board is set up. The boards did much good work and do not want to take from that. The elected representatives on those boards performed their duties with great diligence. We also legislated in the 1970 Act for the direct representation of some of the professional and allied interests on the board. The result of all this was a body that received a lot of money from the Exchequer and a lot of autonomy. There is more control and more democratic accountability under this Bill than there is under the 1970 structure. That is what is at the kernel of this legislation, and we cannot lose sight of that in our discussion.Senator O'Toole raised the entirely legitimate question of the delivery of services and targets. Under section 10 of this Bill the Minister is given power to do just that and to issue a direction in regard to targets.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	330	That is after the plan is written.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	331	We can return to the issue, but the general directions can be for any purpose relating to this Act or any other enactment or any matter or thing referred to in the Act. The directive power of the Minister is very extensive under section 10. That is as it should be because the Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas is exercising the taxing power of raising the funds that fund the service.I agree with Senator O'Meara that there must be local consultation, and that is also provided for in this legislation. However, the legislation reflects the principle that he who pays the piper calls the tune. That is something those who advocate more local government must address. If they are not prepared to pay for a service at a local level, they are not really entitled to an exclusive say in running it at local level. It is that historical fact of life that has given rise to this legislation, along with the major changes that have taken place in Ireland since 1970.I agree with all of the Senators who praised the work of the health boards. Many have taken wonderful initiatives. Nobody is taking from that. However, in terms of communications, our country is far more integrated now than it was in 1970 and the speed of communications, the speed of movement between different parts of the country, the technological revolution which has affected medical science as much as any other branch of learning, all point towards the need for a national authority. That is what we are legislating for in this Bill.I am aware I am revisiting Second Stage but to some extent the discussion so far has tended in that direction and I wanted to reply. It is our strong conviction as a Government that this legislation is very much in the interests of the patient. It is in the interests of the patient that we put an efficient management structure in place.Senators make the point that local views must be heard and entertained. I do not disagree with that. However, I reject another suggestion, canvassed by Senator O'Meara, that this is part of an agenda to downgrade a particular hospital or to lessen the capacity of a community in any part of Ireland to champion the need for proper services in its hospital. That is not the case. The Bill has nothing to do with that issue. It has to do with providing the best service for the patient. That is the objective, along with getting value for money from the very substantial investment made in health administration. They are very laudable objectives. I do not accept that the Bill is being introduced to in some way affect the rights of persons in local hospitals.To come back to the central point I made already in this context, he who pays the piper calls the tune. If there are difficulties with the provision of services in local hospitals, it is to do with the allocation of resources. In other cases the difficulties in local hospitals and smaller hospitals have not concerned resources but the recognition of professional qualifications — the observance of professional standards, the maintenance of sufficient numerical levels of staff, and the existence of a sufficient number of patients to justify the provision of a particular service. Those difficulties also exist. However, all these matters can be judged fairly only in the context of who is providing the funds. To interpose a local health board between the fund provider and the service does not add to the debate. Choices must be made in this area and at least the Minister is prepared to come forward and make himself or herself responsible for those choices but needs, given the vast amount of expenditure involved, a technical, well-equipped body to supervise implementation.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I know we have spent a lot of time on these amendments. I thank the Minister for his Second Stage approach. His setting out of where the Government is coming from on this issue has been very useful. It is not news to hear him setting that out. However, he has been clear and open and I commend him on that approach.We would take a different approach. We live in a democracy and we are entitled to take different approaches. As an aside, like other Senators on this side of the House, I have had representations from Senator Glynn's party colleagues regarding the abolition of the health boards with which they were not happy. I am sure he is aware of that.I have no difficulty with reform. I accept that times have changed and we must be cognisant of whether the structures we have in place are the most effective for the delivery of the best possible service for people who need it. That must be our ultimate aim. Everybody would agree with that. The question is how we go about it.The structure the Minister is setting out in this legislation is over-centralised and cuts out any sense of local involvement, consultation, accountability — call it what one will. The Minister may say that the health board structure did not work. As many people have said, health boards delivered excellent services, often on their own initiative and in response to need as they saw it. However, there was inconsistency between health boards on a whole range of issues, including, as Senator O'Toole mentioned, child abuse.Is it necessary in reforming that structure and creating an integrated service — and as the Minister says, he who pays the piper calls the tune — to completely abolish democratic accountability and create such a centralised structure that people on the ground have nowhere to go, because I do not accept that the regional forums are anything other than talking shops? I am not saying that local councillors will not air what people have to say, but that is all that will happen. They will air what people have to say. It will very likely be reported in the local paper and that is as far as it will go because, ultimately, the board will make decisions at the Minister's direction.The amendment under discussion is at the core of our fundamental problem with this legislation. The Minister spoke in general and vague terms about the possibility of the Government coming forward with legislation which will have the issue of entitlement at its heart. It sounds vague. It may or may not happen. We know this Government has something of an allergic reaction to anything with a rights-based approach, so I would not hold out much hope on that front.We have had a very useful discussion on this amendment on the principles and vision of this board and also on the issue of entitlement. I do not intend to take it any further.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 12, subsection (4) (b), line 37, after “training” to insert “(which education and training shall, in the case of medical professionals, be provided by postgraduate professional training bodies)”.The part of the Bill dealing with the objects and functions of the executive with regard to the training and education of students, nurses and other health professionals is interesting, and I am interested to hear Senator Henry's view on it. If I read it correctly, the Bill gives the executive extraordinary power when it states at subsection (4):The Executive shall manage and shall deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services in accordance with this Act and shall. . . .(b) to the extent practicable and necessary. . . facilitate the education and training of—(i) students training to be registered medical practitioners, nurses or other health professionals, [I take this to mean doctors and nurses] and(ii) its employees".The executive will be responsible for the delivery of health services and all else to do with the training and education of nurses and doctors. This is a new way of operating. The amendment seeks to insert the wording, "(which education and training shall, in the case of medical professionals, be provided by postgraduate professional training bodies)", which is the case at present. I am interested to hear the Minister's response.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I am also interested to hear it. The Minister may be aware of the considerable concern among the postgraduate training bodies as to what exactly this means. The board could have significant power over what facilities will be available for training. Professional competence is increasingly important in all parts of the health service, and I am not just talking about medical or nursing students at undergraduate level but also at postgraduate level where we want professional competence maintained. This section seems to allow the board significant power over the training bodies, which have done a good job and worked extraordinarily hard in recent years to make sure that medical professionals received proper training within, for example, hospitals, general practices and the public health service. It appears they will all be subordinate to this board, which has caused considerable concern.

Is this related to the area of competence assurance for the professions, as the Department is now talking about funding this?
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The issue must revolve around the meaning of the word "facilitate". If I were to take a benign interpretation of this, it would be to the effect that the board would be required to co-operate with the postgraduate institutions which require their students, such as house doctors etc., to have experience at ground level. A situation often arises among all sorts of professional groups, from psychologists to teachers and others, whereby they cannot get the experience they require because others are too busy to make space available to trainees.If "facilitate" means that facilities will be made available, this is positive. However, if it means encroachment in any way on those who deliver the service at present, it would be appalling and probably in breach of other legislation which goes back many decades. We need clarification on this.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Most Members spoke to the section rather than the amendment. The key word is "facilitate". The executive is obliged to facilitate the education and training of students and the employees of service providers. We are considering the well-established practice of the in-service training in institutions which will be managed by the health service executive of persons training not alone to be doctors but also to be medical and paramedical professionals. That is the intention of this subsection. In a more positive sense, I assure the House that the Minster does not entertain the interpretation that this is any attempt, whether overt, covert or otherwise, to exercise control through the executive over the proper independence and autonomy which the many professional and educational organisations concerned enjoy.The amendment would have the effect of confining the facilitation referred to in the section to that provided by postgraduate professional training bodies. That would be highly restrictive. It would, for example, curtail opportunities for health professionals to receive training and education in a range of other fields apart from their professional clinical field. The obligation in this regard is to facilitate training of a wide range of staff, including medical professionals. It is an obligation that must be imposed on any health service executive in regard to the health services sector.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I am delighted with the Minister's response. Nobody is better placed to interpret what the services need than the staff delivering them. For example, a training hospital may be short of nurses or doctors. Given that the health service executive will be responsible for the delivery of services in such institutions, it would be up to it, and under legislation it is obliged, to involve itself in the initiative of providing the training for the relevant professionals sought by any relevant institution. All should welcome this, as I do. I welcome the Minister's comments in regard to the established postgraduate training institutions, namely, that they still have a positive and proactive role to play.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	340	There is a serious problem in regard to continuing medical education.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	341	As the Senator is aware, a significant amount has been invested by the Minister and the Department in the development of higher education in recent years, especially on the nursing side. However, funding is always a matter of individual negotiation in the appropriate context. For example, with regard to in-service training, the question of remuneration and funding becomes a matter between the health service executive and its appropriate corporate pup, which manages this particular activity, and the body with which they are dealing.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Therefore, it will be in charge of the funding for postgraduate education.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The Minister is not clear on this.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	345	In a recent debate on other legislation, the shortages of speech therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists and a range of specialists were highlighted and it was obvious that something needed to be urgently done. Will the new executive have some role in this? For example, despite a recent advertisement in the national media for a radiologist, nobody applied for the position.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	346	It is happening everywhere.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	347	It is. I understand there are only approximately 100 radiologists in the country, with some having come from abroad. The situation is unsatisfactory. In the view of many, it is a necessity to deal urgently with this. They look to the executive to make some inroads into the shortages of speech therapists, occupational therapists, radiologists and other specialists that cause difficulties and annoyance for many.If we are going to put a new health service executive in place, we must have some indication that it will be in a position to deal with that most unsatisfactory situation.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I think we have given this matter a good airing. I call Senator Feeney.

Will it cover protected study time for junior doctors? Many of the problems arise because young doctors do not have protected time for study purposes. When they are meant to be studying they are equipped with a bleeper which could go off at any time summoning young doctors back to their posts. Will the provision cover that type of matter because it is very important?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I am glad Senator Feeney raised the issue of protected time. Given that the Department of Health and Children will now be solely in charge of policy, it seems that this service board will have extensive control over postgraduate training, with regard both to finance and time.

If one has a unified health executive examining the issues, the possibility of devising an integrated approach to this problem is far greater than under the present arrangement with a multiplicity of health authorities. There is no doubt, therefore, that a single authority will identify far more quickly than at present where are the gaps and bottlenecks in professional qualifications, and how they can be addressed.We are digressing from the section, however. I am not saying that the section gives the executive direct power to deal with that but there is no doubt that its establishment will make the executive an indirect influence in securing that objective.

While I know they are in the same section, they are different in content. Perhaps I will come to understand it over time. For purposes of clarification, in page 12, subsection (4), line 40, after the word "providers", my amendment No. 4 seeks to insert the following wording: "as provided by the ERHA and health agencies prior to January 1st 2005."
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	356	With all due respect to the Minister of State, his replies are unclear. I thought the matter was clear at the beginning but it is becoming more confused. That is the case with regard to the issue of what facilitation means and the points that were raised about the shortage of therapists. I have said before that there is a shortage of doctors. From examining what has happened, we know that the majority of people placed in medical schools in Ireland are women. We also know that the average period those women graduates spend in practice is five to seven years, although I do not have the figures in front of me. In many cases they do not continue. I am only making that as a statement of statistical fact. I am not presenting this in any kind of sexist fashion. We know the numbers who return to medical practice as specialists later. Could the health service executive demand an increased intake into the medical colleges to ensure that in ten years time additional doctors will be available?Fianna Fáil speakers referred to the lack of therapists but there is currently a shortage of every kind of therapist in this country. In addition, there are all sorts of practices concerning what qualifications are recognised. Twenty years ago, a European directive required the mutual recognition of third level professional qualifications in the EU member states, yet we have got nowhere with it. People who may be fully qualified in certain countries are not recognised as such here. Will the health service executive be able to insist that a new school of pharmacy should be established? I take that as an example because we are aware of the mess we got into previously with the Department of Education and Science arguing with two different third level institutions about where such a school might be situated.Can the health service executive take initiatives? When the Minister of State answered the question the first time, it seemed he was saying that the executive's involvement would only be to pay whatever aspect of the cost relates to the in-service, in-house, in situ, institutional training of these professionals. As the debate has continued, however, the Minister of State seems to be saying that the executive will have some control or influence over the delivering institutions. What is the situation? Will the executive have an input into the numbers of people who will qualify?

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	359	This would solve the Minister for Education and Science's problem about points, if more people could get in. In addition, while more women opt to study medicine we do not know if any men are applying. I have been trying everywhere to find that out but I do not think male students are applying to study medicine in the same numbers as women students are. I would be most grateful if the Minister of State could find out that information and let me know.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Senators Daly and O'Toole have raised an important point concerning therapists. This matter was raised some time ago by the Joint Committee on Education and Science. Surely the health service executive will be able to set target figures or even introduce a lesser degree course in some of the regional colleges to help out in the interim. The points system is so high that when those people qualify they can demand jobs in other areas. Something must be done because we are fighting a losing battle. The new health service executive should have some control over this matter. Remedial steps are required to provide such services in the short term.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	361	We have travelled a long way from simply exploring the meaning of the word "facilitate", which was the point of departure for this particular discussion.

It highlights a point, which is an important one, that the executive will be engaged in national workforce planning. As a result of that planning exercise, the executive will identify where there are difficulties, including gaps in provision. To answer Senator O'Toole's question, the executive cannot establish a school of pharmacy. These are matters for the Minister for Education and Science, and ultimately for the Government.

In page 12, subsection (4), line 40, after "providers" to insert the following:"as provided by the ERHA and health agencies prior to January 1st 2005".
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Amendment No. 4 seeks to freeze practices in the context of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. That is a rigid requirement to impose in the legislation. It would unnecessarily curtail the obligations on the executive to deal simply with education as it is frozen today in current or contemporary practice on 1 January 2005.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Amendments Nos. 5, 35, 44, 45 and 48 form a composite proposal and may be discussed together by agreement.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 13, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new subsection:"(9) In the performance of its functions the Executive shall co-operate and co-ordinate with the voluntary and community sector where it is involved in activities similar or ancillary to the remit of the Executive.".This is a self-explanatory amendment. It serves to acknowledge the positive role played by the many groups involved in the voluntary and community sector. It is important that the new health authority should recognise that contribution and take it on board in formulating decisions. The prospects in this regard are not encouraging, however, given that the Government has not consulted widely enough and has rushed the legislation through the Dáil and is attempting to do the same in this House. The voluntary and community groups are annoyed by this approach. It does not augur well for the future.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I support Senator Browne in his amendment and in the sentiments he has expressed. I do not accept there has been widespread consultation in the formulation of this Bill. It only became obvious to a number of groups quite late in the day the extent to which they will now find themselves in an entirely different scenario to that they have previously experienced. Despite all that has been said about the health boards, they did afford the voluntary and community sector a seat at the table.I spoke on Second Stage about the Government's embracing of the voluntary and community sector through its recognition of the sector as a fundamental pillar in the community in the context of the National Economic and Social Forum and the partnership agreements which have been the cornerstone of our economic prosperity over the past number of years. Therefore, it was surprising to see that this legislation did not afford sufficient recognition to the important role of the voluntary and community sector. This represents a contradiction of the Government's own policy and position in regard to the function of the sector. This is a worrying development and it is unsurprising that we have had approaches from a number of groups which are concerned at the new departure that the Bill represents.During the Dáil debate on Report Stage, there was extensive discussion about this issue, which focused on the area of disability. There seems to be an attitude enshrined in this legislation that workers in the disability sector, represented by the Disability Federation of Ireland, are seen as service providers. This is the role they will be accorded under the new framework. I am not sure this goes far enough in recognising the role of such workers in the community. They are far more than service providers. I am concerned that the legislation, in its overweening bureaucratic approach, simply sees bodies providing a service and having an almost commercial relationship with the new executive. This neglects the extraordinary role played by such people in our community.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I am sure voluntary and community groups have been in contact with the Minister of State to communicate their disappointment at not being involved in a more formal way in the formulation of the Bill. Senator O'Meara put it well when she observed that workers in this sector are not just service providers. In particular, they are advocates for the various groups with which they deal. There is a perception that they will not be at the table and in a position to continue the advocacy they have undertaken so effectively in the past.People in the sector were greatly cheered by the praise they were given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, at the end of his Budget Statement. This indicated that their worth was recognised. However, they have been disappointed in their hope to make their voices heard through having an input to amendments to the Bill in regard to the important functions of the board and its various sub-committees.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The voluntary and community sector is not ignored in this Bill. Section 7(5)(a) stipulates that in performing its functions, the executive must have regard to, “services provided by voluntary and other bodies that are similar or ancillary to the services the executive is authorised to provide.” I appreciate the point made by Senators that this relates to service provision in its terms. However, the executive must have regard to these services. That specific statutory recognition is important in the legislation.Section 7(5)(c) requires the executive to have regard to, “the policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister of the Government to the extent that those policies and objectives may affect or relate to the functions of the executive.” In a sense, therefore, the reference to voluntary and other bodies is put ahead of that relating to the policies and objectives of the Government in regard to the performance of the functions of the executive. The health strategy recognises that co-operation between statutory and voluntary providers facilitates a more responsive approach to meeting needs. This is what is envisaged in the legislation. The Government supports and promotes the voluntary and community sector, as evidenced in this provision.The executive is required to use its resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner. In endeavouring to do this, it will have to consult with all sectors, including the voluntary and community sector, providing services similar to its own, in an attempt to co-ordinate its work with that of other bodies. This will ensure that the best quality service is provided to the public. The Government is committed to this partnership approach in the health strategy. There is no dispute about this.Senator Browne's amendment No. 35 proposes that the service plan prepared by the executive must, "have regard to the role played by the community and voluntary sector in the development and provision of health services." Again, this proposal is already encompassed in the provisions of section 7(5)(a).In preparing the service plan and arriving at a plan which outlines the services it plans to deliver, the executive must consider the services provided by other sectors, including the community and voluntary sector. This allows it to take account of the concerns of other sectors and arrive at arrangements with service providers in those sectors. The final service plan will serve to optimise the services the executive can deliver to the public in any one year. I agree with Senator Henry regarding the importance of advocacy. However, advocacy is recognised as a service in itself and can be funded as part of a service plan.Senator Browne's amendment No. 44 proposes that, in establishing the national health consultative forum, the Minister, "will have regard to the role played by the community and voluntary sector in the development and provision of health services when considering the remit and composition of the Forum". It is inappropriate to oblige the Minister to consider any one sector when appointing members to the forum. I have no doubt the Minister will look carefully at many of the very qualified individuals in the voluntary and community sector when she comes to make her appointments. However, this is not a matter that can be tied down in legislation.Amendment No. 45 seeks to oblige the executive to consult with, "local communities, the community and voluntary healthcare and personal social services sectorand other groups about health and personal social services". As I have said, the legislation already provides that the executive must have regard to services provided by voluntary and other bodies. Provisions for consultation are included in Part 8 which deals with public representation and user participation. This applies also to amendment No. 48. The issues raised by Senator Browne's amendments are covered in the legislation.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	376	All the Minister of State's references to the legislation point to services provided by the voluntary and community sector. It is clear that the framework set out in the Bill for the relationship between the executive and that sector is purely in the context of services delivered. I have listened carefully to the Minister of State's response and every point has included reference to services provided. This is clearly the relationship the legislation defines between the executive and the voluntary and community sector. In that regard the amendments tabled by Senator Browne are amendments proposed specifically by the Disability Federation of Ireland, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware. They do not in any way interfere with, alter or undermine what the executive sets out to achieve. However, they ensure the unique role of the voluntary and community sector as an equal partner in the health services, not only in the delivery of the health services but in the initiatives taken particularly in representing its own groups. This legislation does not recognise it as an equal partner in that regard as these amendments seek to do. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider them positively.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Consultative machinery is of course established in the legislation. In addition I reiterate the point I have already made. Services in this context often encompass advocacy. The Department funds a number of organisations in respect of their advocacy services. There is circularity in the conversation the Senator and I are having about this subject. Clearly the anxiety of Senators is that the voices of these organisations should be heard. However, in certain cases the Department of Health and Children through the relevant authorities pays for the voice of such organisations to be heard. This legislation is being introduced in the context of that practice. In this context the word "service" has a very wide meaning and is much wider than the provision of a particular service to a particular person.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	378	Our earlier discussion was focused on this section. This section on the object and functions of the executive and the one dealing with the plan are the two that give me the greatest cause for concern. I do not get comfort from this section as a good receipt for our €10 billion or €11 billion. We need to know more. What is the deal here? Earlier the Minister of State referred to efficient management. Senator Feeney talked about the importance of consultation. Has anyone noticed that three major trade unions have declared war on the executive before it even starts because of lack of consultation?This is supposed to represent good management. How can I have confidence in this structure if even before it starts it seems to have got things wrong? I am told that the contract, which exists between every GP and his or her local health authority, is not automatically transferable to the new HSE. Every contract will need to be renegotiated. The Minister of State understands contract law better than anyone in the House. As the GPs' existing contracts are not automatically transferable to the HSE a major renegotiation and consultation will be required, which has not even started. We are two weeks away from D-day on this matter. I cannot have confidence in it.While I will not rehearse the difficulties in appointing a chief executive, that person in the main will be charged with the delivery of the objectives. While I do not blame the Government for the problems that arise in this matter, a chief executive designate should have been appointed before starting this arrangement. The failure to make such an appointment does not instil confidence.Section 7 is exceptionally vague. Even accepting the point made by the Minister of State that it is not possible to legislate for every issue that might arise, the Bill contains phrases such as the following:The object of the Executive is to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.While I agree with all that, what does it mean? What is different about that from what the health boards are supposed to do at the moment? Why will I get better value for money having it written in this legislation than I got when it was written into previous legislation? More pressure should have been applied, but was not.We should have spelled out what we want here. Reducing the problems with accident and emergency departments, having more efficient bed management and ensuring the availability of the appropriate number of therapists and specialists in various areas should have been set out as clear objectives. While this would not take from what we require, at least I could say that I knew the areas on which we would spend €10 billion or €11 billion each year. If they were not achieved we would know the executive was not delivering. What will change and where we will get better value for our money and a better service? While that may be a somewhat rhetorical question, it is not rhetorical to ask for section 7 to require the executive to deliver those requirements.It is implied that we will get a better framework for the staff. There is responsibility towards employees. There is the question of having a better health service for patients. However, how will it happen? What will be different? Where will it start? If we had picked one of the health boards and eliminated the others and had asked it to run the whole country rather than one area, the authority would be centralised, which is one of the main objectives of the legislation. However, nothing would be done differently. I see certain improvements in accountability and ministerial influence, which should always have existed. As discussed, other matters are not included. I cannot see us being in a better position after enactment of this legislation.The Bill will open the doors to private medicine here. That does not reflect any philosophical position, but is a statement of fact as I see it. While the Government may want to do so I do not see this as a recipe for improvement. Does the Bill address new contracts for consultants or the arrangements for medical personnel at all levels? No requirements are made of them to do specific tasks. While we need not tell them how to go about their business, we need to outline the requirements. I would love to require the executive in its plan to produce a set of objectives with a timeline. Section 7 should outline the objectives we want reflected in the plan. As Senator O'Meara said earlier, it is about having a mission statement in another way with clearly defined objectives. The new health service executive should be required to produce a plan outlining what it will do against each objective and a timeline for each against which we can judge its effectiveness. Otherwise how will we measure it?I know the Minister of State can point to section 10, which provides that the Minister can do this, which is fine. However, why should the legislation not specify it? This is fundamental enabling legislation. It is not housekeeping, scheduling or something we make up from time to time. This is about having a service available and making certain demands.The point was made earlier about the lack of specialists in certain areas. In my view it would be better to do that. Why is the Department of Education and Science responsible for medical schools? The fact that it is responsible for education is not a good enough reason. Responsibility for those schools and delivery of medical education should be rooted in the health service.I look forward to the Minister of State's reply but there are so many things missing from the section, which is vague, that it is difficult to have confidence in it as a way of obtaining recompense for the hard-earned €10 billion we have paid out in taxes.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	379	It is worth noting that the health budget, at €11 billion, accounts for almost 25% of all expenditure. It is huge and members of the public need to know that their money is being well spent. There is grave uncertainty about the Government's handling — one could say it is mishandling — of this issue. At present, there is an interim chief executive in place. Section 7(8) states, "the Executive has all powers necessary or expedient for it to perform its functions." In my view, which the Tánaiste does not share, the decision by the person initially appointed to be the chief executive officer not to take up the post indicates that he believed he would not have the necessary powers to allow him to do his job. The Government faces difficulties in that regard.The Minister of State used the analogy that he who pays the piper calls the tune. When the tune is out of key, who will take responsibility? Will the blame be placed on the CEO who, in turn, will blame someone else or will the Minister or the Government accept responsibility?

In my opinion the functions of the health service executive are set out in such vague terms in the section in order to give the board, the CEO and the Minister carte blanche. In other words, anything, everything and nothing can be done. As regards our discussion on an earlier amendment, the definitions section does not define what is meant by a “service”. A definition is supplied in respect of what constitutes a service provider but not a service.

Will the Minister of State clarify what will be the position from 1 January on foot of the grave uncertainty that exists?

The replacement has been done by what lawyers term "novation", whereby a new party stands in the shoes of a previous party. Under the legislation, the health service executive will stand in the shoes of the relevant health board. There is no question about the termination of contracts. That does not arise.

That is a well-established feature of the employment law landscape. It is certainly a feature of the landscape being dealt with in this legislation. I refer the Senator to section 63——
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	398	There is nothing in that section which relates to normal contract law under which two people have a contract with each other.

However, it makes a reappearance under section 63. The issue he raised is, therefore, addressed by the section which provides for the continuation of contracts.The Senator correctly raised a more fundamental point about how we are going to obtain better value for money, how we are going to get the desired return on our investment and how section 7 is drafted in such a vague way. I admire Senator O'Toole's enthusiasm. I hope he sustains that enthusiasm and interest. Up to now, he has not been a member of a health board and has not, therefore, been in a position to judge of these matters.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	401	On the enactment of the legislation, however, he will, in effect, be a member of a health board because the Houses of the Oireachtas will have functions in respect of the health service executive and the Minister. Committees of the Houses will, as appropriate, be able to summon officers to appear before them in order to question them about matters. Senator O'Toole will note that the provisions relating to accountability provide for the service plan and the annual report. The latter must be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas.I accept that section 7, as is common in any statutory provision or in the objects clause of a limited liability company, is drafted in broad terms. However, it is appropriate to have such a provision in this Bill because we must set out, in general terms, what will be the objective of the executive. It is important that these terms should be as general as possible because if they were too specific, the health service executive might exceed or go beyond the scope of its proper powers and functions.In such circumstances, therefore, the Parliamentary Counsel has provided for wide objectives for the executive in order that it might, in effect, do anything it desires in respect of the services. The section states that the executive is "to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public". Nobody in the House could disagree with that objective. Equally, however, no lawyer could say that objective does not cover a wide range of functions and powers. That is the purpose of section 7, namely, to give the executive maximum power to deal with what it is being established to deal with.Senator O'Toole raised a fair question — I do not dispute its validity — about accountability, which is provided for in section 7. The section provides for an executive that will prepare and submit corporate plans to the Minister, for publication of the implementation of the plans, for serviced plans, for amendment of plans and for accountability to these Houses.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 13, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following new subsection:"(2) Notwithstanding the terms of any agreement under subsection (1), the Executive and the public authority shall, when requested, provide all information to the Minister in order to enable him or her to furnish a full reply to a parliamentary question.”.This relates more to the other House but makes an important point about getting a reply to a parliamentary question. We may not know much about parliamentary questions officially but I have seen Deputies submit questions to the Minister for Health and Children and receive a standard reply that the question has been referred to the health board that will in turn furnish a reply in the near future. It can take months for a reply to arrive. Invariably, some people have forgotten the initial query.There is a major problem accessing data in the health boards at the moment. I hope the new health service executive will look at the ICT systems when it takes over because that would speed up answers to parliamentary questions and might avoid disasters such as the granting of medical cards to those over 70, where the Department completely underestimated the impact this would have and the number of people in the country who were eligible. Will the Minister of State give an assurance that when Deputies ask questions, they will get proper and prompt replies? I urge him to do whatever he can in the Department to ensure the health service executive has the IT resources to make the information readily accessible to the people being asked the question. It is in everyone's interests that this amendment be accepted.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The old health boards had five members from each local authority within the health board area who could ask questions of the chief executive officer of the health board. That has been removed by the Minister. This amendment, therefore, should be accepted. A situation similar to that regarding a nursing home last week cannot arise again. People must get answers if they require them and it is only right that provision should be made for parliamentary questions.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	405	This is like when someone asks questions of the National Roads Authority and never gets a reply because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government always says it is a matter for the NRA and that he does not have a function in the matter.We should also look at the accountability of the executive to the Oireachtas through the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. It is obvious that the committee does not have the resources necessary to ensure a body spending €11 billion a year is fully accountable. For the Minister of State to suggest that the board will be held accountable in this way is ridiculous. Unless the legislation contains a statutory provision that the committee would be given the resources it needs to ensure the board is held accountable, it is meaningless. That is regrettable because this is so important. One could think of a range of functions of the executive that a health committee would have to examine. It must also examine the role of the Minister. It is unrealistic to suggest that the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children could hold the executive and its chief executive accountable in the spending of such a large budget.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	406	These are important amendments. I assume Adjournment debates in the Seanad are equated with parliamentary questions. It is extraordinarily difficult to get information. Almost a year ago, I asked the Minister for Health and Children in an Adjournment debate if he could tell me how many people with mental illness or intellectual incapacity for which there was no suitable treatment or institution here were being sent outside the country for treatment. The Minister said he could not tell me but he would ask the health boards to get in touch with me. Despite having sent a reminder after six months, I have had replies from only three of the health boards to date, almost a year later.

It was necessary to correspond with 11 different health authorities to elicit this information which the Minister, regrettably, has not been able to obtain for the Senator to date.The amendments reflect a discussion that took place in the other House and the Minister responded in section 79 of the Bill, which empowers the Minister to make regulations, including regulations relating to the supply by the executive of specified documents or information to Members of either House, and correspondence by the executive with those Members on such other matters as the Minister might consider appropriate. It is important to notice that the terms of the section provide for Members of either House of the Oireachtas to receive information. A parliamentary question can only be tabled in the other House and the Minister has tabled an enabling provision which allows the Minister to draw up regulations providing for the supply of information to Members of either House. It is modelled on the section that was adopted at the time of the abolition of the dual mandate for local government.

The amendment was introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil in response to the amendments that have been reproduced today. I cannot see how Senator Browne's amendments will add anything to the Bill.There is a technical point that parliamentary questions are not a subject for legislation; they are a matter for the other House in its own Standing Orders but I do not see the advantage of imposing a legal requirement on the executive to provide a Minister with information. Of course, the executive must be directly accountable for its decisions and the Government must obtain that information. Section 79 enables the Minister to make those regulations. Section 10 allows the Minister to issue directions to the executive that can include a direction about information. There is sufficient power in the legislation to deal with the Senator's concerns.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	411	What the Minister of State said is still unclear.

It is not for me to judge. I understand that the legislation will not change the practice that exists in the other House. If a question is asked about a matter pertaining to a health board, for example, the information sought is not given by the Minister and the Deputy is referred to the health board instead. This legislation will not make a difference to the parliamentary practice relating to parliamentary questions. At present, if one asks a question about a matter that is exclusively within the province of a health board, the ministerial reply refers one back to the health board. After this Bill has been enacted, the ministerial reply will refer one back to the health service executive. The only change is that the Minister has introduced regulations which allow the executive to provide information to both Houses of the Oireachtas.

The Tánaiste has been due to visit the joint committee twice since she was appointed as Minister for Health and Children, but she has cancelled on both occasions, because of a genuine illness and because she had to take the Health Bill 2004 in the Dáil. That proves that it can be difficult to get people to appear before a committee.The Tánaiste's comments in the Dáil last week do not inspire confidence. On Committee Stage in the Dáil, she accepted a Fine Gael amendment relating to the accountability of the HSE to the Oireachtas, but she overturned that on Report Stage. She was challenged to give certain assurances by the Labour Party on Report Stage in the Dáil last week. The amendment tabled by the Tánaiste gives the CEO of the HSE the option of not attending the committee, but sending somebody else instead. In response, the Tánaiste said that "the CEO will not nominate any old flunkey to come before an Oireachtas committee" and that "we do not have flunkeys working in the health service".

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	420	Having listened to the Minister of State, I assume there will not be any change from the existing practice. Deputies who submit parliamentary questions on health issues are often told in response that the Minister has no involvement in the matter and that it should be taken up with the health board. We know what they get then. There is a fundamental difference between the existing arrangements and the new arrangements. Under the existing arrangements, at least 14 or 15 public representatives sit on the regional health boards.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	421	That is true.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	422	No such avenue will be open to the public under the new arrangements. Deputies, Senators and councillors used to be able to refer people who approached them to members of the health boards who, as public representatives, were not afraid to ask questions. Under the proposed arrangements, however, nobody will know the members of the executive. That will be a substantial change. Senator Browne's amendment is reasonable because the public will demand answers. There is an onus on the Government and the Members of the Oireachtas, as legislators, to put in place a system under which people will be able to get answers. According to the Minister of State's comments this evening, however, no such avenue will be open to those who are looking for answers. Many charades along the lines of the nursing homes charade that was exposed last week, which could cost the taxpayer €100 million, will develop as the years go by. It behoves the Minister of State to accept the amendment, or an amended form thereof, in order to open an avenue to allow the public to get answers.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	423	That avenue is opened, for the reasons I outlined, in section 8 of the Bill, which enables the Minister to provide by regulation for the furnishing of information by the authority directly to Deputies and Senators. The Minister will get additional powers in that respect. The issue of whether the Minister will have to answer the questions he or she is asked will be a matter for the Chair, as it has always been. The Minister will have the power to compel the authority to provide whatever information he or she wants. All of that is provided for in this legislation. The essentials of accountability in the Houses of the Oireachtas are fully protected in the Bill as it stands. The amendments before the House will not add to the legislation.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	424	As far as I can see, amendment No. 6 proposes to amend the wrong section. If Senator Browne had wished to strengthen the rules governing the replies to parliamentary questions, he should have proposed to amend section 79. People want to know about the new arrangements under this section. Will there be agreements between the executive and the public bodies? This section deals with the new arrangements between the executive and the public bodies. For example, what arrangements will be made with harbour authorities? That is something that baffles me. There may be a need to provide information about the agreements and arrangements which will be put in place. Will they involve public expense? I am not sure the amendment will clarify the matter. I would like to know whether what Senator Browne wants to achieve can be achieved under a different section from that he has proposed to amend. His amendment relates to agreements between the health executive and public bodies.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Will the Minister of State clarify whether the Minister considered that if the health service executive was not dealing effectively with a regional or local issue he or she would have the power to give directions to the executive to deal with it?

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	430	In connection with comments made by Senator O'Toole and the Minister of State's reply, section 10(2) provides that, "the Minister may issue specific written directions to the Executive...[looking for] any information or statistics relating to the performance of the Executive's functions". That should work both ways. The Government should also lead. One of the fundamental flaws in the Bill is that the Government has not set out clear targets.I do not expect the Minister of State to reply to this because the matter has already been discussed but while the Minister can also request statistics from the executive, there is an onus on the Government to have clear targets on what it would regard as minimum service. For example, I know two ladies in Carlow who will not be able to see a consultant in Beaumont Hospital until next September. They must wait ten months, which is surely unacceptable. I have also encountered a problem lately where the family of a gentleman involved in a serious car crash has been told that he must wait three to six months to get into the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire. That is also unacceptable.There is an onus on the Government to set clear targets. Clear targets are at least something for which to aim but if there is nothing for which to aim and the Government blames every problem on the health service executive we fail in our role as parliamentarians.

I draw the Senator's attention also to section 32 which provides that after approving a service plan the Minister may direct the executive to submit an amended service plan and may specify in the direction the manner in which the plan is to be amended. Those are very specific powers of amendment vested in the Minister which is not qualified by the word "general".

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 15, subsection (1)(a), line 21, after “appointed” to insert “or elected in accordance with regulations made”.Section 11 refers to the membership and role of the board. This group of amendments refers to several issues in that connection which I will set out. Amendment No. 9 concerns elections, amendment No. 10 proposes that the chief executive officer should not be part of the board, amendment No. 11 proposes "Election of members of the Board shall include election by panels of professional and staff interests". Amendment No. 12 is not mine, amendment No. 13 deals with conflict of interest and amendment No. 14 deals with gender balance.The legislation does at least refer to gender balance but our amendment goes somewhat further than the vague aspirations contained in the Bill and makes it specific, which is necessary in light of our experience of appointments to State boards.The Minister of State will agree it is necessary to be specific rather than having a general aspiration if one is to achieve gender balance.Senator O'Toole referred to the legislation as quite vague with regard to those appointed to the board. There will be 11 members appointed by the Minister in accordance with section 11, among them the chief executive. There is a case to be made for the chief executive not being a member of the board. This pertains in many cases. The role of the board is the creation of policy and the implementation of policy is the role of the chief executive. I would go either way, but it is worth looking into.I would like the Minister of State to explain the rationale behind the chief executive being a member of the board. He or she will be a very powerful individual, not only controlling the board and budget of €11 billion but also having an extraordinarily demanding role in overseeing administration of health services and all it demands and requires.The board is an important panel and will play a significant role. We do not know who will be on the board, although we know who is on the interim board. As Senator Browne pointed out, there is quite a banking influence. What is the Minister of State's vision with regard to the function of the board? It will be too late for us to do anything when the board is appointed, but it will give us an indication. However, I ask the Minister of State to be nice to us since it is Christmas. Perhaps he could give us some indication whether the final board will reflect the make up of the interim board or whether it will reflect a different set of interests. One would expect the big interests in the health sector to be represented, for example, consultants, doctors, nurses and health service workers. Will the voluntary and community sector be represented? Will the board be dominated by bankers or economists, people whose bottom line relates to the figures on the page?Nobody would argue with the importance and necessity of value of money, efficiency in how it is spent and the elimination, as far as possible, of waste in health service spending. I have been raising a fundamental point since the start of this debate at 3 p.m. today. The mission statement has not been set out in this legislation. In its absence, one wonders how the board will see itself functioning. Can the Minister of State say what the board will look like?The election of board members is not provided for in the legislation. I ask the Minister of State to consider its inclusion. Senator Browne supplied me with an article by Fintan O'Toole which recently appeared in The Irish Times. In it he refers to an earlier document written in advance of the appointment of the health service executive. It states the Department of Health and Children published a consultants’ report on the process of establishing the HSE. The report stated the HSE would have the confidence of the stakeholders, workers, GPs, etc. Clearly that is not the case at this time.One way to ensure it happens is set out in amendment No. 11 which states "Election of members of the Board shall include election by panels of professional and staff interests". The issue of election of members to the board should not be ruled out at this stage. The process would include whole sectors which would form part of it. Ministers have talked of a consultation process. What better process than a democratic process of electing members to the board? Not all must be elected. That would entail too large a body of work. However, what prevents professional and staff interests electing members? Such a measure could do nothing but good, and would in no way undermine the functioning of the board.

It asks that details of each person's suitability and expertise be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. European Commissioners recently had to endure intense scrutiny. All state appointments in America go before either the House of Representatives or the Senate, and proposed appointees are placed under immense pressure to explain themselves. I am not advocating such measures, but each person should have his or her details placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas so we can scrutinise them.Unfortunately, the need arises because of the debacle surrounding the Irish Blood Transfusion Board in Cork where there was difficulty regarding political appointments to the board. The end result was that many people resigned, the board broke up and there was chaos. Apart from the anguish of board members, the ordinary public also suffered. This amendment seeks to avoid such a scenario. It is normal for there to be tension on any board. However, we want to avoid a situation whereby people are appointed purely for political reasons without the necessary expertise to be of benefit to the board or the public. Eleven people will be in charge of a budget of €11 billion. That is a lot of money and it is vital those selected carry out their work and make an input that will be of benefit to all.

The medical profession is disappointed there is no specific provision to appoint one or more members of the profession, particularly since the Department of Health and Children made such an issue of getting consultants involved in clinical and general management. The Irish Nurses Organisation is also disappointed because there were specific seats reserved for it on the boards and this is a big change.Senator O'Meara's amendment regarding gender balance is preferable to everybody doing the best they can. Considering how things are progressing with regard to the HSE, a few people with expertise in human resources might be the most important requirement.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	438	There are a number of amendments and I will deal with each of them. Senator O'Meara invited me to speculate on membership of the board. It is a matter for the Minister under the legislation, but there will be an element of continuity with the interim board. However, the final decision rests with the Minister.Amendment No. 9 seeks to allow elections to take place for the appointment of members to the board of the executive. The intent of the amendment is that some members of the board could be appointed by means of elections conducted in accordance with regulations drawn up by the Minister. Appointment of members to the board by means of these elections would be an addition to the provision currently in the Bill which allows members to be appointed by the Minister.As the Tánaiste said in her Second Stage speech, the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the creation of a unified management structure under a management board. It is not intended that the board be representative, as would be the case if the amendment was accepted. The board will comprise competent, experienced persons drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. The representation of the stakeholders in the system can be dealt with through the national consultative forum, local public representatives and the advisory panel.Amendment No. 10 seeks to delete a provision of the Bill which provides that the chief executive officer shall be an ex officio member of the board. Senator O’Meara asked me to outline why that was the case. The CEO is a cornerstone of the system being set up and will be an Accounting Officer for public accounts purposes before Dáil Éireann. His or her position as a member of the board is a matter of common sense. It would be advantageous to the board, but not to a board which has a Chinese wall between it and its chief executive officer. It brings the board in line with modern corporate governance, practice and principles. The CEO can bring a particular dimension and perspective to the board given his or her familiarity with operational matters and issues arising for the board that will help it in making decisions.Amendment No. 11 provides that the elections proposed by the previous amendment shall include elections by panels of professional and staff interests. This would be a cumbersome method of appointing the board. I am not satisfied that electing board members on this basis would achieve the range and mix of skills, expertise and competence required for a broadly based board. However, the amendment is useful because it serves to throw into relief what exactly the board will do. Senators asked how the board will operate after the establishment date.It is important to bear in mind that the HSE board will be a management rather than a representation board. By accepting this amendment there is a risk that the board will be seen as representational or sectoral in its make-up. The Prospectus report addressed this issue of appointments to the board. It concluded that with over 300 grades of staff in health care, it would be impossible to have a representative system based on professions which would be workable. It is also pointed out that professional representatives tend to examine issues from the perspective of their own profession rather than that of the broader community. For that reason it was decided to set up a management board, appointed by the Minister.Senator Browne moved an amendment proposing the laying of information about the suitability and expertise of an appointee before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I do not consider that appropriate. Under the provisions of section 11(5) the name of the person appointed to the board is published by way of a notice in Iris Oifigiúil and this is sufficient.The purpose of amendment No. 13, which relates to financial interests, is to disqualify a person, who is perceived as having a conflict of interest by reason of a substantial financial connection with a commercial interest, from membership of the board of the executive. The Bill contains several safeguards to ensure the proper functioning of the executive's board as well as the maintenance of standards of integrity and conduct and the implementation of the code of governance. That is set out in a different part of the Bill. The intent of this amendment is covered by section 25 under which board members and senior management are subject to the Standards of Public Office Act 2001. Section 17 of that Act in particular deals with the issue of conflicts of interest or material conflicts of interest. That is dealt in that Act, the general legislation covering persons in this position in regard to State boards and positions.Section 25 of this Bill provides that a code of conduct will be drawn up for employees and advisers who will not be covered by the Standards in Public Office Act. This code will be admissible in any proceedings brought before a court or other tribunal. This legislation together with the ethics in public office legislation and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 plugs any of those ethical gaps.Amendment No. 14, moved by Senator O'Meara and supported by Senator Henry, sought to designate 40% of the membership of the board, as a minimum, as men and 40%, as a minimum, as women. It is not appropriate to put a numerical number on the gender balance of the board. The provision is the Bill is the standard one in Bills of this nature which obliges the Government to take into account the need to secure equality.In amendment No. 17 Senator Browne proposes that the Minister should be obliged to notify the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children of any alteration to the composition of the board made under this section. The Minister is required to insert a notice in Iris Oifigiúil advising of the membership of the board or of any alteration to the board under the provisions of Schedule 2 which deals with the filling of casual vacancies on the board.

We have a fair idea of that. He said there will be continuity and the new board will consist of quite a number of the current membership of the interim board.The new board will be a management rather than a representational board. Is the view of the Minister of State and his Department that a board cannot be both? Could a person representing a professional or staff interest not have a background or an ability in management, or is it the view that management people must have a background in banking, economics or business? We are beginning to see what the new board will look like.In regard to the CEO being an ex officio member of the board, the board is to be the governing body. Is there not a case to be made for the board having a supervisory role in regard to the CEO, or is that not the case? The board does not have a supervisory role in regard to the CEO.

If, however, the CEO is part of the board, that could dilute or even undermine that possibility. If a function of the board is to supervise the CEO and that is the way it should be, how best does one carry that out? It would be better carried out if the CEO was not a member of the board and the board had its own dynamic and way of doing things.In regard to the general balance of the board, I am not surprised by what the Minister said about the standard section. We can note what the standard section is producing or not producing. This vague objective is not achieving gender balance to which the Government states it aspires. Provision in this regard needs a more specific section. The amendment speaks for itself.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 16, after line 42, to insert the following new subsections:"(3) A member who does not attend a meeting of the Board shall within three days of non-attendance, submit to the Minister in writing, the reasons for that non-attendance.(4) A member shall cease to hold office if the Minister is satisfied that due to absence, a member cannot continue to discharge their duty.".One word that is absent from this section, if the House will excuse the pun, is "absence". The Bill specifies, somewhat vaguely at times, that the Minister may at any time remove any appointed member from office under certain conditions. It does not refer to cases were a member regularly fails to attend board meetings. My amendment provides that a member who cannot attend should notify the Minister within three days of the reason he or she was unable to attend. It also provides that the member shall cease to hold office if the Minister is satisfied that due to absence, the member cannot continue to discharge his or her duty.I am not sure how often the board will meet. However, there are only 11 people deciding a huge budget. Ideally they should not miss any meetings, although that happens from time to time. They need to be fully up to date and briefed on what is happening. If members are not attending meetings, bad decisions could be made and the public would suffer as a result. The issue of absence of board members should be addressed. I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I regret I cannot accept the amendment, though I accept the motivation behind it. I do not consider it necessary that a member of the board should be required to inform the Minister of the reasons for his or her non-attendance at a board meeting. The members appointed to the board will be persons who have a responsible attitude to their role. There may be occasions where an unexpected event occurs and a board member will be unable to attend a meeting. I do not believe the member should be required to write a note to the Minister to explain his or her absence. The quorum for a board meeting has been set at five. We consider this to be the minimum number of members necessary to have a meeting.Subsection (1)(a) of section 13 enables the Minister to remove an appointed member of the board if he or she is of the opinion that the member has become incapable, because of ill health, of satisfactorily fulfilling the role to which he or she was appointed. In addition, section 13(3) stipulates that a member of the board who fails to attend a meeting of the executive for six months ceases to hold office unless the member can satisfy the Minister that the failure to attend was due to illness. These are protections written into the legislation which address in part the concerns raised by Senator Browne.

The Minister mentioned that the quorum is set at five. If an important decision is voted on by all 11 members present at a meeting and there are six for and five against, it would be hard to stomach but people would accept it. If six members were absent and only five voted on an issue and the outcome was three versus two, there would be public outrage if it was a decision that could have a significant impact in a different part of the country.The danger is that absenteeism could result in very unusual and improper decisions. If the full board is present the issues will be properly debated and, perhaps, voted on. Although the example I give is an extreme one, it would not be satisfactory if only the bare minimum of the board were to make important decisions. That would be a disaster and would make a mockery of the whole set up.Regarding absence, the Minister referred to the six-month rule. Can he clarify how many meetings a member would miss in a six-month period?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The board must meet at least 11 times a year. The board also has power to lay down rules and regulations regarding presence and absence. It is normal on any body to have such rules. In all corporate practice there is a fundamental distinction between a person missing a meeting and being absent and a person being excused for non-attendance. I do not believe the amendment reflects that fact.Regarding the more fundamental point on the quorum, I could postulate contingencies which might appeal to the Senators where they would be very glad that the quorum is fixed at five. For example, if the health service executive was anxious to make further provision for what is already an excellent Caredoc service in Carlow or provide an extension of the services at Nenagh Hospital, and was advised by the chief executive that an urgent decision was required and it was impossible to assemble more than five members of the board to make this decision, I am certain the Senators would welcome the fact that the quorum was fixed at five. A quorum is a basic legal requirement. It is a minimum, not a maximum. It is envisaged that the board will work as a board with the collective wisdom and intelligence of its members. To legislate for a universal attendance at every meeting is not something we as sensible legislators should do.

I do not expect there would be full attendance at every board meeting. For an urgent decision it might not be possible to have everyone in attendance, and an attendance of five would be fine in that case. However, on a vital or very important issue, where a cutback in an area is being announced, it is vital for everyone concerned to have as near to a full board attendance as possible.In the case of a member being absent who wishes to have his or her vote recorded on an issue, for example, a member who is in hospital, is there any facility for proxy voting?

In page 21, line 6, after "1998" to insert "and provision shall be made to ensure that a detailed breakdown of the estimates of expenditure are available for scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann".This amendment relates to the chief executive being the Accounting Officer. The Minister referred to this in the context of an earlier amendment. The amendment is self-explanatory. Its purpose is to ensure that a detailed breakdown of the estimates of expenditure are available for scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts. The Minister said already that the CEO is accountable and must come before the committee. However, this amendment is an important clarifying measure and would ensure full transparency and accountability. It would also be a great support not only to members of the Committee of Public Accounts but to all Members of both Houses to have that detail available.

I contacted the Comptroller and Auditor General's office on the matter. Is it the case that a Minister cannot be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts but that it can call the Secretary General of a Department?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	463	As Senator Browne indicated, it is the practice to call the Accounting Officer before the relevant committee, not the Minister. In the administration of any Department an Accounting Officer can disagree with a Minister and can refuse to sanction a payment which the Minister requests. That is the nature of the safeguard inserted in our public accounting system so that a Minister of the day can request a particular payment be made or sanction be sought for particular expenditure. The Accounting Officer can simply refuse this and tell the Minister that he or she is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to a matter and cannot sanction the expenditure. This is a well established feature of our constitutional system.The amendment tabled by Senator O'Meara raises the interesting question of the new position of the chief executive as an Accounting Officer. The point is that the health service executive will now have its own Vote in the Estimates volume. The accountability structure for a body with its own Vote is already set out in other legislation beginning with the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866-1998, the annual Appropriation Acts and the rules and procedures of the Committee of Public Accounts.Section 20 makes the chief executive officer the Accounting Officer for the appropriation accounts for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation. The chief executive officer is, therefore, required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in his or her role as Accounting Officer. The title "Accounting Officer" is defined in the Comptroller and Auditor General Act 1993 as the officer referred to in the 1866 legislation to whom the duty of preparing the appropriation accounts of a Department is assigned. Appropriation accounts are accounts for the money voted by the Dáil for the supply of services.The role of the Accounting Officer is central to the system of accountability for public money. It is part of a long established system dating back to reforms introduced in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. It is designed to ensure an open and transparent system for scrutinising the manner in which funds are used, having regard to the principles of regularity and propriety and, in more recent times, the criterion of value for money.The key element in the accountability framework is the Committee of Public Accounts. This committee undertakes the scrutiny of public funds and reports to Dáil Éireann. This scrutiny by the committee is based on audits and examinations carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Accounting Officer is personally responsible for the regularity and propriety of the transactions in the accounts for which he or she is answerable, the control of the assets held by the Department or, in this case, the executive, the economy and efficiency in the use of the resources and the systems, practices and procedures used to evaluate the effectiveness of its operations.The concentration of responsibility in one individual differs from arrangements in the private commercial sector where responsibility normally rests with the board. The Accounting Officer system is unusual in that while being accountable as Secretary General to the Minister for managing his or her Department and for other duties, the Accounting Officer is personally answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to regularity, propriety and value for money. The Accounting Officer appears before that committee in his or her own right, not as the representative of the Minister.In the case of the health service executive, the relationship between a Secretary General and Minister would be replicated by the relationship between a chief executive officer and the board of the executive. While the board can instruct the chief executive officer as to what to do in regard to particular matters of policy, with regard to regularity of financial matters the chief executive officer will have a unique statutory responsibility which will be supervised by the Committee of Public Accounts.

In page 21, lines 41 to 44, to delete subsection (9).The section is extraordinary and unprecedented. Subsection (9) states: "In carrying out duties under this section, the chief executive officer shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy."

The subsection is located in a general section dealing with the attendance of the chief executive officer before Oireachtas committees. It is in that context that the subsection is enacted. Senators will notice that subsection (9) begins with the words: "In carrying out duties under this section." It is not an attempt to prohibit or censor the chief executive in any way but to delineate the position of the chief executive officer when he or she appears before an Oireachtas committee.If one were to accept the amendment and delete the provision, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children would be free to ask the chief executive officer about matters of policy and his or her agreement or disagreement with it, and he or she would be obliged to answer. Matters of policy are properly the domain of Ministers and the Government. It would not be appropriate for a representative of the executive to comment on policy matters. To ask a chief executive officer such a question would compromise his or her ability to properly serve the elected Government of the day and would also compromise the ability of the Government to have a working relationship with the chief executive officer, who has a pivotal role under this legislation in the planning and execution of policy in regard to health matters. This type of provision is standard in legislation setting up commercial semi-State bodies.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	479	This Bill addresses the need to make statutory provision to allow housing and planning authorities to register as a charge a claw-back against individual properties provided by them under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value. It is specifically required in the context of the entry into the affordable housing mortgage market of private lending institutions which will provide competition and consumer choice in this area. Additionally, it will facilitate the direct sale of affordable units by a developer or builder to eligible persons nominated by the housing or planning authority. This will speed up the sale of the unit and make the administration of the affordable schemes more efficient and cost-effective.Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented demand for housing brought about by a number of economic and demographic changes, including rising disposable incomes, historically low interest rates and changing household formation patterns. These factors continue to place significant pressure on housing demand and house prices. The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability and access to affordable housing, particularly for first time buyers. This will help to bring moderation to house price increases.The Government's approach to meeting housing needs is clearly working. Our success is evidenced by our outstanding house completions record. The year 2003 was the ninth record year for house completions, with 68,629 units completed, an increase in output of over 19% on 2002 and an increase of 10.5% in output in the greater Dublin area during the same period. This year is likely to be another record year. The latest figures indicate that more than 60,000 units were built in the first ten months of the year. We are building at a rate approaching 19 units per 1,000 population, an outstanding achievement. Increasing the supply of serviced land through targeted initiatives and the commitment of Exchequer funding has also been effective. There is a five year supply of serviced residential land nationally and sufficient land to meet the needs of Dublin for some eight years.While the rate of house price increase remains problematic, it has moderated considerably since the late 1990s when price increases peaked at 40% in 1998. A number of market commentators, including the Central Bank, have predicted a greater balance in the housing market over the next few years, as increasing supply will have a dampening effect on house prices. Affordability has also been assisted by a range of factors, including high levels of economic growth which have facilitated lower tax levels and increased disposable income, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates and low inflation.Indicative data available to my Department show that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market. This is supported by the CSO quarterly national household survey for the third quarter of 2003 which indicates that almost 50% of house purchasers since 1996 were first-time buyers. The survey also pointed out that some 62% of homeowners surveyed had no mortgage or loan on their dwellings compared to 58.8% in the same quarter of 1998. While the survey indicates that the majority of these homeowners purchased before 1980, it states that approximately one quarter of purchasers since 1996 had no mortgage.Budget 2005 also contained good news for first-time buyers with the highly significant change in the system of stamp duty, whereby the threshold at which stamp duty becomes payable by first-time buyers on second-hand properties has increased from €190,500 to €317,500. In addition, the percentage rates payable have also been reduced. Amending stamp duties for first-time buyers will improve accessibility to the second-hand housing market, reduce the dependence of the first-time buyer on the new house market and will ultimately impact on house price inflation in new homes at the starter end of the market.The Government has responded actively to the increased level of housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly. Notwithstanding the many demands on public expenditure, Government commitment to maintaining a strong social and affordable housing programme is resolute. In 2005, total Exchequer capital and current funding for housing will be approximately €1.3 billion. This is a record amount and an increase of 19.8% on the expected outturn for 2004. This increase consolidates the significant progress made in recent years, with over 13,000 households benefiting from investment under the broad range of programmes in 2005, compared to 8,500 in 1998. The total capital envelope over the period 2005 to 2009 is a massive €6 billion. To ensure that value for money is achieved for this investment, I have asked local authorities to put in place five-year action plans covering the full range of their housing programmes. These plans provide a means to ensure that these resources are used to best effect. The plans, which have been examined by my Department and discussed with authorities with a view to signing off on them by the end of the month, will allow for maximum output to be achieved through the effective planning of programmes and prioritisation in line with needs. Overall, our priority is to ensure that housing is delivered in a manner that breaks cycles of dependency and disadvantage.Government interventions have boosted the supply of affordable housing under targeted schemes for low and middle-income purchasers. More than 10,000 households have benefited under the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes since 1999. Substantial growth is anticipated in affordable housing over the coming years, as the Part V mechanism and the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative take effect.In this regard, I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Taoiseach on the release of health board lands for the initiative. This brings to more than 70, the number of projects now planned on State lands which, together with projected affordable activity under Part V, means we will exceed the target of 10,000 units proposed by the parties to the Sustaining Progress pay agreement. The key focus for the next phase of the initiative will be to significantly increase the affordable housing output through a combination of proactive local authority management of those sites for which they have direct responsibility and alternative fast-tracking strategies, such as land swaps in exchange for early delivery of units. The Harcourt Terrace site is being piloted in this respect. It is expected that more than 11,000 units will be delivered from the various affordable housing schemes between 2005 and 2007.The Bill has three sections. Section 1 deals with the sale of properties under the 1999 affordable housing scheme whereas section 2 deals with the sale of units or land under the Part V mechanism. Section 3 contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with the short title and citations.Section 1 enables a housing authority to place a charge on an affordable housing property it is proposing to sell under the 1999 scheme. Up to now the charge was registered against the mortgage deed, which allowed the local authority, as lender, to enforce it. However, where the local authority is not the lender it would have to pursue the purchaser directly for payment of the claw-back. This would be both difficult and expensive. This amendment will allow the local authority to enforce the claw-back as necessary. Section 2 is a similar provision and will enable a planning authority to place a charge on a house or land provided under Part V of the Planning Acts.I would like to explain briefly to the House how the claw-back operates in practice. Where affordable houses are sold at a discount from market value, a claw-back applies. The claw-back is an anti-profiteering mechanism and provides that where a dwelling purchased at a discount under the affordable housing schemes is resold before the expiration of 20 years from the date of purchase, a percentage of the proceeds of sale, based on the percentage discount received, shall be paid to the housing authority. The amount payable reduces by 10% for each complete year after ten years of occupation. Up to now, mortgage finance for affordable housing has been provided exclusively by local authorities through the Housing Finance Agency and this source of funding will continue. This is because the claw-back provision has not been acceptable to the private financial institutions as a first charge on the property and, consequently, has acted as a constraint up to now on lending by them.However, my Department has been in discussions with representatives of a number of financial institutions and it has been agreed in principle that the mortgage should be registered as first charge on the property, with the claw-bank as second charge. This has allowed substantial progress to be made in agreeing arrangements for the provision of such finance by the commercial lending sector. However, a number of matters still remain to be resolved, including the need to give local authorities the power to apply the claw-back as a charge on an affordable property, which is being dealt with in this Bill. I am satisfied that when the final arrangements are agreed the State's investment in the affordable property will be fully protected.The House may be aware that Bank of Ireland has already pre-announced a mortgage product it proposes to provide for affordable housing applicants when the discussions with my Department have been finalised. I also understand that the Educational Building Society is at an advanced stage of negotiations and that other financial institutions have also expressed an interest in entering this segment of the market. I welcome the competition, as it is important that consumers have choice when they are seeking mortgage finance.It has long been a Government aim to ensure that private mortgage finance is available to all potential purchasers, particularly to those wishing to purchase under the various Government affordable schemes. Notwithstanding the constraints that have operated up to now, the Government considers it appropriate that private lending agencies would also be active in this market. In addition to the need for consumer choice, it is a particular requirement of the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative that its operation and delivery have no impact on general Government finances. Hence the need for private mortgage finance as opposed to the provision of public finance through the Housing Finance Agency. The provisions of this Bill are a necessary step in achieving our aims in this area.I have pleasure in presenting the Bill to the House and I thank Members for their co-operation in processing it in a speedy manner. I look forward to hearing Senators' comments on the matter.

The Part V process as originally introduced was a disaster. It was badly thought out and did not work. In the Carlow County Council area only one application for housing was made during the period involved and that was for either seven or 11 houses, which only gave two affordable houses in effect. I accept that the amended system now in operation works better.I am amused at the use of the word "affordable". We often abuse the English language. While one would expect an affordable house advertised in the newspapers to be on sale for approximately €100,000, they are generally approximately €220,000. I paid £68,000 for my house in Carlow six years ago. It is now worth approximately €230,000. Even six years ago I regarded my house as being unaffordable as did many of my friends. It is laughable that affordable houses are now three times more expensive than they were originally.I do not know how a young person starting on the property ladder could afford to buy a house in Dublin. Like many Members, I considered purchasing a property in Dublin as I work here during the week. However, I could not afford to do so now. I went to college beside where the Minister of State's brother and Senator Brady live in Drumcondra. I have seen property prices there go through the roof in recent years and I regret not having bought a house here. The Fianna Fáil organisation was very wise buying St. Luke's some years ago. Perhaps it had vision or inside information.

The rent on that property now would probably equal the mortgage repayments if it had been bought some years ago. This is a very serious issue and I do not understand how couples buy properties. Many of the so-called cheaper properties are only 700 sq. ft. God help the couple if they have a row as even at opposite ends of the house they would still be near each other and this might contribute to marriage break-up. I do not know what these people will do when they start having children. However, that is a matter for another day.I welcome the Bill which, in the interest of facilitating access to affordable housing, Fine Gael supports. It is a two section Bill that will enable the smooth operation of the affordable housing initiative of Sustaining Progress and, in particular, the provision of affordable housing mortgages by banks. Up to now, affordable housing could only be purchased through a loan from a local authority because of the need of a clawback in the event of an early sale by those seeking to make a quick profit. Under the legislation, if an affordable housing unit is purchased and quickly resold, the sale will not be finalised unless the vast majority of the profit is paid back to the local authority. The Bill allows local authorities to enforce this clawback. Without it, they would be forced to pursue vendors for money. This would prove time-consuming, expensive and difficult.In publishing the Bill, the Department made specific mention of the Bank of Ireland's "Breakthrough" mortgage product for affordable housing which would be inaccessible if the Bill were not passed. Under the proposed arrangements, the average price of a new house would be €222,000 in Dublin and €180,000 elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Irish Home Builders Association has put forward a separate proposal for local authorities to work in partnership with builders to deliver affordable houses on council owned land banks and green spaces in existing council estates. The popular conception is that affordable housing is for the socially disadvantaged. However, support for the Bill will lead to a situation where people on any income, who feel priced out of the housing market, despite earning a good salary, can apply for a loan through private lenders.While Fine Gael welcomes the Bill, I cannot but mention that the backdrop against which it is set is depressing. A foot on the housing ladder has in recent years become a tantalising foot too far. Permanent TSB has stated that the average price paid for a house in Ireland in September was €252,431, up over €18,000 on that recorded in December 2003. This is good news for people who own property but it is bad news for those trying to get on the property ladder. The average price paid for a house in Dublin in 2004 was €330,000, while outside the capital it was €222,000. The equivalent prices in September 2003 were €296,000 and €195,000. This represents an increase of 11.5% and 13.6% in the 12 months to September 2004 in Dublin and outside Dublin, respectively.Only 315 affordable housing units were acquired under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Figures show that just 12 county councils and two city councils acquired any social and affordable houses under the Act. Dublin City Council acquired 11 houses, while Cork City Council did not acquire any. Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government sources say the modest number came about as a result of builders using stockpiles of planning permissions granted for land purchased prior to the introduction of the 20% clause in August 1999.Internal projections compiled by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimate that around 500 social and affordable houses will be built in 2004, 1,000 in 2005 and 2,000 in 2006. By October 2002, 52,726 families were waiting for local authority housing. This was up from 39,176 in 1999, an increase of almost one third. In the 2002 programme for Government, we were promised, "We will assist the voluntary housing sector so that the target of 4000 accommodation units per annum envisaged under the national development plan can be reached". However, only 187 affordable housing units were completed last year, only 315 affordable housing units were acquired under Part V of Planning and Development Act 2000 and figures show that just 12 county councils and two city councils acquired any social and affordable houses under the Act. This is a case of reality versus idealism.Government plans announced on 29 December 2003 for 3,600 affordable housing units in Dublin, Cork and Waterford will deliver 2,550 units for the capital, less than 1,000 for Cork and a meagre 100 for Waterford. In October 2002, 52,726 families were waiting for local authority housing. This was up from 39,176 in 1999 — an increase of almost one third. There are 5,581 homeless people in Ireland, living in 3,773 households. In Dublin, 4,060 people, including 1,140 children, are homeless. These figures are taken from the housing statistical bulletin for the period September 2003 to 21 January 2004. The Simon Community claims that the figures are a gross underestimation.Contrary to the opinion of the Minister of State's brother, the changes to stamp duty announced in the recent budget mean the average first-time buyer in Dublin will not be exempt from stamp duty. This is thanks to the Government's failure to set a reasonable threshold for exemption. Stamp duty should have been abolished completely for all first-time buyers. Putting in place levels and thresholds leads to difficulties, particularly in the Dublin market where it is impossible to buy a house for less than €300,000.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I challenge the Minister of State to indicate where fairly good properties can be purchased for less than €300,000 without people being obliged to move to outlying areas of Dublin. Stamp duty on second-hand houses should have been abolished for all first-time buyers. That would be a sensible approach. However, we welcome the fact that the Minister of State has, in principle, adopted a Fine Gael idea, namely, our suggestion in April that stamp duty on second-hand houses worth less than €400,000 be abolished for all first-time buyers, although the steps taken in the budget do not go far enough. According to the Minister of State's figures, the average price paid for new houses by first-time buyers in the capital was €308,000 in the second quarter of this year. With prices rising at approximately 1% per month, that average has already breached the level of €317,500 set in the budget. This means that young Dubliners struggling to get on to the property ladder may still be forced to move further away from the city — including to places such as Mullingar and Carlow — to find a home.The measures taken in respect of stamp duty were minimalist at best and totally failed to address issues such as the need to free up the supply of larger houses by reducing stamp duty for those seeking to trade down. This is a major issue because people are living in houses which are far too big for them and which they cannot maintain. These people wish to trade down but they will be penalised by the draconian stamp duty regime if they do so.Fine Gael urges the Government to go that little bit further and adopt its three-point plan for first-time buyers. The first step in this plan is the introduction of a house deposit savings scheme, similar to the SSIA scheme, to help young people who are saving for deposits for new homes. Under the scheme, first-time buyers would receive €1 for every €3 they save, provided those savings are used for a deposit on a house. No tax on interest will apply and the recipient must show regular monthly savings for a minimum of two years. The scheme will operate for both new and second-hand housesThe second step is the abolition of stamp duty on second-hand homes up to a value of €400,000 bought by first-time buyers. This would mean that a first-time buyer purchasing a second-hand home costing €325,000 would save €14,625. The third step is the front-loading of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers during the first seven years of the lifetime of a mortgage. This would provide these people with assistance when they most need it.We welcome the Bill. However, much more work remains to be done in the area of housing. The Government's record in this area is particularly bleak. I was canvassing in Kildare during the recent by-election campaign and, if I recall correctly, there is a waiting list of over 4,000 in Naas. That is a startling statistic. We are co-operating fully with the passage of the Bill in recognition of the major problems that exist. However, to borrow a phrase, much more needs to be done.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I welcome the Minister of State and I thank him for introducing this welcome Bill. I support what he said in respect of housing supply. It is marvellous that almost 69,000 units were completed in 2003, the ninth record year in a row for house completions. The figures for 2004 also look good.I was interested in his comment that thanks to the serviced land initiative, there is a good land bank available throughout the country. The figure for Dublin, at eight years, is higher than that for the remainder of the country, at five years. That is an important point. The Minister of State also spoke about the stamp duty exemption, which is very important for first time buyers of second-hand property and has been welcomed by young people.The Bill is urgent because private financial institutions wish to have access to the affordable housing mortgage market. Bank of Ireland intends to launch an affordable housing mortgage product early next year and the Educational Building Society also has an interest in this sector. On the news this morning we heard about a European mortgage, an area of the market which our financial institutions are anxious to enter and where I hope they will be successful in providing funding for affordable housing.I remember hearing the word "claw-back" as far back as the 1970s. The late Jimmy Tully was Minister for Local Government in the coalition Government that built many extra houses. It was the first time I heard of people profiteering by buying their houses from the county council, selling them and making a profit. To make matters worse, there were incentives for people to leave local authority houses and inevitably good tenants and home owners left estates. It was made clear by the Minister then, and everyone supported him, that there could not be a situation where people were making profits by buying houses and the claw-back was introduced as an anti-profiteering measure.There have been some good initiatives in recent times, particularly involving local authority, health board and other publicly owned land. The Taoiseach spoke recently about the release of health board lands for housing initiatives. This move has been popular in County Galway, where the Western Health Board has large areas of land, particularly in Ballinasloe, that could be used for affordable housing. Vocational education committees, county councils and tourism bodies could also become involved in land swapping. Land owned by the agricultural college in Athenry is being taken for road widening and for the new roads from Galway to Ballinasloe and Dublin and some of that land will become available for affordable housing. I hope those people in the Department who have received submissions from Galway County Council on those proposals will ensure there is development in the affordable housing area.It is unfair to blame local authorities for the delays with the provision of affordable housing. Yesterday's Irish Independent contained articles on many of the initiatives. The tenor of the articles was that these initiatives are being taken because the local authorities have fallen down. Some local authorities are not as enthusiastic about these schemes as others but there are many proposals from local authorities for affordable housing and they should be proceeded with. These are popular schemes and if we could build housing for the prices mentioned in the newspaper yesterday, there would be property that young people could buy and use to get on to the property ladder.I am referring to an article in yesterday's Irish Independent which is headed “Plan for 30,000 low cost homes offers new hope for house buyers”. This article describes two schemes, one which will give us 25,000 affordable houses over four years and another, involving the Irish Home Builders Association, which will result in an additional 5,000 such houses in the next two and a half years.The first scheme, which involves the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, envisages new homes with an average price of €220,000 in Dublin and €180,000 elsewhere. This radical plan is welcome. The land, owned by health boards or the Department of Agriculture and Food, is available.The Irish Home Builders Association scheme involves council developments that have large open spaces that are under-used — sometimes leading to anti-social behaviour — which could be used for affordable housing. Local authorities should consider amending county development plans to ensure this land is available.Delivery for these schemes is targeted for the next few years, with 1,500 houses in 2005, 6,000 in 2006, 8,500 in 2007 and 9,000 in 2008. I hope the initiative will be a success. Many builders say it will ensure a dramatic turnaround for people on social housing lists and for those who cannot get a foothold in the private housing market.There are many plans and it is up to us to show the will to work on them. The measures in this Bill are important because they will allow money to go back to the Exchequer. It was very simple in the past when the local authorities did everything to build houses and provide loans. We saw, however, that when people were stuck on fixed interest rates with their local authority, they could go to the private lending institutions and get their mortgages at a lower rate. Many of the county councils were glad to off-load these mortgages and have the loans provided by the financial institutions. We in County Galway have the best of both worlds. Galway County Council states that it can be a lender of last resort, and people can go back to it if they cannot get finance at a decent rate in the private sector. As far as the council is concerned, however, it has done its part in providing loans and there are other options now of which people can avail.It is great that newer schemes have been introduced by successive Governments, none more so than the present Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. The voluntary, social and affordable housing schemes will help many people. I hope the Government's good record of building more units can be continued. We should make clear that we are not always talking about houses. As Senator Browne said, various types of accommodation are available.The Bill before the House is short, but it is important because it will tidy up a loophole. Many Governments have examined this issue since 1974 or 1975, when I heard the phrase "claw-backs" used for the first time in respect of people who were allocated housing but sold them off after a number of years. I welcome the Bill, which I hope will be passed by the House quickly.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I welcome the thrust of the Bill. I support its attempts to facilitate access by private financial institutions to the affordable housing mortgage market. It will allow local authorities and housing authorities to place a charge on such properties, which is important. People renting local authority houses who were given tenancy in the 1980s have been able to purchase them, before selling them on at a huge profit, as a result of the various purchasing schemes which have been offered to them in recent years. There is nothing wrong with that — it is not illegal — but we need to consider the issues which arise. There is a need for caution in respect of the sale of assets which used to belong to local authorities. Not only should we be concerned about the exorbitant profits which have accrued in certain instances, but we should take some action.The thrust of the legislation before the House is linked to a clear commitment contained in Sustaining Progress, which was agreed by the social partners almost two years ago. The Taoiseach said in the document that the Government's target of building 10,000 affordable houses would be met in the lifetime of the agreement. In March 2004, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, admitted in response to the Labour Party's Dáil spokesman in this area, Deputy Gilmore, that none of the planned houses had been built or even started, planning applications had not been lodged and architects had not been appointed. One does not need to be a genius to work out that we have seen almost two years of inaction in respect of this commitment, which is central to the lives of ordinary working families. I refer to people on lower incomes who may have been unable to participate in the housing market for various reasons, not least of which is the rate of house price increase in recent years. I accept that nobody foresaw such an increase, but the Government has a responsibility to legislate for such people nevertheless. When the Government makes a commitment, it should stick to it.I am reminded of a discussion on a prominent radio programme last week about the McCabe issue in Limerick, which needs to be treated with great sensitivity. As I was driving to the House last Wednesday, a person from the Dublin area said on the programme that he was curious about the use by Ministers, particularly the Taoiseach, of the phrase "a Government commitment". It appeared at that stage that there was a clear intent to change a commitment made in the McCabe case, for obvious reasons. When the person in question wrote to the Government publications office to ask for a definition of the phrase "a Government commitment", he received a prompt reply in which he was informed by an official that the term has no legal standing. I will be cautious about that phrase from now on because I know it does not have any legal standing. It is clear that it does not have any standing in terms of a commitment to the electorate because the results of last June's elections bear that out. We need to examine the Government's commitment to build 10,000 affordable houses under Sustaining Progress, given that no such applications had been made to local authorities by March 2004 and not much progress has been made since.Senator Browne referred to the house price index, which was published earlier this year by Permanent TSB. The index clearly indicated that the average house price in Dublin is €320,000. Those of us who read the newspapers' property supplements, which inform us that substantial moneys are required to purchase flats, apartments and houses in Dublin, have no reason to believe otherwise. A young couple would need combined earnings of approximately €100,000 per annum if they were to qualify for a mortgage for an average priced house. That is a huge amount of money by any stretch of the imagination. Some startling issues arise when one considers that such money needs to be raised to build a house.The escalation in the price of houses has paid a significant part in the development of the circumstances we face. It is clear that almost eight years of conservative right-wing rule have not benefited families on lower incomes who cannot afford their own houses. Local authorities have not been given the resources necessary for their house building programmes, which are aimed at reducing this country's increasing housing lists. If one examines the level of housing need in every town and village, one will see that the affordability gap is increasing at an alarming rate. There is great pressure on local authority housing lists as a result. The various commitments given do not have any legal standing. Those who make such promises do not have the moral fibre to fulfil them.Approximately two years ago, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, removed the 20% clause to give builders more scope in securing planning permissions. Just 163 affordable houses were built under that clause before the permissions were gifted back to builders. The Government's sell-out to the building industry has disadvantaged many young people and resulted in a huge shortfall in affordable housing. The gift that was given by the Government two years ago, in the run-up to Christmas, was unthinkable because those who should have benefited from the 20% clause were kept out of the loop. Two years on, no applications have been made by local authorities, according to a parliamentary reply given earlier this year by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, which would make the hair stand on the back of one's head. There has not been any movement in that regard on the part of the Government, the former Minister or his successor, Deputy Roche.The Minister of State referred earlier to two press releases issued yesterday, one in his name and the other in the name of the Taoiseach. At 5.30 p.m. yesterday, the Taoiseach announced that the Government had agreed to release additional State lands for the affordable housing initiative under Sustaining Progress. In the second paragraph of a statement issued at 6 p.m. yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, he welcomed "the 10,000-unit target figure being reached". In the fourth paragraph of the statement, however, he welcomed "the 10,000-unit target figure being exceeded". If one can move from fulfilling a commitment to exceeding it in the time it takes to read from the second paragraph to the fourth paragraph of a statement, one can exceed the speed of light or the speed of sound. It is particularly unlikely when one considers that no architects have been appointed, no applications have been lodged and no real action has been taken in this area.The Government has committed itself to making State lands available on four separate occasions in recent times. Given that it is problematic to make State lands available in several areas, not least in west Cork, the problem will not be entirely solved in that way. We need prompt action. It is clear that the Government's target will not be met until the houses have been built. As of this evening, the 10,000 units to which the Taoiseach committed himself two years ago have yet to be delivered. Who will build them? I know that we are in the Yuletide season, but I do not suspect that Santa Claus will deliver the 10,000 houses. When one considers the manner in which this issue has been handled, it is no wonder Government advisers are being paid €1,200 a day. One will need to pay one's communications advisers that much money if one expects them to put a spin, or a certain interpretation, on the grossly inadequate and unprofessional manner in which the affordable housing issue is being dealt with.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on negotiating a fantastic package in the budget.He mentioned some absolutely staggering figures in this regard and alluded to the multiannual funding arrangement being put in place, amounting to €6 billion over the next four years. Both the Opposition and Government have recognised that the solution to the housing deficit lies in increased supply. A number of measures have been taken in recent years to ensure that a sufficient number of houses comes on stream to deal with the deficit.I welcome this Bill particularly because it affords a choice to those who are trying to buy a home and to local authority tenants. It also affords an opportunity to local authorities to roll over their housing stock much more quickly than they could otherwise do. They can improve the quality of the housing stock. This is just one of a range of measures to ensure that the supply is adequate.Senator Browne mentioned Dublin. I particularly welcome the housing proposals affecting Dublin City Council. One such proposal is to allow local authority tenants in flats to purchase their properties. Certain issues that arise in this regard must be addressed, including those associated with maintenance and titles to the properties, but they can be worked out.Some families in my constituency of Dublin Central have been living in complexes of flats for three or four generations. The present economic conditions are such that a couple who have raised their family are in a position to purchase an asset in which they have lived most of their lives. I would welcome any initiatives that could be taken in this area by Dublin City Council. I remember the Dublin millennium deal of 1988, which allowed tenants of Dublin Corporation to purchase their houses at a reasonable price. There was a very slow take-up of this scheme because many of the relevant details were unclear. Those who did take up the offer were extremely lucky and those who did not were kicking themselves some years later when property prices tripled and quadrupled over a short period.When we examine the progress that has been made, particularly in local authority areas, we will realise that certain areas have changed completely in the past ten or 15 years. Some local authority estates had a name for antisocial behaviour but their reputations have improved. I congratulate Dublin City Council on its estate management policy, which has improved conditions so much that properties in many local authority estates are now highly sought after. These estates are settled areas with strong communities and have all the necessary facilities.Such initiatives can lead to problems in some cases in that children of people who have a long established connection with an area and who want to buy their first property are not able to compete with other bidders because of high prices. Speculators are buying properties for rental purposes in what are ostensibly local authority estates.In Dublin, particularly in the inner city, a considerable anomaly arises in that tenants in Dublin City Council developments are paying perhaps €30 to €50 per week for a flat while others, who are literally living within yards of these developments, are paying hundreds of euro per week to rent or buy private apartments. This must be addressed. This Bill will help to alleviate the problem because it will allow the private institutions to become more involved in the local authority areas. This can only be welcomed.The aforementioned anomaly exists not only in Dublin but in most large villages, towns and cities, wherein settled communities that have been present in those locations for a long time, and which have all the necessary facilities, are outpriced because of the existence of new developments. I recall a survey that indicated that the average stay in an apartment in Dublin was two years. There should be a balanced approach to the regulations that pertain to these areas.This legislation prevents unscrupulous tenants and speculators from making profits on the back of local authority investment, thus protecting taxpayers' money. When we consider the improvements in the standard of local authority housing, we will conclude that it is understandable that steps should be taken to protect investment. In this regard, I particularly congratulate Dublin City Council on its recent strides to improve its housing stock. The design of local authority housing and the materials used therein is top-class, particularly in accommodation for senior citizens.Perhaps the Minister of State will consider examining the voluntary housing sector. Dublin City Council has worked very closely with voluntary organisations in this regard. Generally, there is no coverage for somebody buying back accommodation under a voluntary housing scheme. If Dublin City Council or a local authority is involved, there is such provision.I welcome this legislation because it increase people's choices in respect of housing.

What do the figures mean? We are now building approximately 70,000 houses annually. Therefore, if the national supply of serviced land is to last for only five more years, there is only enough serviced land for another 350,000 houses. Is the land in question zoned and serviced with roads, footpaths, lighting and sewerage systems?

It took two Bacon reports to tell us how to reduce house prices. The Minister of State outlined how to do so in a few lines and stated that the Central Bank has predicted that an increase in supply will have a dampening effect on house prices. The Opposition has been saying this for years.I wonder how productive the Bill will be in terms of claw-back. Some years ago, a Government introduced a scheme whereby tenants in local authority houses were given £5,000 to move out and obtain alternative housing. I do not know which Government was responsible but it may have been led by Fine Gael.There should be an incentive for people to move on and better themselves. Under this system it seems the claw-back would be so great that it would be counterproductive and they will not move on. It would be a retrograde step to prevent people from moving on and improving themselves. Will the Minister of State clarify this point before making a final decision on it because many people who avail of the affordable housing find after a few years that they may be in a position to better themselves? Had they been able to afford to buy their house before then it would have appreciated so it would probably do them a disservice if the claw-back is too high. The claw-back should be flexible and should not prevent people from moving forward because if they do move on, an affordable house becomes available for somebody else whose need may be greater.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and particularly welcome this short Bill. The Minister of State spelled out clearly the improvements and developments that have taken place around the country. Many local authority members have pursued the issue of affordable housing for many years. Several former local authority members are now Members of this House. They saw the need for affordable housing. Some local authority tenants' circumstances and employment prospects have improved and they are now in a position to purchase houses in private estates built at an affordable cost. This is very welcome because if that arises it will make houses available for tenants in local authority estates.We must also consider the housing schemes provided by agencies such as Respond for people who have been on local authority housing lists. There is a ruling that those tenants may not buy out their houses which in the long term is not good for the estates. Whether a local authority estate or respond development, houses are better maintained when people own them. The maintenance costs in many estates of which I am aware are substantial and will continue to be so if we do not allow people to buy out their houses.The Minister of State commented on the money being made available for housing. Irrespective of how many houses we build or what type they are there will always, unfortunately, be families on a waiting list. That has always been the way. I was a member of a local authority for several years and at one stage we had almost more houses than applicants for them. This was in rural Ireland. The scene changed as family situations changed and in some cases, following marriage break-ups, two houses were needed where formerly there had only been one. We have dealt with that.Opposition Members shout about the need for more housing and more land. Some years ago the then Minister for the Environment instructed the county manager in my county to dispose of land we required for housing; we paid a high price later in trying to build up our land bank when the Department gave us money to provide housing for the many people on our waiting list. When money was tight the councils were instructed to dispose of land and had no option.Sections 1 and 2 refer to the 20 years of residence. If people buy a house at an affordable price, 20 years is fair. After ten years there is a 10% reduction each year which is welcome. We have all seen situations where people bought out houses from local authorities under a purchase scheme many years ago. They bought at a knock-down price and shortly afterwards sold the houses and made substantial money on them while the council had people in flats and apartments looking for houses. Those sections are very important because we should make every effort to allow people who wish to purchase a house to get their first home. Everyone wants to own their own house. I welcome the Bill for that reason.I also welcome the references to the banks and their involvement. I hope they will give money to people to purchase houses but I hope they will not repossess and sell those houses in the future if the economy tightens. They did that in the past when at least local authority members could help those who had borrowed money from the authority. They could talk to the managers in the banks who were available to discuss genuine hardship cases but lending institutions now get their money when they want it and show little mercy to anyone.This Bill is welcome and much needed. If young people are in a position to purchase an affordable house that will ensure they can raise their families there. I thank the Minister of State for his work in the Department and the amount of funding he has made available to local authorities for housing schemes around the country.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I thank all the Members for their comments and general support for the Bill. We all share Senator Browne's views on affordability but "affordable" often means whether one thinks one house is affordable by comparison with another. Just because I bought a house 20 years ago does not mean I think it is affordable. To measure affordability one must look at some of the estates where these units are built and compare the price of an affordable house to one sold privately by the developer. If one gets a house for €200,000 and somebody else buys a house across the road for €290,000 then one is not doing too badly.Affordability can mean different things. There is an affordability index, which is not published, although different exercises have been done with regard to it. What is affordability? If one were to say price does not matter, one would be rubbished. It is affordability that counts, and the normal test of affordability is the percentage of disposable income which goes towards one's mortgage.Houses are slightly less affordable than previously, but it depends on the year under review. Houses are more affordable today than in 1992. Again, if I said that outside this House, I would be rubbished. However, it is a fact. We had a general election 1992 and interest rates were at16%. People were paying enormous mortgages. An extremely high percentage of take-home pay and disposable income went towards mortgages. We experienced devaluation in 1993 and mortgage rates went way down. Suddenly houses were much more affordable. The graph has been up and down. Houses are less affordable than in 1993 but more affordable than in 1992. The best test is what percentage of one's disposable income is spent on one's mortgage. If it was not for historically low interest rates we would be in big trouble. It is not fair that developers got the huge dividend from the fall in interest rates. However, that is life.Senator Browne mentioned that affordable housing is generally perceived as being for people who are socially disadvantaged. That perception is wrong. Social housing is for people who are socially disadvantaged. Affordable housing is private housing for people in a particular income bracket who want to buy their own homes and who always would have bought their own homes, but are under pressure and need State assistance. It is for individuals in a particular income bracket of average industrial pay or slightly lower, not for those who are socially disadvantaged.I release a lot of facts regarding what is built and what is undertaken. Certain people in the media and in both Houses continue to misrepresent the Department. There has been much hype about the figure of 315 houses, now 390, that have been delivered under part 5 of the scheme. That is one of four affordable housing schemes. A total of 2,600 affordable houses were built last year, and hopefully it will be a similar figure this year. Those houses came under the shared ownership and 1999 schemes and are well established at this time. The figures of 315 and 390 are from the part V scheme, which, like all schemes, has been slow to get up and running. There is no magic wand in housing. It can take up to three, four or five years from the time a policy is determined to the time it is fully established. This applies in the case of any developer, whether he is building private, social or affordable housing. It can take approximately four years from the day he gets the site to the day he hands over the keys.Senator Browne spoke of 52,000 people on waiting lists. I do not know where he got that figure. The correct figure, which I acknowledge is high, is 48,000.The abolition of and reduction in stamp duty will help considerably. Young people, as potential buyers, are extremely pleased. Media reports now say the cost of second-hand houses is jumping up as a result. I remain to be convinced of this. Until recently, the deposit and stamp duty discouraged first-time buyers from buying second-hand houses. They have been concentrating on the new house market. Approximately 40% to 45% of new homes are bought by first-time buyers. Changes to stamp duty will encourage some first-time buyers to move into the second-hand market and there will be a certain rush of interest in that area. The corollary of this is less pressure in the new house market. We cannot have it both ways. If there is a rush of people from one market to another, there will be more pressure for second-hand houses but less pressure for new houses. It should balance out after a few weeks or months. Those measures are of great benefit.The average price of a house in Dublin may be over the limit of €317,500, but that represents the average price of all houses whether new or second-hand, including those which are extremely expensive. It includes the new house which sells for €1 million and the second-hand house which sells for €3 million. They are in the mix of this average. Unfortunately, there is no published figure stating the average price of a starter home in Dublin. While the average price may be over €317,500, the average price of a starter home certainly is not. On the north side of the city, with which I am more familiar, plenty of starter homes are priced well below that average. In my job I have the pleasure of opening many new housing estates. I was in Balbriggan a few weeks ago opening an estate of houses priced between €140,000 and €160,000. There was no publicity about it whatsoever. These were starter homes and looked lovely. People will only talk about the price of the average home. However, that price includes mansions and new and second-hand homes bought by people with plenty of money.Senator Kitt spoke about the overall housing market. It is about supply, supply, supply. Some 69,000 homes were built last year. That figure will be in excess of 75,000 this year, although some have predicted 82,000. We will probably have the final figure by early February. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and into the early 1990s, the figure wandered up and down between 20,000 and 30,000. In 1993, 22,000 homes were built in Ireland. In 2004, 68,000 homes were built, and 75,000 will be built this year. This is an enormous figure. No other country has managed to increase its house production to such an extent. There is an international index which shows the number of new homes per thousand of population. We are building just under 19 new homes per thousand of population per year. Spain and Portugal are next, the UK is at three, and Sweden is at one. The census, on which constituency revisions are based, shows the population increased by 8% in the six-year period up to 2002. I do not know of another country whose population — I am not referring to the population of a city or suburb — increased by that amount.On further analysis of those figures, the number of people in the 20 to 35 years age group, the key age group for household formation, increased by approximately 18% in that six year period. Many of the people in that age bracket emigrated in the 1980s when they were aged 21 or 22 years and lived with their parents. They returned ten or 12 years later with a husband, wife, boyfriend or girlfriend and possibly a baby seeking to buy their own home. The rise in the population and in that particular segment of it is contributing to our Celtic tiger economy. They are all young, healthy, busy, working and that is marvellous, but the increase in population has exerted major pressure on the demand for housing. In many ways such pressure is a negative by-product of the booming economic growth here over several years. We are getting there when house figures have increased from 22,000 to 75,000 in ten or 11 years, which represents a sharp increase.Senator Kitt referred to the claw-back charge. It is right and proper to provide for such a charge. People are being given a site or a house at a much reduced value. The claw-back charge applies in the event of the resale of an affordable house. It is necessary to guard against profiteering. The Bill will enable the claw-back charge to be secured, irrespective of whatever source of finance is used. A person is given an affordable house at a value minus the cost of the site or at a value where the cost of the site is much reduced. It is appropriate to claw back that value if the purchaser sells the house. The full value can be clawed back if the house is sold within the first ten years following which a sliding scale will apply for up to 20 years.Senator Kitt applauded the work of local authorities in regard to social housing. In this context, the performance of some local authorities has been good while that of others has not been so good in recent years. We are agreed that local authorities require certainty of funding and a multi-annual approach to it. In the past local authorities were often advised in January, February or March of the number of houses they could build in that year, but that approach is no good. They need to have a long-term view of what they can build. In more recent years local authorities have been given a four-year multi-annual programme, whereby they know what they will be allowed to build and what they agree they can build. We are putting in place secure funding for local authorities. Those two measures have been introduced together with the introduction of action plans, which will provide local authorities with plans for the next four or five years. The capital envelope for this area is €6,000 million up to 2009 which should result in a great deal of good work.Reference was made to an article on this area in one of yesterday's newspapers. Many talks are taking place. As well as the four affordable schemes, we are exploring other proposals with the industry. There is no announcement on that, but different possibilities have been suggested and different proposals are being examined. A task force comprising of the four managers of the local authorities in Dublin has been set up and it is working with the industry exploring if there are other ways of maximising and bringing forward more quickly the supply of affordable homes which could be sold directly by the developers or the builders to house buyers rather than through the local authority system.In regard to the price of land, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution prepared a report, I do not know if it has been debated in this House. It will probably be debated in both Houses together with the Goodbody report and the NESC report, which have not yet been but are due to be shortly published. A commitment was given in the other House that when those three reports are published there would be a detailed discussion on them. I believe that will happen soon. These reports, when published, will go into all aspects of housing, the price of land, the hoarding of land and other related issues.Senator McCarthy referred to the withering rule. We changed it two years ago to encourage an increase in the supply of houses. There was talk two years ago that builders were going to run out of planning permissions, of which they had built up a fair stockpile. They only had a two-year lifespan at that time. We could have become involved in a major argument with the building industry but we changed the rule and gave those applications the longer life that would apply to a normal planning application in order to encourage an increase in the supply of houses. On a temporary basis that measure reduced the dividend coming forward for social housing. I accept that, but it resulted in an increase in the supply of houses. No success would have been gained from having a war of words with the building industry which would have resulted in no houses being built. We made a judgment call which delayed the dividend coming forward, but that resulted in our getting a good supply of houses. With the provision of 68,000 to 75,000 houses, it is not a buyers' market yet, but it is getting close to it.I am not sure whether Senator McCarthy deliberately mixed up the Part V rule with measures under Sustaining Progress. The shared ownership scheme, the 1999 scheme, the scheme under Part V of the legislation and the scheme under Sustaining Progress are the four schemes in this area. The Senator referred to the provision of 315 houses under the Part V scheme. Some 390 houses have now been produced under it, work on more than 1,800 is in progress and deals are being negotiated in respect of 2,700. While the figure of 300 is miserable, some 1,800 houses are under construction. By next year the number of houses produced under Part V will be substantial and by the following year provision under that scheme will be in full flow. It takes a while to have completions. For good or bad, two years ago builders laid many foundations, built up the walls and left the houses in that state and thereby avoided paying the levy. Then the withering rule was extended. The planning permission for most of the houses that have come forward this year and last year were secured three or four years ago. That is the reason the dividend from Part V has been slow up to come forward up to now. The 1,800 houses under construction may not all be finished next year, but most of them will be. The provision under Part V will also be good from next year onwards.Under the scheme under Sustaining Progress State lands have been offered in this respect, namely, some 70 patches of such lands. None of the houses proposed to be built on those sites have been started, but that announcement as part of the pay deal under Sustaining Progress was made only 16 or 17 months ago. They cannot be a burden on the Exchequer. The advertisement in respect of the St. Bricin's Hospital site as part of a proposed development for O'Devaney Gardens has been placed. Advertisements have also been placed in respect of Jamestown Road and Infirmary Road sites. The Harcourt Terrace site involves a land swap. Advertisements issued have sought for expressions of interest. Progress is being made. It will probably be 2006 before a sizeable number of those lands become available but they will become available. The first step is to acquire the site. We have identified the sites for in excess of 10,000 houses. Once the sites are established, we can plan ahead and start things moving. Much of the land in this regard is in other use and much of it is not serviced or zoned. It will be a few years before some of it becomes available. We are working on a number of sites and there might be a small dividend from that next year. It will probably be 2006 before most of those sites become available, but they will become available.Senator Brady referred to the sales scheme and what Dublin City Council has in mind in that respect. I believe in that scheme. Right-wing economists and such like think it is stupid to sell our housing stock. Those on the left are now objecting to Dublin City Council's plan. It is quite extraordinary that for different reasons the two extremes of the political divide have reservations regarding sale schemes and that most sensible people in between support them. When the NESC report is published, and it examines the issue in some depth, those who support sale schemes might be needed.One cannot have a sale scheme involving voluntary housing. I hear objections all the time from people in such housing who would like to buy. However, the housing associations, perhaps dominated by the big ones, are very strongly against allowing their tenants to buy. Tenants in smaller associations down the country should lobby through their housing association for more flexible arrangements. The Irish Council for Social Housing, which represents voluntary housing, has very strong views and is against tenants buying out units. Some of them should have been co-operatives.Senator Paddy Burke stated that there should be an incentive for people to buy their affordable houses. However, an affordable house is for somebody who cannot afford to buy a house on the open market because his or her income is too low. The State gives such people a site free or at a much reduced price. If they do better later in life they will be able to sell, pay the claw-back and buy a house on the market. I accept that in five, ten or fifteen years paying the claw-back might restrict entry into the private market. However, nobody comes to affordable housing if they are able to buy on the private market.The Senator was not referring to 1985. That was a different issue involving a scheme introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. That scheme seemed like a good idea at the time, given that houses cost approximately £22,000. In Dublin people were given £5,000 plus mortgage interest relief. Many people got a lump sum of £8,000 to buy a house at £22,000. The scheme was so successful that people were handing back their keys to local authorities at a rate of knots. It created a huge supply of local authority accommodation. In my constituency there were approximately 300 vacancies in a certain flat complex and there was nobody to whom to allocate them. It was so successful that it denuded estates of anybody who had a job and left behind people who did not have a job. It was a well-intentioned scheme and I probably thought it was a good one when I first heard about it. However, it did much damage and it took many estates years to recover lost ground. The affordable housing scheme is totally different.Senator Moylan spoke about the Respond Housing Association. I have dealt with that. Senator Kitt mentioned the lending institutions. He must not have a very nice bank manager. I do not believe there are many repossessions in Ireland. I am told that house repossession in Ireland is one of the lowest in Europe. It may be that the Senator knows of one or two cases where there was not much understanding. If people get in contact at an early stage, most financial institutions are reasonable provided MABS or some other organisation is helping.I am sorry to be so long-winded. There were many points to be responded to. I thank Senators for their support and co-operation in dealing with this Bill so quickly.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I enjoyed this debate on an area for which I am spokesperson. It was certainly thought provoking. However, the sad reality is that there are tens of thousands of people on waiting lists. The Minister of State should also acknowledge that there are thousands of people in my age group, in their early thirties, who still live at home. Parents who have done their best to rear them and get rid of them, are stuck with them. It is causing a major problem. I understand there is now a helpline for parents who are totally frustrated that their 30 year old son or daughter is showing no sign of moving on and is quite happy to stay at home. I was thrown out of my own nest a few years go, which is probably just as well. This is obviously a serious issue.It surprised everybody to see reports in the newspapers that some local authorities are not spending the moneys allocated to them. To borrow a phrase from Senator Leyden, they should be named and shamed. In Carlow we are waiting for a housing scheme in Fruithill that I thought would have been built by now. It is a mixture of social, affordable and local authority housing. Unfortunately for us, the land in question is just inside County Laois which means that Carlow Town Council must deal with Laois County Council. Dealing with the planning authorities is a disaster because a different authority is dealing with the application.It would be beneficial if the Minister of State could state clearly which authorities allocated money did not spend it and give the reasons. I am sure every councillor in the country is currently attending meetings of town councils and county councils asking why housing is not being provided in their area. They are being told to blame the Department. If, as it appears from what the Minister of State said, the problem is not with the Department, that information should be made available to councillors and public representatives. People are waiting for years for housing. The sad reality in Carlow is that many people involved in the co-operative movement have left and moved on because they are so frustrated at the length of time it is taking to get a house. That is a sad reflection on all of us.Something I have always been puzzled by is the concept of empty stock. I often wonder how much housing stock is fully occupied and whether occupancy could be increased. Perhaps there is scope in a future census to obtain such figures. In Carlow we are beginning to see the appearance of empty stock where houses cannot be rented out and are lying idle for months. Perhaps the Minister might examine this in the context of a census. I would like to know the real figures. As the Minister correctly points out, while we have never built so many units before, there is still a major problem. It could be that private investors are buying a second, third, fourth or fifth property, and that could be distorting the figures. While Fine Gael welcomes the Bill, much work remains to be done in this area.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I thank Members for their co-operation. I accept that 48,000 people are on waiting lists. A major new assessment in this regard will be undertaken next spring and a major assessment of social housing needs takes place every three years. However, many of those on waiting lists are among the 60,000 families on rent allowance and, therefore, many of them are in suitable although not long-term accommodation.With regard to 30 year olds living at home, the position is worse if they have lived away for some years and must return home. We all like our freedom, whether one is a young person who has lived away or a mother at home. Some 15 years ago this problem did not arise because people emigrated. There was a certain number of five, ten and 15 year olds but the figures then dipped because people emigrated. They are not emigrating now but are working. Some live in family homes while some buy their own homes. However, I agree that some mothers want to get rid of some children. They might also have got rid of them 20 years ago but the children would have gone to New York, Australia or elsewhere. Life is not perfect.We recently provided figures from a ten-year list detailing the achievements of local authorities. The multi-annual programme was not in place for some of those years. However, I prefer to use the figures for the four years up to 2003 because we had agreed multi-annual programmes with the councils for those years. We are doing the same for the following four years. We would agree with a local authority, for example, that 400 local authority houses would be built in Carlow over the next four years and that the funding was guaranteed. However, as the local authorities would not get the money until they built the houses, there was no question of money being diverted. Instead, some local authorities did not draw down all the available funding.It is not fair to detail the figures because a local authority might have achieved much in regard to local authority housing but not in regard to voluntary or affordable housing. To give a complete picture, one would need to provide total figures for the provision of local authority, voluntary and affordable housing. With regard to the four year programme which ended in 2003, the key figure is not how many houses were built but what percentage of their intended building targets local authorities achieved. The local authority in County Cavan was the best with 145%, that in County Longford achieved 142% and that in County Laois 129%, followed by the local authorities of counties Tipperary, Westmeath, Sligo, Monaghan, Donegal, Offaly and Wexford, which was the last authority to achieve 100% of its target. The following counties achieved less than 100%: Louth, Clare, Wicklow, Meath, Roscommon, Carlow, Limerick, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Waterford, etc. I will not go any further as it might be embarrassing. However, the percentage of target achieved goes as low as 44% whereas the best was 145%. The county which came bottom with 44% is marvellous at building affordable homes but it is not good at building social homes.We learned there is no point telling a local authority what it can build in February. A multi-annual programme must be agreed with the authority so it knows what it can do over the following four years, and there needs to be certainty in regard to funding, which has been achieved. Whatever about the past, all local authorities had imperfections but some managed to overcome these better than others. Equally, the Department might not have been perfect in the past but it is developing the multi-annual programmes and has put the required funding in place.I accept there are empty houses. Some buy these and hope to sit on them and do well from rising prices. There is also much under-used stock, which raises different issues. However, there is no way of forcing somebody to sell or use their home unless some kind of tax on idle homes were introduced. Given house price increases in recent years, it is likely some have let homes sit on the basis that they were making money on the appreciating value. This is wrong and one wonders why they would not let the homes. In some cases, there are disputes over wills, family rows and other situations. If Senator Browne wishes to propose a tax on those who leave their homes empty for more than six months, I might take it up if I am brave enough. Some of these ideas seem practical until one gets clobbered. I thank Members for their co-operation in passing the Bill.

In page 46, before section 72, to insert the following new section:72.—Notwithstanding sections 55 and 73, the exchange of any type of information or other form of co-operation between—(a) the Garda Commissioner or any member of the Garda Síochána and the Ombudsman Commission,(b) The Garda Commissioner or any member of the Garda Síochána and the Inspectorate,(c) the Ombudsman Commission and a comparable body outside the State,made in the course of, and in accordance with, the duties of that person's office, shall not be an offence.".The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the ombudsman commission can co-operate with or provide information to an ombudsman of another police force, where that might be required. It also allows for the free flow of information between the Garda Síochána and the ombudsman commission.

The main focus of the provisions of sections 55 and 73 is on the offence of disclosure of information to third parties, which might have a harmful effect. A range of penalties is provided for, depending on the circumstances relating to the illegal disclosure. There is no suggestion in these provisions that what might be regarded as routine, day-to-day exchanges of information, or other forms of co-operation with the Garda Commissioner or members of the force and the ombudsman commission, or the inspectorate, might be construed as offences.In addition, I would be concerned if the provisions of section 73 could be put aside for the purpose of the ombudsman commission providing information which might have a harmful effect to comparable bodies outside the State. Such a provision could undermine the confidentiality provisions in the Bill.

In page 49, subsection (1), lines 19 to 26, to delete all words from and including "Commission—" in line 19 and substitute "Commission by any member of the public".The purpose of this amendment is to allow any member of the public to make a complaint to the ombudsman commission. I feel this would be a better situation and would promote more confidence in the Garda Síochána than the technical rule of the Bill, as it stands, on the issue of who can make a complaint. Section 75(1) states:Subject to section 76, a complaint concerning any conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána that is alleged to constitute misbehaviour may be made to the Ombudsman Commission—(a) by a member of the public who is directly affected by, or who witnesses, the conduct, or,(b) on behalf of that member of the public, by any other person if the member of the public on whose behalf the complaint is being made consents in writing or orally to its being made . . .That procedure is similar to how one might make a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding county councils. The wording needs to be broadened in the case of the ombudsman commission, as it does for the Ombudsman. It is relevant to Members of the Oireachtas. For example, before I, as a Member of the Oireachtas, could make a complaint to the Ombudsman about a county council, I would have to obtain the consent of the person affected. There may be reasons people might not want to give me that consent, or may not want to make the complaint themselves. However, as a public representative, I might feel the issue should be raised with the Ombudsman.The same applies with regard to the Garda Síochána. My point does not only apply to Members of the Oireachtas because others may feel similarly that a complaint should be made to the Ombudsman about a particular matter but they are not directly linked in the way outlined in section 75. The Minister should consider amending the section in the manner suggested by the Labour Party.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I oppose amendments Nos. 107 and 108. Amendment No. 107, at the very least, leaves open the possibility for complaints to be made based only on hearsay. I have no doubt that it would also lead to the making of frivolous and unwarranted complaints to the commission. It would be entirely unsatisfactory to leave open the possibility for any person, upon hearing in passing of an alleged instance of misconduct, to make a complaint to the ombudsman commission.The provision in the Bill, which defines complaints extensively, is reasonable and sensible. Since it includes any member of the public, there are no age or citizen thresholds. If the complainant cannot make the complaint in person, he or she can make it through any other person and there are no restrictions as to who this other person might be. This allows for the possibility, for example, that a parent, guardian, sibling, child, other family member, friend, teacher, lawyer, priest or some other chosen person can present the complaint.The provision is as wide as it can be. The only requirement in the case of a complaint being made on a person's behalf is that the complainant must give written and oral consent that the complaint be made on his or her behalf. Moreover, this formality may be dispensed with if the person who wishes to make a complaint is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental condition. There is deliberate intention behind the use in section 75(1) of the words "directly affected" and the reference to a person who has allegedly "witnessed" bad conduct. The purpose is to rule out the making of complaints on the basis of indirect observation through, for example, a video transmission or other such medium.Regarding amendment No. 108, the purpose of the Bill is to provide a framework for the making of complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda Síochána. A member of the public, for these purposes, cannot be a member of the Garda Síochána. It is not appropriate for this mechanism to be opened up to allow members of the force to make complaints against other members.Apart from that policy ground, it would open up the prospect that every dispute, rivalry and disagreement within the force would be liable to be referred to the ombudsman commission for consideration. As the Minister has indicated, members of the Garda Síochána should bring such matters to the attention of a senior officer so that they may be dealt with in accordance with Garda disciplinary regulations.The concerns of a member of the Garda Síochána could well come to the attention of the ombudsman commission in a different manner. Section 94(4) provides:The Ombudsman Commission may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so and without receiving a complaint, investigate any matter that appears to it to indicate that a member of the Garda Síochána may have——(a) committed an offence, or(b) behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.Moreover, section 94(5) gives the Minister certain powers that would be exercisable in these types of cases.Section 107 provides that the Minister may make regulations concerning the maintenance of discipline in the Garda Síochána. Subsection (3)(a) stipulates that these regulations may provide for the procedures to be followed if, “it appears or is alleged that an act has been done or omission made that may be the subject of disciplinary action.” I understand the Minister has every intention of updating the existing disciplinary regulations and making the regulations provided for under section 107.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Will the Minister of State reconsider the issue raised in amendment No. 108? I can see no reason that members of the Garda Síochána should be excluded from making a complaint to the ombudsman commission. Some gardaí may have crucial information about bad practices and abuses they have witnessed. They should be in a position to bring such cases to the commission rather than to a superior officer. I have already raised the Donegal case with the Minister. There must be another avenue available to a garda who has information but is aware that his or her superior officers are involved in collusion or some other misconduct.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I agree with the Minister of State on this issue. It is important to protect whistleblowers in an organisation such as the Garda Síochána. People must feel free to bring matters of concern to attention. However, it complicates matters both for the ombudsman commission and for members of the Garda Síochána if we choose to mix up internal disciplinary matters and the external remit of the commission.I am reassured by the provision in section 94 which allows the commission to act on its own initiative when the public interest so requires. The provision does not unnecessarily restrict the triggers that could be used to bring that about and could well include instances where the commission has knowledge of an issue that has been brought to its attention by a member of the Garda Síochána. It is better to retain this provision than to complicate matters by incorporating amendment No. 108.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I am concerned that there will be people who will not make a complaint or consent to another person making the complaint on their behalf. However, there may be some other person who wishes to raise the subject of the complaint with the ombudsman commission. How, for example, will a public representative present an issue to the commission if he or she does not have the necessary consent? The Minister of State has mentioned other provisions but they do not address the issue I have raised in amendment No. 107.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	521	Members should remember that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for all matters relating to discipline within the Garda Síochána. The provisions of the Bill dealing with the Garda ombudsman commission have been drafted with this very much to the fore. The Commissioner is the chief executive of the force, to use Senator Quinn's analogy on Second Stage. As such, he or she should properly be responsible for actions taken by members of the organisation.The Minister has given much consideration to the issues raised in these amendments but we must oppose them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I move amendment No. 109:
In page 53, lines 21 and 22, to delete paragraph (a).Amendment No. 109 proposes to delete lines 21 and 22 of section 84. Sections 84 and 85 are linked because they provide the legal provision for the ombudsman commission to deal with a complaint as it wills. This provision deserves some attention. Section 84 stipulates that the commission has three choices in cases where complaints are not resolved informally or if they warrant investigation. The first choice, contained in paragraph (a), is to “refer the complaint to the Garda Commissioner to be dealt with in accordance with section 86.” Paragraph (b) provides that the commission may choose to conduct an investigation under section 87. The third choice, under paragraph (c), is to direct a designated officer of the commission to investigate the complaint.I have no difficulty with paragraphs (b) and (c) but propose, under this amendment, that paragraph (a) should be deleted. The purpose of this Bill, and this section in particular which deals with the establishment of the commission, is that gardaí should not be investigating gardaí. Section 84 provides a significant opt-out for the commission in that it allows it to ask the Garda Commissioner to consider matters. The Minister of State may say these are minor, casual issues that do not require a significant degree of investigation on the part of the commission. However, they might not be minor or casual to the person making the complaint. I am informed that the only guarantee we have regarding an independent investigation is that incidence of death or serious harm will be investigated by the commission. It seems everything else has the potential to be investigated by the Garda.We are concerned that insufficient thought has been given in allowing the very serious opt-out clause in section 84(a). While we are informed an automatic investigation will take place in the case of death or very serious harm, no such guarantee exists for other matters. Who will determine what is serious? It is not appropriate to give the commission an opt-out allowing gardaí to investigate gardaí.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I would like to say a few words from my experience. What is needed in an ombudsman is an office that will deal with serious issues. We also want to inculcate into an organisation like the Garda a culture in which it will face up to and deal with complaints itself. My son was home over the weekend from Yale. He had been overtaken by a police car coming up to a junction and he reported this to the police. He got a very courteous e-mail form the Yale police department thanking him for calling the matter to its attention and informing him that it had been brought to the attention of the officer who had admitted it. I cannot think of any police force in these islands that would have given him that sort of response.Organisations should be forced to consume their own smoke in the same way as large business organisations deal with dissatisfied customers. There is much to be said for allowing the ombudsman to tell an organisation that it should be able to deal with it itself and let him know the outcome. For the early years of its operation, the ombudsman should be slow to do that. I defined this in another report as being a policy akin to purchase and leaseback. As people show their ability to deal as an organisation with complaints, they should be allowed to do so.I would prefer the Bill to leave this facility to the ombudsman commission, always remembering that the commission is required to report to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas on its operations. It would be a mistake to force the commission to launch a serious investigation of everything coming to its attention and would divert it from investigating the really important matters in which it should be involved.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Minister is opposed to these amendments as the intention behind them is to remove the provisions in the Bill providing for the referral of complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation, even in circumstances where they might be supervised by the ombudsman commission.This brings us back to the point about gardaí investigating gardaí. Senators may have some misunderstanding here. The provisions of the Bill follow very closely the relevant provisions, sections 56 and 57, of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which established the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Those provisions in turn were developed from the recommendations in the 1997 report by Senator Maurice Hayes.Senator Maurice Hayes concentrated on three main models for investigation of complaints against the police following his comprehensive study of the various systems in operation in other jurisdictions around the world. These were investigation by the police with external oversight, complete handling and investigation of police misconduct by a body external to the police service and a combination of police investigation with external oversight for more minor matters with more serious ones being investigated by the external body. The first of these more or less corresponded with the then system in place in Northern Ireland, England and Wales with some variations of it being found in the Garda Síochána Complaints Board here as provided for in the 1986 Act, and in New Zealand and Ontario.Very significantly for the purposes of this debate, Senator Maurice Hayes reported he saw no example of the second option of complete investigation by an external body investigating all cases and recommending action, whether civil or disciplinary. A quote from the relevant paragraph 13.31 in the report is illuminating. Senator Maurice Hayes noted that such a system:. . . would remove the responsibility completely from the police (even for the most minor cases). It would do this at a time when there is a need and a drive, not least from within the police, for greater management responsibility in the police service. It would also present difficulties in terms of finding sufficient investigating officers to manage the workload. There would also be problems in breaking into the police culture. Such a body is unlikely to gain police confidence easily and this in turn is bound to affect its credibility.The final option is the mix of police investigation with independent oversight and investigation by an independent complaints body, usually in the most serious cases. Informal resolution may also be employed by the police for minor matters. Senator Maurice Hayes concluded that a variant of this latter system would be the ideal towards which the police complaints service in Northern Ireland should develop. However, he also said that in view of the lack of confidence in the system in that jurisdiction, the ombudsman should probably investigate all but those complaints considered suitable for informal resolution.In his scheme he recommended that complaints would be categorised under the following three headings: serious complaints possibly involving criminal action, such as death in custody, serious injury, etc., which the complaints body would have a statutory duty to investigate; less serious, but still substantial complaints which might, at the discretion of the complaints body, be remitted to the police for investigation and report, either supervised or unsupervised; and quality of service type complaints which would be remitted to the police for informal resolution.It is strange, therefore, that having been exhorted to follow as far as possible the situation which obtains in Northern Ireland, calls are being made to depart from that system in a way which is radically different from the approach adopted there. Sections 82 to 90 in the Bill deal with the ways in which complaints against the Garda Síochána are to be investigated by the independent ombudsman commission. In essence in cases of death or serious harm to a person, the ombudsman commission alone must investigate the matter and this applies even where no complaint has been made. In other cases, the commission can require the Garda Commissioner to investigate the matter. Such an investigation is subject to certain conditions as to the nomination of the investigating officer and the procedural safeguards as set out in sections 86(8) to 86(11), inclusive, which are built in throughout the process.Alternatively the commission can directly supervise the Garda investigation, again with the power to attach conditions. In those cases where the ombudsman commission decides to use members of the Garda Síochána it can require that they be used under direct supervision or it can grant wide latitude to the investigators to do the job in a quasi-autonomous way subject to the power of revocation.In no way does the Minister accept that the Bill provides for the Garda to investigate itself. No matter what route is chosen by the ombudsman commission to investigate complaints, ranging from the most serious allegations, including those relating to the commission of possible criminal offences, to those at the lower end of the scale which may involve breaches of discipline, the commission retains absolute control and direction over the whole proceedings. It would be completely unworkable for the commission to have to investigate every matter relating to a breach of discipline, no matter how small. It is entirely appropriate for such matters to be dealt with by the commissioner who is, as I have said before, responsible for the quality of service provided by his or her organisation.The point remains that the ombudsman commission is in overall control. In this House last Friday, during the course of his contribution to the debate on amendments Nos. 96 and 97, the Minister made it abundantly clear that nothing is wrong with gardaí investigating other gardaí. They do so every day of the week and we would all be aware of the cases they have pursued forensically across a wide spectrum of illegal activities by a few rotten apples, who unfortunately have betrayed their oath and the trust placed in them.

I would be satisfied if he could answer the question I am about to pose in the affirmative. Is he saying that at all stages the commission will be in possession of a complaint? In other words, if a complaint is made and the commission hands it over to the Garda because it involves a minor matter, will the commission, at some stage, be able to re-examine the case? Do I understand that it will have full control over complaints? While it awaits an initial determination of complaints from the Garda, will the commission be able to re-investigate a matter if something more serious emerges?

We are obviously not going to get anywhere with the Minister of State and we accept what he said. We will, therefore, withdraw our opposition to the section.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I move amendment No. 110:
In page 56, subsection (3), between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"(b) shall be granted legal representation and related costs,”.People who are brought before the ombudsman commission should be entitled to costs and legal representation. I hope the Minister of State will take on board the amendment because there is no reason the costs incurred by anybody coming before the commission should not be paid.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I support my colleague in respect of this matter. No one wants to ensure that the legislation might represent an opportunity for lawyers to become even more wealthy. However, if someone makes a serious complaint to the commission — and even if the commission investigates said complaint in a private forum, which undoubtedly would be the case — I would have thought that basic legal representation would be afforded to the complainants on the basis that they would be doing not only themselves but also the public a service by bringing forward a complaint. It is important that people dealing with the commission would be given the right to representation. Many of the matters involved would be intricate and detailed and people would need to be advised throughout proceedings. This has not been provided for in the legislation and perhaps the Minister of State would indicate why that is the case.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I am not prepared to accept this amendment. The question of payment of costs in respect of legal representation in these circumstances has been raised with me on a number of occasions by the Garda associations and I have resisted at every stage. There is no provision for the payment of costs in respect of legal representation under the existing Garda Complaints Board scheme. I do not propose to change that. As I understand it, the Garda associations have arrangements in place for the provision of support to members who decide to avail of legal representation.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	535	This makes my blood run cold and it would be almost unworkable. The entire point of the ombudsman system is to provide a less formal means than that available in a court in order to deal with particular situations. Once the idea of representation for any group is imported, every other group will seek equal representation. It is not only the cost involved about which I am concerned. Allowing representation would have a dramatic impact and would probably bring the system to a grinding halt.The procedure we always used was that a person could bring a friend with them. That person was often a trade union representative or perhaps a solicitor but he or she would have been present in a personal capacity. I know of no ombudsman system anywhere in the world that admits of legal representation in that way. If people think that an ombudsman is exceeding his or her powers or has not given proper consideration to a complaint, he or she may be the subject of a review. However, that is a different matter. Allowing legal representation would hideously complicate the workings of the Act.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Would the Minister of State take on board Senator Maurice Hayes's suggestion that a person making a complaint could bring a friend with them, whether it be a trade union representative or a member of a representative association? That might come some part of the way towards meeting what is intended in the amendment. People should be allowed to bring some form of representation with them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I appreciate the points made by Senator Maurice Hayes. However, my experience — albeit in respect of the existing Garda Complaints Board system — is that the big legal guns make a difference. I was involved in a particular case and I encouraged someone to take a case all the way to the courts. The person to whom I refer was an ordinary citizen and his mother was not of huge means. Not only did they come up against the might of the individual garda involved but also that of his entire representative organisation, which gave him 100% support. The latter made a huge difference in the case to which I refer. Admittedly, the case had been referred to the courts by the Garda Complaints Board at the end of its procedure. We need to take account of the fact that vulnerable people making complaints with the best possible intentions will be fought the entire way. Gardaí, whether it is right or wrong, have the full force of a representational organisation behind them, whereas ordinary people do not.I am inclined to accept what Senator Maurice Hayes said in respect of the need for a person making a complaint to have with them a witness or someone to offer them support while trying to tease out the complaint with the investigating officer. That is a good suggestion. However, we should not underestimate the power of the legal machine when it gets going. In the case to which I refer, a poor result was obtained from the court because the person involved could not afford to meet, head-on, the full force of the legal representation arrayed against them.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Drawing on the analogy of the courts may be sending us down the wrong road. The ombudsman procedure is not confrontational in nature. An ombudsman operates in a manner similar to that adopted by French investigative magistrates. I would regard it as the duty of an ombudsman to observe the type of balance to which the Senator refers in order to ensure that ordinary people are decently represented and provided with every opportunity to present their cases. The ombudsman procedure does not, of its nature, allow for head-to-head confrontations in which people are browbeaten by opposing counsel.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I did not propose the amendment. If I did, I would have to declare an interest because I am a solicitor. Is there an appeal or grievance procedure available to people who might be dissatisfied with the handling or outcome of their complaints?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I understand that a complainant can bring with him or her a friend or someone of that nature.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Is provision made for an appeal or grievance procedure?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	542	There is such a procedure.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The entire nature of the ombudsman system is that there are no appeals. There cannot be appeal after appeal after appeal. The essence of the thing is that there is one fair minded person or group of people in possession of the facts looking at something and making a judgment. It may be reviewed on the grounds it was not done properly or people were not listened to but, in the sense of creating a further court of appeal, that does not arise.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I did not mean a court of appeal.

In page 58, subsection (1)(b), line 18, after “investigation” to insert “and any interview conducted with a member arrested under this Act shall be subject to procedures which shall be prescribed by the Minister for the video and audio recording of interviews with arrested persons generally”.This amendment ensures that the procedures that apply to everyone else would apply in the case of an investigation by the ombudsman commission.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The Minister is not opposed to the principle behind this amendment. It is, however, unnecessary to amend the Bill to achieve its objective. As of now, 96% of interviews are electronically recorded. I am currently studying the third report of the steering committee on audio-video recording of Garda questioning of detained persons, presented to me last September. The committee is satisfied with the operation of the electronic recording of interviews to date and it is pleased to note the high percentage of interviews that are now recorded under the appropriate regulations.Under the existing procedures, as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997, a member of the Garda Síochána who is being interviewed about any alleged offence, or suspected illegal activity, has the right, like anyone else, to have the process recorded. It follows that in the circumstances covered by the Bill, the same situation should apply.It is also relevant that in accordance with the provisions of section 100 of the Bill on the drawing up of protocols between the ombudsman commission and the Garda Commissioner, interviews conducted by the designated officers of the ombudsman commission will be conducted by them in interview rooms in existing Garda stations.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I move amendment No. 112:
In page 59, subsection (5), lines 8 and 15, to delete all words from and including "but" in line 8.We have tabled this amendment because we do not agree with the exception provided in section 90 and we do not feel there is any logical reason powers under the Offences against the State Act and the Interception of Postal Packets Act should not be available to the ombudsman commission when it is investigating a possible offence by a member of the Garda Síochána.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The Minister is opposed to this amendment. The powers at present available to members of the Garda Síochána under the legislative provisions in question are highly unlikely to be required by designated officers of the ombudsman commission for the purpose of conducting investigations into complaints from members of the public about members of the Garda Síochána. It is for that reason that these provisions are specifically excluded from the definition of the term "enactment" in sections 5(a) and (b).The provisions in question relate to the Offences against the State Acts, particularly the powers of extended detention periods and the telephone intersection measures in the 1993 Act. In the case of the latter, however, the designated officers of the ombudsman commission will have the same powers that are available to a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána to obtain the billing information or call-related information from service providers, but not the call content, to assist them in their investigations in serious cases. That is the purpose behind the reference to the application of section 13(2) of the 1993 Act in section 95(b) of the Bill.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I move amendment No. 113:
In page 59, subsection (1), lines 18 and 19, to delete "complaint under section 90” and insert ‘‘a matter under this Act”.This relates to the power to search a Garda station, which should not be restricted to investigations under section 90 but should be available when any matter under this Bill is being investigated. Why is the Minister so anxious to restrict the powers of the ombudsman commission which he is establishing?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Why is section 91(1) restricted to a complaint under section 90? Surely it should relate to any matter pertaining to the Bill? This is convoluted. The investigating officer operating on behalf of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has the power to turn up at any station without any information being given to the PSNI. Section 91(3) states:Before issuing an authorisation to search a Garda Síochána station designated by regulation under section 109 as one that, for reasons related to the security of the State, may not be searched except to the extent specified in a direction of the Minister, the Ombudsman Commission shall notify the Garda Commissioner and the Minister of its intention to issue the authorisation.Are we not making this complicated? The commission, through its investigating officers, should have the power to turn up when, as often and to as many stations as it likes. That is the process in Northern Ireland. If the ombudsman informs the Garda Commissioner, and if it is known that people are coming, does that not defeat the purpose of having the power to search in the first place?
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I found this section hard to understand in the general tenor of the Bill, which is to provide for a system of investigation of complaints that would have public confidence and that would be open and transparent. All of a sudden power is given to other people to block the ombudsman at a critical point in an investigation.One of the difficulties in the old situation in Northern Ireland was that the Chief Constable could decide what was or was not a complaint. This is the same. I am not saying that either a Minister or a Garda Commissioner would in any way collude in the covering up of matters but delay and complexity are being interposed. There organisations have their own means of disseminating information and grapevines work in such a way that sometimes people must get in quickly to ensure evidence is secured. The greater the delay and the more the complication, the more difficult it becomes. It would be a better Bill if this section were removed.I can see the need for some sensible agreement between the ombudsman and the Garda Commissioner on protocols about how these things would be advanced so people would not be swinging from the rafters in Garda stations at all hours of the day and night. Nevertheless, it has been made complicated and it might go some way not only towards defeating the purpose of the Bill but of reducing its impact in the public mind in terms of independence.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I am inclined to agree with Senators Brian and Maurice Hayes. It seems to me that the element of surprise is one of the ombudsman's better tools when raiding a Garda station. If one will have to go to the Garda Commissioner to seek his permission before doing so, the power of the investigation would surely be damaged if — God forbid — the Garda Commissioner were involved in any form of collusion.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I oppose the amendment because it seeks to give the commission the power to authorise searches of Garda stations in circumstances in which a complaint might not involve an offence. With two exceptions which we have discussed, designated officers of the ombudsman commission will have all the powers of gardaí when conducting investigations into complaints which appear to involve offences. The clear intention of section 90 is that such powers will be used for the purpose of investigating complaints which appear to involve offences only. Similarly, the power to search Garda stations applies for the purpose of investigations under section 90, but only if the commission is satisfied that the designated officer has reasonable cause for suspecting that the member under investigation is guilty of an offence, and has reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of, or relating to, the commission of the offence is to be found in the station, or in the possession of any other person to be found there. It would be wholly inappropriate for the provisions to be extended to circumstances in which offences are not involved and I am not prepared to move in that direction.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I will not pursue the amendment, but I hope the Minister of State will reconsider it on Report Stage. The general consensus of the Senators present is that the ombudsman commission may not be as effective as we would like if the element of surprise is removed. I will not press the amendment now, but I ask the Minister of State to return with a way of dealing with the matter on Report Stage.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	558	Can I discuss the complicated and convoluted way in which this section is drafted, which was raised by Senators Maurice Hayes and Kett? The Minister of State has said it is appropriate to search a station if it is considered that a serious offence under section 90 may have taken place. Why is a considerable opt-out clause provided for in sections 91(3) and 91(4)? What is the point of informing the Garda Commissioner that one is coming to visit a station? Surely that defeats the purpose of surprise, which is needed when one is trying to acquire information and evidence. If we accept for the moment that the offence in question is a serious one under section 90, what is the point of the ombudsman commission telling the Garda Commissioner that it is coming to a station, as provided for in sections 91(3) and 91(4)?

It is clear that there is a need to protect sensitive information. Everybody should not be allowed to tramp over those dealing with certain matters. I referred earlier to certain protocols. When I was doing this job in the North, I encountered cases of people who were refused permits to work in electricity stations, for example, because of information that was held. I agreed with the chief constable at the time that I, or a particularly designated officer, who happened to be an ex-policeman, should be allowed to go to see such information. The Government and the Minister could prevent the ombudsman from publishing a report that appeared damaging to state security, but they could not prevent the ombudsman from seeing the information in the first place.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	567	Yes.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	572	Perhaps we could consider a proposal along the lines suggested by Senator Maurice Hayes. Rather than designating what can be checked by the ombudsman, I would approach it from the other angle. I would identify what the ombudsman cannot access, for example on the grounds of its being sensitive. If identifying such matters by name is a security breach in itself, perhaps they could be identified by letter, for example. If there is a subsequent dispute or a further investigation is required, the Minister should be able to appoint an independent Garda officer who could examine that and satisfy himself as to whether the initial decision to protect the information for security reasons was valid. The way in which this section of the Bill is written does not seem to allow for any recourse or subsequent system of appeal. This matter needs to be examined so that it does not give rise to any abuse.

I do not think we can prescribe the mechanism for achieving that. It is important that the ombudsman should not be denied the information which is necessary if he is to conduct a thorough investigation. A certain level of protection is needed to ensure that security privileges cannot be claimed on relatively dubious grounds.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I am mindful of what Senator Jim Walsh has said. Under section 91(4) of the Bill, the Garda Commissioner can reject a request to search a station "on grounds relating to the security of the State". It is interesting that the Bill does not define what "the security of the State" means. If one tries to use those grounds to refuse to accept a search, one has to define what they mean. Section 91(9) states that a Garda station is "any premises where a member of the Garda Síochána is stationed". The point made by Senator Jim Walsh is valid. What documents are we talking about? What is the nature of the issues which may relate to "the security of the State"? Any issue could be included. Perhaps the Minister of State will return to this matter on Report Stage.

In page 62, subsection (2), line 14, after "concerned," to insert "it may institute criminal proceedings against the member and if it decides not to do so".The Minister rejected a previous amendment in this regard. This amendment proposes that the Garda ombudsman commission should be entitled to prosecute members of the Garda Síochána and should not be dependent on the Director of Public Prosecutions in this regard. Without this power, its role will be diminished.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The Minister is opposed to this amendment for the reasons he outlined last Friday during the debate on a similar subject arising from amendment No. 94, which concerned section 60. The Minister stated that, in the context of a criminal proceeding, the role of the ombudsman commission is purely investigatory in nature and that it would be wrong for it to have a prosecution role in addition to its investigatory function in establishing facts. He stated:We are taking away from investigating gardaí the general right to prosecute independently of the DPP. It would be strange to make gardaí second-class citizens in that they alone would be subject to criminal charges without independent intervention and supervision of the DPP.The Minister has no doubt that the representative associations would be very concerned if the DPP's independent, supervisory role were suspended in the case of the Garda Síochána.

In page 63, lines 20 to 26, to delete subsection (4).This amendment is about presentation but it concerns a very important matter. The power of the ombudsman commission to initiate an investigation of its own volition has been crucial. This power is one of the cornerstones of an independent investigative body such as that proposed. Such is its importance that it should be highlighted in a section of its own and not hidden away in another. The scope of the commission's power to investigate a matter should not be limited to circumstances in which a member of the force has behaved badly. It should be open to the commission to investigate policing matters generally.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	582	A similar amendment concerned the Defence Forces ombudsman and it was discussed some weeks ago. The argument we put forward was that the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces should have an open hand in investigating any matter of concern, not just in respect of offences but where there is general public dissatisfaction over a practice within the Defence Forces. To be wholly consistent with the approach we have taken regarding the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, we have outlined in amendment 118 our view that the power to initiate investigations by the commission itself is important. This power should be given to it. I am interested to hear the Minister of State's reply.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I am not so sure about this amendment. It is not so much that I am treading on my dreams but I am treading on somebody else's interpretations of my dreams. The difficulty associated with investigating practices, as proposed, is that it almost establishes the office of the ombudsman commission as an inspectorate. There are two different functions to be considered, namely, that of investigating complaints and that of ascertaining how the whole operation is managed. The two should be separated although it is sometimes difficult to do so. If the ombudsman commission believes a complaint arises from a particular practice or means of dealing with certain circumstances, it is quite free to recommend a change. However, if one simply gives the commission a charter to investigate practices, one could be letting people loose all over the place, or there could be requests for them to be let loose all over the place. This might confuse management. It is the job of management to manage and it should be left to do that job. It should be accounted for in some way other than through the investigation of complaints.

The intention behind them is to extend the current provisions to provide for the ombudsman commission to investigate on its own initiative any matter regarding the activities of the Garda Síochána, particularly policing practices. This is unnecessary because adequate provision is made in section 98 for the commission to examine certain practices, policies and procedures of the Garda. The Minister does not agree with the proposition that the provisions in section 98 do not allow for the ombudsman commission to take the initiative in these matters. Subsection (2) clearly allows the commission to identify any potential problem and to recommend to the Minister that a particular practice, policy or procedure be examined.

In page 65, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:"(2) Protocols adopted pursuant to this section shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.".This amendment provides for publicity and transparency for protocols under section 100.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment. The purpose of section 100 is to ensure that appropriate administrative arrangements are agreed between the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána ombudsman commission on certain important operational activities. The aim is to ensure that the resources of both organisations are used efficiently and effectively and that opportunities for synergy are maximised so investigations can proceed without undue delays. The matters specified in the Bill that are to be made the subject of protocols are operational matters and they are to be agreed exclusively between the Garda Commissioner and the commission.Interagency guidelines and protocols provide a framework within which the work of the relevant agencies can proceed in harmony. The Garda Síochána is party to protocols with other agencies with which it interfaces on a daily basis. Health boards, for example, come to mind. These protocols have not been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not necessary for protocols dealing with operational matters such as these to be laid before the Houses.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	587	Will the Minister of State say whether it would be possible to expect both the Commissioner and the ombudsman commission to indicate in their respective annual reports the existence of inter-force agreements or protocols? In that informal way the purpose of the amendment would be met because there should not be secret agreements. These matters should be in the public domain.

Such an order must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.It might be useful if I set out the background to provisions in Government amendments Nos. 120 to 127, inclusive. The Minister proposes to establish a new Garda Síochána inspectorate in line with the policy behind the Bill to make further and better provision for the Garda Síochána. Use of the word "inspectorate" may cause some confusion because at one time the intention was to establish a body to investigate complaints about the gardaí which was to be called the Garda Síochána inspectorate. This title was preferred over ombudsman because the new body was to have a remit and functions which would be more extensive than those normally associated with an ombudsman type of body. For example, the new body would be made to investigate matters on its own initiative without the need for a prior complaint. It would also have an investigatory and advisory role on Garda practices and procedures which might give rise to public criticism and disaffection.The Minister took the view that too much time and effort was concentrated on the title of the new body so he decided to use the term ombudsman commission instead. This was to reflect the fact that the term ombudsman on its own would generally convey the idea of a one-person operation whereas the Government felt that a three-person body was a better option in this jurisdiction. There are precedents for this approach in other jurisdictions in the context of the usual remit of such bodies, for example, to investigate problems arising from an individual's dissatisfaction with the administrative apparatus of the State.The wheel has come full circle in that an inspectorate is being established but it is a body which is more in keeping with the inspectorate of constabulary in England and Wales. Its functions are quite different from those of the ombudsman commission. The decision to establish the inspectorate originates in the first report of the tribunal established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Morris to inquire into allegations of Garda corruption in Donegal. The Minister is bringing the proposal forward in the light of the tribunal's recommendation that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in line with his statutory oversight role regarding the Garda Síochána, must be empowered by knowledge. The inspectorate's main functions will be to ensure that the Minister has objective information on matters relevant to the functioning of the force consistent with the aims of this Bill to make further and better provisions for the Garda Síochána.The purpose of these amendments is to provide for the setting up of a three-person body, one of whom will be known as the chief inspector. The inspectorate will look at and examine thematic policy issues with standards, practice and performance benchmarked to comparable international policing experiences. The key objective will be to ensure, and promote advice and support for the Minister and the Department. The Minister is confident that the new body will ensure that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day will be better informed on particular aspects of the policing function and will thus be in a position to give up-to-date and accurate information to the Oireachtas as required and in accordance with his or her constitutional and statutory obligations.

Subsection (4) sets out the selection criteria for members of the inspectorate. It covers the appointment of a senior police officer, serving or retired, from outside the State, the intention being that the Government will appoint suitable persons from other common law jurisdictions. Those persons may also fulfil the requirements set out in (4)(b). Similarly, persons from inside or outside the State, other than senior police officers, may also be appointed once they satisfy the relevant criteria. This will facilitate the appointment of suitable persons with law, management, finance, logistics, business etc. experience.Overall, the intention is to give the Government a wide choice in the selection of potential members. As a matter of policy it is for consideration as to whether the first chief inspector should be Irish, particularly in view of the inspectorate's role before an Oireachtas committee. Subsection (5) provides that serving or past members of the Garda Síochána are not eligible for appointment as members of the inspectorate. Subsection (6) provides for the first appointments to the inspectorate to become effective on the establishment day. No provision is made for the appointment of a serving judge to the inspectorate.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I welcome these amendments because they strengthen the Bill significantly. I was confused in the earlier discussions by the confusion between the potential ombudsman and the inspectorate. It is very important that there be an inspectorate but there is a difficulty in having an inspectorate for a single force. Her Majesty's inspectorates in the United Kingdom cover several forces so there is comparability. One of the models which the Minister of State could consider is the implementation commission set up under the Patten report in Northern Ireland which has functioned very well.Does the Minister of State contemplate the inspectorate publishing its report in full or part, which could be helpful in maintaining public confidence in the force? With regard to the appointments, it is absolutely right to have a senior police officer from other forces. No member of the Garda Síochána should be involved but it requires people who have experience of management and so on. As regards the appointment of Irish people, I know a couple of distinguished Irish officers holding senior ranks in other police services and forces around the world who would be very good at this job.

It seems likely that different aspects of the work of the Garda Síochána will be examined from time to time. Some areas will be more complex than others and the time involved to complete inspections will be less in some cases than others. The Government may wish to consider appointing the chief inspector for a longer period than the two inspectors, who may be appointed for their particular expertise in selected areas of the policing function. Subsections (2) to (8) are standard provisions.

In subsection (1), after "appointment" to insert ", being such a period not exceeding 5 years".I recognise the sense in allowing a member of the inspectorate to be reappointed. However, a person should only be eligible for reappointment once. The inspectorate would stagnate and become redundant if the same members were reappointed time after time.

Subsection (1) of the new section 108 to be inserted following acceptance of amendment No. 123, does not specify any definite period of appointment for any inspector so as to give the Government maximum flexibility in this regard. Different aspects of the work of the Garda Síochána will be examined from time to time, and some areas will be more complex than others. Consequently the time involved in completing inspections will vary. In such circumstances, the Government may wish to consider appointing the chief inspector for a longer period than the two inspectors who, as I have already said, may be appointed for their expertise in particular areas of the policing function. Retention of expertise and knowledge will be an important aspect of the inspectorate's work, and I wish to exclude any provision which might cause the unnecessary loss of such to the new body.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I urge the Minister of State to consider the points made by Senator Cummins. Giving people long periods of appointment causes two difficulties. When the inspectorate is being established one must see how it goes and there is much trial and error. One does not wish to tie people's hands. However, a long period in inspectorial office results in what is termed "agency capture". The appointee becomes friendly with the agency, begins to understand it and always accepts its explanations. Also, as retired officers from other forces are to be used, they will apply the knowledge they had when they retired. We must ensure new developments in other police forces across the world are also brought to bear. Without wishing to tie the Minister's hands, it would be worthwhile to consider these points in the future.

In page 67, before section 105, to insert the following new section:109.—(1) The objective of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate is to ensure that the resources available to the Garda Síochána are used so as to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.(2) The functions of the Inspectorate are—(a) in furtherance of its objective to carry out, at the request or with the consent of the Minister, inspections or inquiries in relation to any particular aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána,(b) to submit to the Minister—(i) a report on those inspections or inquiries, and(ii) if required by the Minister, a report on the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána during a specified period and on any significant developments in that regard during that period,and(c) to provide advice to the Minister with regard to best policing practice.(3) Any report prepared under  subsection(2)(b)(i) shall, where appropriate, contain recommendations for any action that the Inspectorate considers necessary.(4) Subject to subsection (4), the Minister shall cause copies of any reports received by him or her under subsection (2)(b) to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.(5) The Minister may exclude from the copies of reports which are to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas any matter which, in his or her opinion—(a) would be prejudicial to the interests of national security, or(b) might facilitate the commission of an offence, prejudice a criminal investigation or jeopardise the safety of any person.(6) The Inspectorate, with the approval of the Minister, may arrange—(a) with any police service outside the State for the engagement of police officers from that service, or(b) with any other body for the engagement of other persons, for the provision of consultancy or advisory services in connection with the performance of its functions.(7) Subject to this Act, the Inspectorate shall be independent in the performance of its functions.".Subsection (1) of the amendment states the objective of the inspectorate. Subsection (2) sets out the functions of the inspectorate, which include the carrying out of inspections or inquiries with regard to any particular aspect of the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána and the submission of reports to the Minister with regard to such inspections or inquiries. Provision is also made for the Minister to request reports on the operation and administration of the force during any specified period on any developments during such period.The inspectorate will be able to conduct inspections and inquiries in two types of situations. The first will be as directed by the Minister. The second will follow consultations with the Minister. This latter provision is designed to allow the inspectorate, on its own initiative, identify an area or areas it considers should be examined. Following discussions with the Minister, he or she will agree an inspection, as recommended by the Inspectorate, should take place.Subsection (3) provides for reports of inspections or inquiries to contain recommendations by the Inspectorate for any action it considers necessary. Subsection (4) requires the Minister to place any reports received from the Inspectorate before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Subsection (5) provides for the Minister to exclude sensitive material in such reports, for example material which could be prejudicial to national security or a criminal investigation, facilitate the commission of an offence or jeopardise the safety of any person.Subsection (6) provides for the inspectorate, with the approval of the Minister, to engage other persons in connection with the performance of its functions. Subsection (7) provides for the independence of the Inspectorate in carrying out its functions. The reference in the first line of subsection (4) should read "to subsection (5),”. A textual amendment will be made on Report Stage.

In subsection (2)(a), after “carry out,” to insert “of its own volition or”.Earlier we discussed the difference between the ombudsman commission and the inspectorate. We believe the inspectorate should have the power to act without first receiving a complaint. When we previously discussed the issue it was said the ombudsman commission could not do it. This amendment suggests the Inspectorate should have the power to act without first receiving a complaint.We are also proposing, in subsection (2), to delete "or with the consent". The inspectorate should not require the consent of the Minister when it decides to take action. It should be an independent body, available to but not a servant of the Minister. With regard subsection (3), the inspectorate should be entitled to make recommendations relating to any matter. This section, as proposed, is severely limited.

I have brought forward the proposal in light of recommendations of the tribunal that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in line with its statutory oversight role with regard to the Garda Síochána, must be empowered by knowledge. The main functions of the inspectorate will be to ensure the Minister and the Department will have objective information on matters relevant to the functioning of the force.I am sympathetic to amendment No. 3 to the amendment. However, I would like to consider the wording between now and Report Stage in consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel.

It achieves this by allowing the Minister, after consultation with the Garda Commissioner and with the approval of the Government, to make appropriate provision by means of regulations under section 106.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	614	Does this section not seem to politicise the Garda Síochána? This section and the amendment proposed to it gives power to the Minister to play a hands-on role in the operation of the Garda Síochána. Subsection (1)(a) provides that the Minister will have a say, after consulting with the Garda Commissioner and the Government, on the different ranks into which the members of the Garda Síochána are to be divided. The Minister will have a say in the admission, appointment and enrolment of members. Subsection (1)(i) provides that the Minister will have a say in the promotion of members.Legislation was recently passed which provides for the Minister to make appointments up to the rank of Commissioner. One could take from a reading of this section and from what the Minister of State said in regard to the amendment that the Minister, after consulting the Garda Commissioner and the Government, can have a say in the promotion of members of the Garda Síochána.Will the Minister of State give us a briefing on this issue? Is that the case? I do not believe anybody would want the Minister of the day irrespective of what party he or she is a member, to have a political say in promotions of members of the force, in the admission, appointment and enrolment of members or of the rank into which the members of the Garda Síochána are to be divided. Will the Minister of State explain this amendment and section?

The intent of this amendment is to ensure greater transparency in Garda promotions. Before changes can be made, the Garda Commissioner must be consulted. The section also covers promotions outside the force. It is to ensure greater transparency in this regard.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	616	It is difficult to see how it will ensure greater transparency because I do not believe the Minister of the day had any say in the promotion of members of the Garda Síochána to the rank of Garda sergeant or superintendent. However, this section and the proposed amendment to it provides that the Minister, after consultation with the Commissioner, could have a say in the promotion of a member of the Garda Síochána at all ranks. If that is the case, we will have to reconsider this section.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	617	That point did occur to me, but I understand the concern expressed by the Senator. A distinction needs to be made between the provision of regulations to enable something to be done and the involvement of a Minister in that activity. There is no suggestion of that, but it would be improper for a Minister of any party to have a say in that process. It may be possible by the introduction of word in the section to the effect that the Minister may in general make regulations, but that it should be made clear that there is no intention to give power to any Minister to interfere in the day-to-day operation of the regulations.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	618	As Senator Maurice Hayes said, it is important that the Minister, who is ultimately accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, would be in a position to make regulations. It does not follow that he or she would decide on the individual promotions within the force.The amendment provides for the setting up of promotion boards consisting of three members, one of whom shall be a member of the Garda Síochána. I had great misgivings about the Local Appointments Commission operating in the public service and particularly at local authority level. It was open to influence and I heard about that in many instances from county managers through their colleagues who were on the various interview panels.There is also the question of promoting a person almost exclusively on the basis of an interview. Some people can perform well at interviews while some can get into a state and not perform well. I have seen many people promoted to positions way out of their depth and, unfortunately, in the public service we are stuck with such people. It is not fair to them because they are not capable of doing the job. They are under pressure and stressed if they are interested. If they are not interested they are just waiting to retire.There is no way promotions would be made in the private sector exclusively on the basis of an interview. The interview would be part of the decision-making process. We need to consider such a process in the public service. The Garda Síochána is such an important arm of the State that it is imperative that people who have the ability to do the job well come through whatever process is there. That process should be transparent and independent, but it should be robust enough to get the right people through.Interview boards can carry political correctness to extremes and the person who shines at the interview is appointed. Subsequently it is discovered that the person should not have been allowed near the post to which he or she has been appointed. This has happened at local government level. Seeing it in black and white regarding the Garda prompts me to make the point. I see other people who have been involved in local government nodding in agreement. It has happened at local government and I have no doubt it happens throughout the public service.

Garda promotions are covered by regulations. The new provision will be the same. The new rules have more to do with the new system of promotion in order to have input into the system by outside professionals. At the moment the system is mainly an internal Garda one. The Minister wishes to introduce greater transparency into the process. That is the intention behind this legislation.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	620	Senator Walsh makes a very good point. The making of appointments under Better Local Government has been a disaster from many points of view. It has divided local authority staff as between people who were promoted and people who were not. People believe the promotions were in no way transparent.Will the promotion boards be set up on an area basis or on a national basis? Will there be a separate promotion board for each rank or one board for the entire membership of the Garda Síochána, given that there are only 10,000 members and I do not know how many promotions? Whatever is done should be transparent because we need a force that works for the betterment of the community. We would not want a force that is divided, as are the staff in many local authorities. We can do without that, particularly in the Garda Síochána. The Minister should tread very carefully regarding the membership of promotion boards, how many there will be and from where their personnel come.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The Minister recently increased the age threshold for entry to the Garda Síochána. I understand that the retirement age is 57 and that gardaí with a minimum of 30 years service are eligible for a full pension. Increasing the threshold for entry means that somebody who has entered the Garda Síochána at 30 years of age will have only 27 years service and will not, therefore, be entitled to the maximum pension. Is it the Minister's intention to waive the extra three or four years? Will the members in question get a reduced pension or will they have the right to buy out the years they need to be eligible for the maximum pension? This would be of concern to people entering the force at an advanced stage in their life.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The Minister is right to change the age threshold. I am sure Senator Burke would agree. Many people suggested that he do so. Whether people continue in the force beyond the age of 57 years would have to be decided on an individual basis. It would depend on the ability of the garda to carry out his or her functions at that age. Some people aged 57 would be in a position to do so, but others would not.Public service pensions, of which we in the Houses are also beneficiaries, could not be bought in the private sector. I am not sure that it should be open to somebody entering the force at the age of 30 or 35 to buy back years. Somebody coming into the force at that age is likely to have already been in employment for ten or 15 years and would have accumulated certain pension benefits which would be taken into account to make up any shortfall in the public service pension.There is an issue and a major black hole regarding public service pensions and pensions generally. The previous Minister for Finance had begun to address the issue. As we go forward it will become a bigger issue. I am not sure we should dig the hole deeper without good reason.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Is there any required level of physical fitness for gardaí? There are some gardaí from whom, even at my age, I could get away in the event of a chase.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I will not respond to the last comment. I appreciate Senator Burke's point. However, I do not have an answer. The Senator will have the opportunity to ask that question of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, on Report Stage.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I appreciate that. The Minister made great play of the fact that he was increasing the age limit and I thoroughly agree with him. However, members of the Garda Síochána must resign on reaching the age of 57. If people who have reached the age of 30 have entered the Garda Síochána and served 27 years, the Minister will have no choice but to let them serve until they are 60 so that they can reach the maximum pension. We cannot deprive people of the maximum pension rights. This issue should be resolved before this Bill is passed because these people are entitled to the maximum pension. We cannot raise the entry age for whatever good reason and allow people into the public service and deprive them of the right to the maximum pension. There is good reason to either raise the age of retirement or make the maximum pension available in whatever way it is possible to do so.

I do not have an answer tonight. I will make the Senator's reservations known to the Minister.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	628	May I take it that the Minister will come back on Report Stage with an explanation regarding the points made by Senator Burke?

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	630	We are quite used to that.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	631	This section deals with security officers. From my reading, it envisages that security officers may be conferred with powers akin to a garda, to which I am opposed. I have stated on other sections of the Bill that only persons who have completed full Garda training should be conferred with Garda powers and that this should be the standard. I oppose powers such as these being conferred on security officers who have not had the proper training. The Minister seems intent in this section on diluting the authority of gardaí.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The Minister was specific and I welcome this positive provision. Given the talk about releasing gardaí for more effective work, this is a positive move. Throughout the public service, value for money is a major issue but gardaí are tied up in these locations which relate to specified State operations. It is appropriate, therefore, that if the Minister in conjunction with these bodies feels that an alternative security system as effective as Garda security can be put in place and that powers can be conferred on the officers involved, it is a step in the right direction.This is the kind of measure for which many Members argued in the House and some went further and stated in regard to traffic enforcement that it could be carried out, for example, by local authority personnel in the same way that rangers operate in the United States. There are other ways of considering these matters. I appreciate that in the case of traffic enforcement the Minister has decided to use gardaí, for which there were probably good reasons. However, in this instance gardaí are standing around in bodies where there might not be a problem for years but which need to be secured because they have important public State functions. It is appropriate that other staff can be recruited by those bodies who would carry out the required security function.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I have concerns with the provision. A major aspect of the Bill is to give people the ability to make a complaint about gardaí. These new powers are given to officers in the locations outlined who are not gardaí. If a person feels his or her rights have been infringed by such officers, what should he or she do? The Bill appears to give substantial powers of search and so on to those designated officers under the section. A person might feel he or she has been wrongly suspected, that the provisions of the section have been wrongly applied or that his or her civil rights have been infringed. In what way does the Bill provide for a grievance procedure?
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I am not suggesting civilians should not do jobs within Garda stations. However, the Minister seems to be moving from designating security officers to a voluntary force. Giving powers to those such as security officers, as they are described in the Bill, is to dilute the status of the Garda Síochána. Reference is made to security officers and a possible voluntary force with Garda powers. We are taking powers from the Garda and giving them to others, a move with which I am not in favour. Such officers should be properly and fully trained, as a garda would be, if they are to attain the powers of a garda.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I agree with Senator Jim Walsh. Many gardaí are tied up through working in locations such as court buildings, and are over-trained for this work. I disagree with Senator Cummins. At a time when more gardaí are needed on the streets doing the work they are trained for, it would be wise to adopt this measure.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The Minister should deal with the point made by Senator Tuffy. I take the point of enabling the officers to do these jobs without tying up gardaí. However, there is the narrow point that if a citizen has a complaint about how they are being handled, to whom does he or she complain?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	637	The positions are static security posts in State buildings. Every such post requires five persons to meet the commitment. We are speaking of specific locations, namely, the Courts Service, a Department of State, the Office of the Attorney General, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the National Gallery of Ireland and the board of the National Museum of Ireland. The Minister is specific in the section that "the person is a suitable person to exercise the powers of a security officer under this section in relation to specified premises [and]... the person has received adequate training for that purpose".Section 114 provides a statutory basis for State bodies to provide their own security. The Minister may designate the bodies listed as authorised bodies for the purposes of the section. Authorised bodies may specify their operational premises and designate named individuals to be security officers for the purpose of that body's property. Security officers in carrying out their duties may exercise any of the powers set out in subsection (4) or subsection (5), but must be identifiable by means of a badge or uniform, and the powers are exercised in accordance with any general or special instruction of the person who designated them. Subsection (4) provides for the powers of security officers. Subsection (5) provides for the additional powers of security officers of the Courts Service when acting on the oral direction of a judge. Subsection (6) provides that unless the court has ordered that a person taken into custody under subsection (5)(b) be committed to prison or be released, the person shall be brought by the security officer concerned, if still in his or her custody, or a member of the Garda Síochána, if already delivered into the custody of gardaí, to the court for it to deal with the matter.A security officer may use reasonable force in carrying out his or her duties under subsections (5) and (6). Subsection (8) provides that powers conferred under this section do not authorise a security officer to require a person to remove clothing other than outer garments or to read any document that would be exempt from production in any court proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege. Subsection (9) provides that this section does not affect any power of arrest conferred by law, including the power conferred under section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997.

Will the Minister consider the extension of the list prior to Report Stage?The Minister referred to the powers of security officers. I presume they have powers of arrest. I think particularly of the National Gallery or the National Museum where there might be nefarious activities. It would be important that the powers of gardaí would be replicated in the security officers within the confines of a particular location. Will the Minister clarify this? While I support the idea, one matter that concerns me somewhat relates to the Courts Service, which involves the District and Circuit Courts. In such places, a Garda presence is often required for the maintenance of law and order.
