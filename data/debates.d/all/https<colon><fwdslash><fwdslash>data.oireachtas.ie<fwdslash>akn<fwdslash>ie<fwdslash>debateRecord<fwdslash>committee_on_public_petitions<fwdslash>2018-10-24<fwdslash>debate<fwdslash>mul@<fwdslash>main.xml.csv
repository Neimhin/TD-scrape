I hope committee members will all do the same. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some matters before resuming in public session. Is that agreed? Agreed.

In one sense, it showed the value of the review both for the orchestras and RTÉ as the parent body and was quite helpful.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-10-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	3	I agree with Deputy Cassells. It was interesting to find out more about the orchestras and what they were doing. We are supportive of them and will try to keep that support going.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16758	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-10-24 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	It was fruitful for the committee to engage with RTÉ on the issue. The orchestras may not have had an outlet within the Oireachtas. It proves the value of the petition received from Ms Joyce, for which I thank her. I thank Senator Horkan for attending.
