The reason I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister and the Minister of State is because I am looking for a formal structure to be put in place for meetings with the HSE. I will give a rough guide of what has been happening to me in Carlow. In August 2016, I requested follow-up on Tír na nÓg respite services. I was told the HSE would come back to me, which it did not. On 29 March I sent an email. I wanted to familiarise myself with the HSE and find out how I could meet the Department. Again, I was to get a response. On 10 April 2017 I received a reply enclosing an information booklet for Oireachtas Members of the Thirty-second Dáil and the Twenty-fifth Seanad, which I had already received on 7 March. As this was not what I had requested, on 15 May I again requested a meeting and provided a list of items I wanted to discuss, but I never heard anything back. On 17 May I got back in touch with the HSE to request meetings. Today, I received a reply with the same booklet. It is constantly sending me the booklet. As I mentioned, this is not what I originally wanted. My colleague on Carlow County Council, Councillor Arthur McDonald, is a representative on the HSE's regional health forum. On three occasions I have requested a meeting with officials but have not heard anything back. Three notices of motion were tabled but I never heard anything back. Several weeks ago, a meeting was held and Councillor McDonald again asked that I meet officials. Again, I heard nothing back. Holy Angels Day Care Centre has also been seeking a meeting but has heard nothing from the Department. Several weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, told me the ambulance service base building was going ahead. We have had no correspondence but it is meant to have started. I want to follow up on this. I also want to follow up on the Tír na nÓg respite service. There are palliative care issues in Laois and Carlow but we know nothing. In December, a proposal on medical cards with regard to youth mental health was submitted to the HSE but nothing has been heard on this. I want to follow up on this. Several months ago, an 82-year-old woman came to my clinic. She had fallen and went to Kilkenny hospital from where she was sent to Waterford because she dislocated her shoulder and Kilkenny does not deal with this sort of injury so that is fair enough.She was there and then she was sent home. The hospital then told her that it could not actually look after her because, ten years ago, when she had private insurance with VHI, she had hurt the same shoulder. She was told then that she did not qualify and that she would have to go back to her private health insurance. She said she was a medical card holder. That lady of 82 years of age was sent home from Kilkenny hospital and Waterford hospital, and told that the matter would be addressed. She was left in pain. I contacted the health board and heard nothing. I then had problem with the dental services. The HSE closed the dental service in Bagenalstown so it means that any school-goers - for example those in primary school in fourth and sixth class - either have to go to Kilkenny or Carlow. I was looking for an update on that, and I believe other HSE services have been cut as well. The other matter I want to address is that I spoke to a lady a few weeks ago who was in a motorised wheelchair. Over the weekend, I could not find anybody to fix her wheelchair because I did not know what Department to go to. There are so many issues there that I need to speak to the HSE about. I need to find the avenues to deal with issues. I know I am not going to get everything sorted but there is a lack of communication and no word back on anything. No matter how many times I request meetings, I am fobbed off. We as Senators, councillors or anyone in our area who represent people need to meet with the HSE on a regular basis. I bring this up today because I am fed up of being fobbed off. I am asking for a solution. When I submitted this matter I got three calls from the health board which I had not received before but I was here in the House and could not take them.

I say at the outset, and I am sure the Senator feels the same as a public representative, that we sometimes find it difficult to get back to people within the right timeframe. However, what the Senator has outlined and the various different events she described are not good enough. As public representatives, we do our best to get back to people. We expect that people we are working with will come back to us in a timely manner. I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to my attention. I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris. Neither I nor the director general of the Health Service Executive were aware of any particular problems in this area. At the outset, I want to say that I speak not just for the Minister, Deputy Harris, but for all of our colleagues at the Department of Health and the director general of the HSE, and that we take our responsibilities relating to the democratic process and to Members of the Oireachtas very seriously. The Department of Health processes approximately 8,000 Parliamentary Questions each year. As a significant number of the questions relate to service matters or are individual queries, the questions are referred to the HSE to provide direct replies to the Deputies or Senators concerned. To ensure that Members of the Oireachtas receive as effective a service as possible the HSE has a dedicated parliamentary affairs division, PAD. This is a national office and is responsible for all communication between the Houses of the Oireachtas, Department of Health and the HSE. The head of the PAD reports directly to the director general. To assist members of the Oireachtas in contacting the HSE, the PAD has a dedicated email address for Members, which I am sure the Senator knows. It is pad@hse.ie. In March of this year, the PAD circulated an information booklet to all members of the Dáil and Seanad that included contact information for all hospital groups and community health organisations, CHO, but perhaps we might discuss that with the Senator later if that has not been any help to her. The PAD also makes every effort to facilitate members of the Oireachtas in obtaining information outside the parliamentary process. For example, in the 12 months to May 2017, there were 28,000 email or phone engagements between Deputies and the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, on national medical card matters. The PCRS has briefed Members of the Oireachtas on several occasions as to how it can cater to requests for information outside the parliamentary system. In addition, there are numerous engagements at CHO, hospital group, constituency and regional forum level. In September 2016, the director general wrote to all national directors, hospital group CEOs and chief officers of community health organisations, asking them to examine how they interact with Oireachtas members and local representatives outside of the parliamentary process, and to look at how current arrangements could be enhanced or improved. On the particular issue that the Senator has raised, I understand that the head of the parliamentary affairs division has spoken to the Senator and has agreed to meet with her to resolve any difficulties she or any other Members on the Oireachtas may have in contacting local HSE officials. I would consider this to be the most appropriate course of action in the first instance and I would be confident that such a meeting will address any concerns the Senator has. If, following that meeting, and in the coming weeks and months, the Senator feels that she is not getting responses and is not getting the level of contact that she needs, I ask that she would come directly back to me or to the Minister, and we will try to address it.

I ask that she go back to the Minister and ask for some kind of structure such that the health board would meet with Deputies and Senators, even if only three times a year, and for there to be numbers that we can get and which are relevant. I understand that everyone is busy. That 82-year old lady was waiting for weeks due to issues relating to private health insurance. I cannot get back to her with news on whether her shoulder has been sorted. Communication and response are crucial here. If nothing else, I ask that the Carlow-Kilkenny section of the HSE come back with replies and meet with us. That is all I ask.

She covers many bases much of the time. I know this is not in her Department's specific remit, but it is good to have her here. I ask if she would be able to endorse the goals of the safe passage campaign and introduce a humanitarian admission programme supported by a community sponsorship scheme, to create a new safe and legal migration route for people fleeing conflict who have a family member living in Ireland already. As the Minister of State knows, we are currently experiencing the largest global humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. Ireland has stepped up to the mark time and time again to help solve global issues in any way we can. People around the country were very proud in 2015 when we promised to welcome 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers by September 2017. So far, we have only accepted 1,238 of the promised 4,000, and I and many others are very disappointed that we are likely to miss the promised target for September of 4,000 people coming into our country. We know that many people already legally resident in Ireland are desperately seeking to bring family members out of conflict zones and have the resources to do so. The safe passage campaign is a scheme proposed and developed by a very fine NGO called Nasc, based in Cork. It would go some way to help us regain some of the last ground. The Nasc scheme would introduce a humanitarian admissions programme for Irish citizens, beneficiaries of international protection and legal residents to apply for family reunification for extended family members fleeing conflict zones, similar to the Syrian humanitarian admission programme, SHAP, introduced for a limited time in 2014. The scheme would also allow members of society to co-sponsor family reunification applications. This can be a citizen, community group, faith-based groups, charity, business or university. The co-sponsor would provide financial, social and institutional backing and thus improve a person's opportunities for integration, easing the financial burden on the host family in Ireland and on Government. The Nasc chief executive, Ms Fiona Finn, said the proposed safe passage scheme would allow people to bypass the terrible use of traffickers and smugglers that particularly affects children coming into the country and the reliance on dangerous boat crossings, providing a safe and legal channel for Syrians to join their loved ones here in Ireland. The scheme would help people like Mr. Amjad Shaaban. Amjad left Syria in 2005, became an EU citizen, and in 2011, he moved to Cork. Earlier this year, Amjad applied for his father and brothers to join him here. Three days after he discovered his application had been refused, his father died of a stroke. His appeal for his brothers to join him was also refused.Amjad said:My two brothers are older, they’re single and don’t have families. I’m capable of hosting them, I have a decent salary plus I own a flat in Cork. I’m contributing to this society and all I ask for in return is a safe place for my brothers. Just consider that we are human beings. Imagine if this happened to your own family. I’ve lost my mother and my father. I only have two brothers, I don’t have anyone else.Why can we not let Amjad welcome his brothers to Cork? There would be a number of benefits to the proposed scheme. It is a pragmatic, cost-effective and an efficient solution that would ensure the safety of those who flee conflict, while also promoting integration and the reuniting of families. Schemes such as this lead to faster, safer and more positive integration opportunities and outcomes. If developed, Ireland will be a leader in promoting humanitarian initiatives to manage the resettlement and relocation crisis in Europe. There are significant international precedents for introducing such a scheme. The proposal is modelled on humanitarian admission programmes and private sponsorship schemes which are working very well in countries such as Canada, Germany and, most recently, the United Kingdom. The proposal was developed in consultation with members of communities which had been impacted on and has the support of the Irish UNHCR office, as well as official endorsement by ActionAid, Barnardos, the Crosscare Migrant Project, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Doras Luimni and ADT Ireland. I call on the Minister of State to listen to the chorus of people calling on us to do more. Will she endorse the safe passage proposal? Will she make it easier for families fleeing conflict to be reunited? Will she ensure we will do more in order that we can come close to meeting our target of welcoming and giving refuge to 4,000 desperate people?

I will read the prepared statement from the Minister's office and then reflect on some of the issues raised by the Senator. I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and creating a further opportunity for us to discuss Ireland's ongoing response to people and their families in need of international protection. The House will recall that in order to reflect the proper response of the people of Ireland to the needs of those fleeing conflict zones, we have responded in a number of strategically important ways to offer our assistance to those most in need. Ireland is one of the few EU countries that has maintained a naval service vessel in the Mediterranean since the beginning of the crisis in order to save lives. We are sending a further vessel this week.  We have committed to guaranteeing funds for food aid for Syrian families under a three-year rolling programme instead of on an annual basis to allow for greater certainty of funding for the World Food Programme. Ireland introduced a Syrian humanitarian admissions programme in 2014 and we continue to facilitate legal migration in a variety of ways through our regular immigration processes, including taking into account humanitarian needs, as appropriate.  We voluntarily opted into the EU relocation programme set up to assist Italy and Greece to respond to the needs of 160,000 people arriving in those countries in need of protection. We have offered protection to up to 4,000 people under the Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP. In meeting our response to this pledge the Tánaiste has doubled our commitment to resettle 520 people by 2017 to 1,040 by the end of this year. We have redoubled our efforts to process approximately 100 people per month from those available and registered in Greece under the relocation programme. We continue to work with all concerned to resolve issues to enable relocation to commence from Italy. To provide the best possible services on arrival in the State, we recently opened our third emergency reception and orientation centre in Ballaghaderreen, alongside Clonea Strand, and in Monasterevin under the Irish refugee protection programme. Under the Irish refugee protection programme, all offers from the community are welcomed and have been assessed and processed by the Irish Red Cross. Both the Tánaiste and I commend the generosity and willingness of people to assist us in integrating those in need of protection. The Government also agreed, following an all-party Dáil motion, to offer protection to unaccompanied minors previously living in the Calais camps who wished to come to Ireland. The Tánaiste is pleased to state every young person who has been identified to date, in consultation with the French authorities, as wanting to come to Ireland has either arrived here or is in the process of doing so. The rights being offered to those under the resettlement and relocation programme or the minors from Calais are significantly superior to those under the previous humanitarian admissions programme. The Government is fully committed to vindicating this higher standard of rights.  The Tánaiste greatly appreciates the spirit behind this discussion and would welcome specific practical proposals from the non-governmental organisation, NGO, sector that would help to progress the Irish refugee protection programme. Despite the merits of the proposal, however, adding further new programmes, while working flat out to fulfil our existing targets, would not be useful or helpful at this time, particularly when there is sufficient capacity still to be filled under the existing programmes. The creation of additional schemes would only lead to a dilution of resources and be counterproductive. Offering protection to people fleeing conflict under the Irish refugee protection programme is the priority. The Tánaiste believes that, by September this year, our efforts will not only have made a difference to a significant number of vulnerable people but will stand up well to scrutiny when compared to those of other countries across Europe. We remain fully committed to reaching the targets agreed under the Irish refugee protection programme.

I welcome the reference in her response to the Syrian humanitarian admissions programme in 2014. The safe passage proposal is modelled on it and asks us to reconsider it in the light of the ever-increasing numbers of desperate people fleeing conflict. It is a practical and sensible proposal which is based on family members living in this country or other citizens who familes have grown up who have spare capacity and spare rooms. People like us are willing to extend the hand of friendship. Rather than diluting existing schemes, as referred to in the proposal, it is adding something, including from family members of persons who are fleeing war. I ask the Minister of State to extend to the Tánaiste, and her officials, an invitation to attend a briefing I am organising on 13 June and follow up on the NASC proposal that will be outlined.

I will not read the other part of the response because it follows on from what has been said. I will raise the Senator's concerns with the Tánaiste. Nobody in this Chamber cannot but be moved by the pictures he or she has seen on television of men, women and children, including the very old, fleeing their homes across the world. It is an awful predicament to be in when one has to leave one's country because of conflict. However, Ireland has done very well in facilitating many people who have come here during the years. The programme in place extends a further opportunity to facilitate them. I understand the Senator's concerns. I hear them in my clinic from people who have been here a long time and want to bring family members here. It is difficult to obtain visas for them. I will raise the Senator's concerns with the Tánaiste and bring the model of the safe passage scheme to her attention in the coming days. I will also mention the briefing to be given on 13 June.

Taim buíoch gur tháinig sí isteach. I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take this matter. I appreciate that it is not her area of responsibility, but it is an important question for those of us who are living in rural areas. I hope I will not receive the standard answer to the effect that this is within the remit of An Post and that the Minister has nothing to do with it. The question is about the protocols agreed between An Post and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the temporary closure of post offices on foot of audit findings. The post office in Carnagh, County Galway, has been closed for a number of weeks. We understand an auditor was sent to it. A number of other auditors appeared on the scene the following day and the post office was closed down. People living in the local community were not given an explanation for what had happened. We are being told it is a contractual issue between the postmistress and An Post, which I can appreciate and it is not an issue. On Monday evening a very large public meeting was held to discuss the issue. We are hearing in the locality that what An Post originally thought was the problem had been exaggerated.It subsequently found out that the issue was not half as serious as it thought, but the post office has remained closed and the audit procedure is ongoing.  I have worked in a partnership company which received funding from Pobal. Anybody who has worked with a company or organisation in receipt of State funding knows that an audit is a regular part of the day-to-day work. One expects audits once every couple of years. When an auditor is coming, organisations get all of the relevant paperwork together. However, inevitably auditors are there to outline what needs to be improved and organisations always receive audit reports that state something is wrong and improvements need to be made.  The question then is how serious are the issues that are being raised. If an audit shows gross negligence or anything like that, one would imagine that an organisation would be closed down. I do not believe that has been proven in this case, but I remain open to clarification. Where there is something like gross negligence, one can imagine a service being closed down. The general procedure is that work goes on while the audit procedure is taking place and the issues that are raised are rectified. This is an issue because the process has closed down a post office in a rural area and people now have to make a 20 mile round trip to a neighbouring post office. Many of those affected by the closure are elderly and do not have transport. There is no public transport to the other service. People have been severely discommoded. The issue involves rural living and the vital role played by the post office service. That is why I want to know the protocol that has been laid down between the Minister and An Post.  Does An Post have to notify the Department that it is going to close a post office? When an audit is carried out, are different levels of misdemeanours, if we can call them, that identified? If a post office goes over a certain threshold, is it then deemed appropriate to close it? Are those criteria laid down? Can we see them? Can the Minister see a role for himself in this and can he engage with An Post on this issue? We have no indication from An Post when the post office will reopen. I am happy to say that it has indicated it does not intend to close the post office in the long term, but people are quite sceptical because we have heard the same about other services. Post offices in other areas have closed. We want the issue to be rectified, the audit is completed, the issues addressed and the post office service reinstated as quickly as possible. I look forward to the response from the Minister of State.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	17	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten. The response may not be what the Senator wants to hear. I will read the written response and I have taken a lot of notes. I will come back to the Senator. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has responsibility for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure that the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post. Day-to-day operational matters, including decisions on the closure of post offices, are matters for the board and the management of the company and not ones in which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has any role or statutory function. Therefore, there is no protocol in place between An Post and the Department governing such matters, which also includes the temporary closure of post offices. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has, however, made inquires with An Post regarding the mailer referred to by the Senator. I have been informed that An Post has advised that the post office in Carna, Galway, was temporarily closed on 3 May due to circumstances beyond its control. While An Post regrets any inconvenience to customers, it is understood that the company is working to restore services at Carna as soon as possible but has indicated that this may take some time. In the interim, the company has indicated that Department of Social Protection customer payments have been transferred to Kilkerrin Post Office. Other services are being provided by other nearby post offices.  I trust that Senator Ó Clochartaigh will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to comment further on any operational matters relating to a specific post office under the remit of An Post. Finally, as far as the operational activities of the company are concerned, I am assured that the board and management of An Post are constantly working to ensure that the services the company provides are developed and delivered to meet the needs of its customers.

Something will have to be done about this. It is sometimes acceptable if a Minister is tied up, but more often than not it is now the case that a line Minister does not come to the House. I am not sure what we are going to do about that but some action will have to be taken. I ask the Minister of State to convey that message to others because I can see a day where we will close down on this issue until such time as some respect is shown for the House, in particular to Senators who raise matters. I will allow the Senator half a minute.

The line I take issue with is not from the Minister of State; rather, it is from An Post which stated that the post office was closed due to circumstances beyond its control. I do not believe it was. It made a decision to close the post office. What was the threshold on which the decision was based? Was there a minor or major discrepancy? A post office should not be closed on a whim. It is a vital public service. We would not close the Houses of the Oireachtas, hospital or medical centre unless something very serious had happened. That may be the case here. I have been told it is not, and I remain to be corrected. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister whether he can put in place a protocol that would show that An Post can only close a post office when certain very serious thresholds have been reached, and under no circumstances should they be closed before then, that an audit process should be undertaken and matters should be rectified. The closure of a post office should be a last resort.

A morning session was introduced to try to enable Ministers to be here. For example, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, is regularly here. When the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, cannot be here he lets people know so that a matter can be withdrawn. It seems as if the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is being rolled out day in and day out as a punishment.

I do not feel coming in here is a punishment. The Senator has raised an issue that is close to my heart. In my area a post office closed recently at short notice, due to a postmaster retiring. Unfortunately, local people, in a similar matter to those to whom the Senator referred, had to change post office. That can be very upsetting for older people, in particular, when they have to travel to another post office. There is an added difficulty when the next post office is a long distance away, which is not the case in the capital city. I take that into account. I will relay the concerns expressed by the Senator to the Minister. It is somewhat unknown for me to agree with many things, but I agree with the Senator that it is very bad when An Post cannot relay, through the Office of the Minister, why a post office is closing. It is a real difficulty across the country. I am not in the camp of the Minister, Deputy Naughten, but I am privileged to represent him here today.

She will be back with us soon. The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, published his annual report this week in which he raised his concern that homeless children and children with disabilities are not being prioritised in the receipt of State services. These children are the most vulnerable and, as such, must be protected most. We learn from the report that a child with intellectual disabilities was left in a hospital for three months because the Health Service Executive, HSE, could not find suitable residential accommodation for him. This depiction recalls the scenes of vulnerable children in orphanages in Chernobyl, but it is the reality in modern Ireland. It is incredible that the State is actively neglecting our children. It sickens me. Further, the report highlighted that many children are placed in inappropriate placements and that the number of complaints about Tusla is most unsatisfactory. Will the Leader ask the Minister to take heed of this report from the Ombudsman for Children and to actively address each of the complaints raised? Yesterday, Mr. Seán FitzPatrick was acquitted of wrongdoing by Judge Aylmer in the Four Courts. The first reaction of many was that this would only happen in Ireland. However, when we dig deeper we learn that there was serious incompetence in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and this was highlighted by the trial judge. It is clear from the judgment that the ODCE did not conduct an impartial and unbiased investigation. It is very worrying and a poor reflection on the ODCE that a judge felt it necessary to highlight publicly the inadequacies in that office. It is very unusual for a judge to do so. The judge essentially said that the office lacked objectivity and criticised the office for shredding documents pertaining to the file, which is extraordinary. The ODCE is the body responsible for policing corporate Ireland and ensuring we have the highest standards of corporate governance. Every person charged with a criminal offence, no matter how unpopular they are, is entitled to a fair investigation by the relevant State authorities. When simple fair procedures are not followed by an agency in its prosecutions it casts doubt over the competence of the agency and is ultimately an embarrassment for the country. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to address the House on this matter and on the efficacy of the ODCE.
#JoanFreeman	unknown-#JoanFreeman-party	unknown-#JoanFreeman-dob	unknown-#JoanFreeman-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	28	I do not know if Members have noticed the headlines over three days relating to the children of our country. I would be interested to know what the visitors to the House think of how this nation treats its children. The first headline stated that a 16 year old child sat overnight in an accident and emergency department waiting to see a consultant psychiatrist. She was suicidal. No psychiatrist turned up so she sat there all night. The second headline stated that ten beds in Linn Dara in Dublin will be closed next month. There are only 22 beds for children who are suicidal or who have other mental health issues and ten of them will now be closed. The third headline related to a hospital in the west, where a suicidal teenager was refused to be seen by the hospital. However, we hear from the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health that everything is rosy in the garden. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to the House to answer the following three questions. How was the budget money spent last year? How does the Department intend to spend the €15 million this year? With regard to the third question, I am continually given the reply that the problem with the mental health services is lack of personnel. What does the Department plan to do in 2017? There is a 50% shortage of psychiatric nurses, doctors and consultants. What is the plan to recruit these people? The Leader should invite the Minister, Deputy Harris, to the House to answer those questions.

I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is coming into the House. Second, I want to raise again the issue of the Mayo campus of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and I commend the action group which has organised a public rally for this Saturday at 3 p.m. in Castlebar. I encourage everyone who cares about the advancement of education in Mayo to attend that rally. It is never too late for the Taoiseach to do the right thing. Before he leaves office, together with his Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, he can secure the future of the Mayo campus in his own town by, first, ring-fencing funding for the campus to support the growth and diversity of courses offered in that campus. He needs to put a stop to cuts at least until the Higher Education Authority, HEA, working group releases its report. He can guarantee full autonomy for the Mayo campus and, in the short term, he can appoint a minimum of four representatives to the GMIT governing body. It is not too late for the Taoiseach to wear the red and green jersey by enabling the Mayo campus to reach its full potential by fully utilising the human capital that is available through the highly-skilled staff in the Mayo campus. I want to say how incensed I am by the bizarre series of calamities that led to the collapse of Seán FitzPatrick's trial yesterday. It is very clear that there has never been the political will to put in place the infrastructure to tackle white collar crime in this country. That is a crime in itself. Reckless lending and corporate corruption cost citizens of this State over €67 billion and it costs citizens almost €7 billion each year just to service this private banking debt that was nationalised. Tom Gilmartin must be spinning in his grave today, and who pays? The Taoiseach-in-waiting said that he wants to represent those who get up early in the morning, those people from Dungarvan to Doohama. What about the citizens who have suffered as a result of the corruption and cronyism of white collar crime in this country, the people who cannot get up early in the morning because they suffer excruciating pain because they are waiting for hospital treatment-----

It seems I cannot initiate the Controlled Drugs and Harm Reduction Bill but it will be presented next Wednesday. I understand I only need the signatures of Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and the Leader to allow that to happen. I had planned to initiate it on the Order of Business and I acknowledge that its introduction will go ahead and that it will be printed. I am holding a briefing on it next Tuesday and some of the international experts in the field of decriminalisation of addiction will be in attendance. I urge any Senators who are unsure of what this Bill entails or what it will mean in an Irish context to attend it themselves rather than only their representatives who work in their offices. I urge the Senators to come along and speak to the four high calibre experts from Ireland and abroad who have been working on decriminalisation of addiction across Europe for many years. It would be great if Senators came into this Chamber fully informed on what this Bill entails next Wednesday when we will have this debate. I would like to second much of what Senator Conway-Walsh said concerning some comments made by our potential next Taoiseach. I find them concerning and they are divisive. I do not make this claim lightly because I do not like attacking people personally but I have a fear that we are moving into a time where we are going to be looking at a Taoiseach who is very classist in his nature. I did not want to have to stand here and say this today but it is the first time in my life that I have felt a little bit of fear about what is coming in terms of our next Taoiseach. I was also close to thinking that I would nearly sign up to Fine Gael just to vote against him and put a No. 1 beside Simon Coveney's name, and that is saying something.

On a more sombre note, as I did not have the opportunity yesterday, I wish to join with colleagues in expressing sincere condolences and sympathies to the families and victims of those caught up in the horrific Manchester bomb attack and to express sympathy also to the people of Manchester at this appalling carnage. It is a new low targeting children in this way. I urge colleagues to sign the book of condolences which the Lord Mayor has opened in Dublin's Mansion House today, and I know many will do that. On a happier note, I join Senator Ardagh in congratulating Senator Clifford-Lee on the great news of the birth of her baby. I ask the Leader for a debate on white collar crime. It requires the Minister for Justice and Equality to come into this House to discuss the serious issues that have arisen following the collapse of the trial of Seán FitzPatrick, about which others have spoken. Looking at the comments of Judge John Aylmer in directing the acquittal yesterday and noting that the Director of Public Prosecutions had already dropped nine of the 27 charges at the close of the prosecution's case, we see some serious issues emerging about the conduct of the prosecution, in particular the conduct of the investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and by its officials. In particular, the judge seems to have focused on the way in which witness statements were prepared. They were prepared as if for a civil trial with numerous drafts to and fro and none of the normal meticulous procedures used that one would have in a criminal trial in terms of witness statements. A number of issues arise. I noted other comments of the judge about lack of impartially by the ODCE and the fact that it seemed to be building a case rather than seeking to investigate impartially. There are a number of different issues. It would require the Minister for Justice and Equality to speak with us on the means of investigating complex matters of white collar crime to ensure that this sort of outcome does not transpire again. I also ask the Leader for a debate on maternity services in light of the HSE's review of maternity cases published this week and also in light of the huge concern many of us have around the governance issues with the move of the national maternity hospital to St. Vincent's Hospital. We are expecting some statement imminently from the Minister for Health on that matter but the review of the cases, particularly in Portlaoise, raise bigger questions also about maternity care in this country and about the treatment of pregnant women and babies in hospitals. I ask for a debate on that in due course.I ask colleagues for their support this evening for the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017. We hope the Government will support it and that there will not have to be a vote on Second Stage. There will be quite a number of people from the trade union movement and the National Women's Council present inside and outside the Chamber to support the passage of the Bill.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	67	I support my colleague, Deputy Ivana Bacik, on the issue of white collar crime. It shows that when the events occurred, we did not have the necessary capacity to deal with them. We now need to ensure such events will not occur again and that we will have people adequately trained in how to prepare such an investigation and how to present the findings to the courts in order that they can be dealt with properly in a fair manner. Deputy Ivana Bacik has raised a very important point. We need the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue and tell us what his future plans are for dealing with it. Do we have sufficient resources provided? Do we have enough trained people? If not, they need to acquire the necessary skills. There is an issue with maternity services going back to 2003 when a report clearly set out the number of medical consultants and specialists needed. There has been very slow development with totally inadequate numbers. In particular, when we go back to what happened in Portlaoise, the number of deliveries had doubled within a very short period, but the HSE did not respond adequately to make sure there were proper staffing levels and the proper number of qualified personnel in place. That is the problem we have in the health service. It fails to respond in a timely manner when things change. It is important to ensure that what occurred there will never be allowed to occur again. Overall, in maternity services, I understand reaching the target, or getting anywhere near it, of having the number of suitably qualified staff and consultants required will take us anything up to ten years as a result of employing ten new consultants per annum. I am not even sure whether that number will be reached this year. The Minister for Health should come to the House to deal with this issue and let us know what the plans are in the next five to ten years in order that we will not have to wait for a new report to come out in 12 months's time on the issue.

Will the Leader use his good offices to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality why it has taken ten years to enforce the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act which allows for the electronic tagging of suspects? It is high time the legislation was enforced. It could be a major resource for the Garda in its ongoing efforts to deal with suspects. It has been widely proved that electronic tagging greatly reduces the number of likely breaches of bail conditions. For this reason, it is difficult to see why ten years have elapsed and we have yet to see the provisions being brought into force. All of us in the House are aware of breaches of bail conditions which in many cases have led to violent assaults being perpetrated on innocent individuals. It is difficult to understand at a time when Garda numbers are being reduced. In the four-year period to 2015, €250 million was spent on providing criminal legal aid. It is high time the legislation was introduced to enable us to provide additional security for the victims in communities who live in fear of crime at all times.

It has issued a warning to Ireland that the property tax take here is too low - at 1%, it is below the EU average of 1.6% - and that the country is too reliant on volatile revenue sources. No wonder people are becoming disconnected from the European Union on a range of issues. I have always strongly opposed the local property tax. One particular party had a slogan a few years ago that it was the wrong tax at the wrong time. It is the wrong tax at any time as it is grossly unfair. My next door neighbour who is widow in receipt of a basic pension pays the same amount in property tax as I do. This is something that needs to come into the light in public debate within days, not months. This is a very appropriate juncture in politics for the issue to be raised by all political groups and none. In its annual economic recommendations the Commission also speaks about the risk of there being some deviations from EU budget rules this year and next. It speaks about issues related to a tax on gasoline and diesel. Given many of the issues on which it touches in the case of Ireland, we should have a debate on the report. Will the Leader arrange for the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss the critical recommendations being circulated by the Commission as they affect Ireland?

Guím chuile ádh orthu. I congratulate Senator Lorraine Clifford Lee and her husband, John, on the birth of their child and hope everything goes well for them. I wish to be associated with the sympathy conveyed to the people of Manchester and the families and friends of all those who were hurt, injured and lost. I was privileged to be at the St. Patrick's Day parade in the city several years ago when I visited the Irish centres. I was born and brought up not too far away from it. What happened there was despicable and our hearts go out to everybody at this very tragic time. I remind Senators that we will have a guest in the AV room today, Mr. Raül Romeva, the Catalan Foreign Minister. He will be there at 4.30 p.m. and I hope some Senators will be able to come and listen to him. He will update us on the political position in Catalonia where, as is happening in many European countries, things are changing very rapidly. The update will be most welcome. Perhaps we might even have a debate at some stage on issues affecting Catalonia. Ba mhaith liom freisin leasú eile a mholadh. I will not second the proposal made earlier as it will be seconded by one of my colleagues. However, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business which I have discussed with the Leader that No. 11 be taken without debate before No. 1. Tá mé ag iarraidh an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 2017 a chur os comhair an Tí inniu. Moltar sa Bhille simplí go leor seo go dtabharfar ar ais an toghchán le haghaidh bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. I mo thuairim, tá easpa oscailteachta agus easpa trédhearcachta in obair an údaráis. Tá géarghá againn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar ról Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir le cruthú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht. Beimid ag súil leis sin a bhogadh ar aghaidh. At some stage in the future we may also have a debate on the role of Údarás na Gaeltachta, the make-up of the board and the role of the organisation in creating employment and keeping Gaeltacht communities vibrant. B'fhéidir go mbeidh an Ceannaire ábalta cuidiú leis an leasú atá curtha chun cinn agam agus leis an díospóireacht amach anseo.

He has claimed credit for the introduction of paternity leave, with which he had nothing to do, and free GP care for the under-sixes, with which again he had nothing to do. I was also flicking through his policy document which I can only assume he put together with his campaign manager, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. There is not one mention of mental health in it. I find it particularly odious that two Dublin private school boys are lecturing the rest of the country on how the poor should behave.I find it particularly odious that this Fine Gael leadership campaign has been paid for in part by the taxpayer. I listened to Deputy Leo Varadkar yesterday talking about this fraud campaign. It is amazing he did not find it within his capability to talk about the fraud perpetrated on the Irish people and the release of Seánie FitzPatrick. I do not remember any other campaign he talked about which was plastered all over Dublin Bus vehicles. I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Lynn Ruane said that if anyone in this Chamber or this country were about to assume the highest office in this land, one would assume that individual would be trying to unite people. However, what Deputy Varadkar and his buddy are doing is trying to create a culture of blame, victimisation and assumption that some people get up and work hard and some people do nothing and some people pay for everything and some people pay for nothing. I suggest we have been through too much over the past ten years - the hurt, cuts, economic collapse, social collapse, emigration and unemployment - to finally come out of that situation and have a celebration last year of our new republic, only to be about to elect to the highest office in the land someone who thinks some people pay for things and other people do not. Deputy Varadkar is running a disgusting campaign. I am disgusted he is about to become leader of this country. I am disgusted he is using taxpayers' money to do it.

I welcome the fact that €17 million has been paid out so far as part of the new help-to-buy scheme. It is a great scheme. As we all know, it is for first-time buyers, whether it be to build one's first house or to buy a new house or apartment, provided one is going to live in the property. It is an excellent scheme. It provides for a refund of one's taxes paid over the previous four tax years. The rebate depends on how much one has worked over the four years and, as we are all aware, €20,000 is the maximum rebate. However, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has said that if he is elected leader of Fine Gael, he will consider getting rid of this new scheme. I have massive concerns about that. It is part of his programme. The €17 million paid out is helping people who do not qualify to be placed on the local authority housing list and who are trying to get on in life and better themselves. I, therefore, ask the Leader to go back to the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and ask him not to get rid of the scheme. I have just been at a meeting about disability. It is sad to think that people with a disability in the survey done in February have been suffering more over the past few years and are now further in poverty. I will also have to address this with the Minister.

I wish to raise the issue of the history of the State's dealing with white collar crime. It is quite shocking. There were 289 Ansbacher cases and no one prosecuted and there were 3,675 DIRT bogus accounts and no one prosecuted. In regard to the HSBC scandal, 350 Irish persons held accounts amounting to €3.1 billion in Geneva bank accounts but nothing happened. It is worth considering the words of Remy Farrell, who, as the House will be aware, is a senior counsel who often prosecutes cases for the State. He spoke out about what was going on, namely, that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation was absolutely swamped a number of years back, leading to just one in ten cases it was examining coming to prosecution. Ian Drennan of the ODCE spoke out and said there was just one forensic accountant working for the ODCE, and we wonder how our State came to collapse. It collapsed because of a lack of regulation and accountability. When will this Government get to grips with this? I was reading back over my contributions when I was justice spokesperson for Sinn Féin. In 2012 and 2013, I raised the issue of amalgamating all the various agencies - the ODCE, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Central Bank, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Revenue - so they would come together under one management to oversee the issue of white-collar crime and the State that was brought economically to its knees. This is the seriousness of this. It is not just about Seánie Fitz yesterday; people are watching a whole procession of these people walking away, getting away scot-free because of a failure to put in place a proper system. I urge the Leader to contact the Minister for Justice and Equality and ask her to come to the House to present on provisions for tackling white-collar crime so we can debate her vision and argue it through. Finally, we need a meeting on Jadotville. The Leader knows I have held back a motion on this issue for some time. I ask that he and the Minister meet with me and Senator Craughwell and get this sorted out.

I do not like people's names being mentioned. To my knowledge, Mr. FitzPatrick was cleared of any wrongdoing, whatever the Senator's views on the matter. It would be wrong to impute guilt to him because the courts have cleared him. Senators should be very careful naming names because someday it will backfire on one or other of us. I call Senator Rónán Mullen.

Farmers have been making the best of this weather by spreading slurry and doing all sorts of cutting and other general maintenance on their land. However, some are waking up to find that their machinery, equipment or livestock have been stolen from their yards or fields while they slept. Official figures indicate that burglaries on farmland fell 14% in 2016 on the corresponding figure for 2015, but each week that passes this year there are news reports of farmers being robbed of their possessions. In the past few months, tractors have been stolen from yards across the country, cattle and sheep rustled and vehicles and tools taken. In one week recently, the Irish Farmers' Journal reported that a quad bike and trailer were taken from a dairy farmer in County Waterford and that four miniature ponies worth €4,000 were stolen from fields in County Leitrim. On St. Patrick's Day, a tractor worth about €30,000 was taken from a farm in County Carlow at 7.30 p.m. It has been claimed that drones are being used to spy on farms, some of which are very easy targets if they are located near good road networks. This is why I would like the Minister to come to the House and outline what measures she is taking to protect farmers and what her Department is doing to prevent such crime from taking place in the first place. The closure of rural Garda stations has been very difficult for communities around Ireland, as we all know, and has increased the fears of those living on farms or in rural parishes.Last August, we had a major awareness campaign from the Garda Síochána, the Irish Farmers' Association, DoneDeal and Crimestoppers to halt thefts on farms but crimes against farmers, as I have been saying, continue to happen on a frequent basis. Of course, some farmers are potentially losing more money by offering cash rewards of thousands of euros in order to get their means of production back, while others are forced to pay higher premiums for insurance. That is the context in which it would be important that the Minister would come before the House.

This is not merely right-wing politics. This is far-right politics. I would remind the House that the right to strike is a fundamental human right. It is recognised as such. It is a right of self-defence. To hear both prospective leaders declare that they intend to curtail the right to strike for public sector workers can only be describe as sinister. Such a proposal would also undermine the industrial relations machinery. It is a disgraceful proposal. It would mean that the State could use Labour Court recommendations that suit the employers and make them enforceable while ignoring recommendations that do not suit the employers. In this regard, I remind the Leader that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, is currently ignoring a host of Labour Court recommendations, and I have written to the Leader in regard to that. That shows the Minister, Deputy Varadkar's level of respect for trade unions. As someone who likes to brandish his trade union credentials, I would like to hear the Leader clearly condemn these ideas of curtailing the right to strike. Now that we have the prospect of two Deputies on the far right of Fine Gael vying for leadership, I would say to my colleagues in Fianna Fáil that to facilitate the election of one Fine Gael Taoiseach is unfortunate but to facilitate the election of two is careless.

For clarity on the issue, I refer to a letter written by Colm Tóibín to the Arts Council in which the artist makes clear that the letter is for public consumption and is not confidential. Colm Tóibín states, "I notice that the council wishes to change the definition for those artists eligible for cnuas". He goes on to state:The Arts Council discussed the definition of 'full-time practising artist'. It was agreed to no longer use this definition. The new definition for eligible artists is 'working artists engaged in productive practice'.He then, with great honesty, states:While I am not seeking a cnuas, and never have sought one, I presume I am a working artist, but I have not written a single word since last November. I can't think of anything. Sentences won't come. I can't force them. I don't know when I will start writing again. I do nothing most of the time. I am waiting. That is what artists do sometimes. This may be necessary. In time, I hope to get an opening paragraph, but who knows? In any case, I am not involved just now in productive practice - whatever that is (I suppose it means writing).Colm Tóibín asks the Arts Council: Have you seen the work the Agnes Martin produced in her nineties? Have you studied that long period in her life, when she was old, when she made no paintings at all, a period of inwardness and reflection that may have been essential for her and may have made all the difference to the work she then produced in the years before she died.He goes on to quote the Arts Council who, "agreed that members not advanced in years but who are temporarily incapacitated due to ill health and unable to engage in 'productive practice' during the course of a cnuas five year term would have their cnuas suspended and would not be eligible to seek financial assistance via alternative measures". To the Arts Council, he draws, and I quote from him, "attention also to Patrick Kavanagh's poem 'The Hospital', which is one of the greatest Irish poems of the second half of the twentieth century. The images came to him while he was being treated for lung cancer". He than asks: Would you really have written to him when he was stricken so, to let him know what the Arts Council had agreed? You need to remember that there have been many Directors of the Council, and there are, as you know, many ex-Directors, and many ex-Chairs, ... And this is the way it should be. But there are no ex-artists. There never have been. That is not how the imagination works. We are often silent, and indeed we may often seem to be indolent. But we don't retire.It was also agreed by the Arts Council to produce audits of the work undertaken annually and Colm Tóibín wonders and asks whether if John McGahern, who published no novel between 1979 and 1990, had been in receipt of a cnuas, would the Arts Council "have sent 'auditors' down to Leitrim to do 'a sample audit' of what he was doing?", and whereas James Joyce produced no work between 1922 and 1939, would they have asked for sample "drafts of 'Finnegans Wake'?"

In a response, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has adopted a hands-off approach to this.

I am asking for Deputy Heather Humphreys to address this House on Aosdána.

I join the Cathaoirleach and all Members in welcoming Dr. Omar Shuayb, the trade and investment Minister from Somaliland, to the Chamber. I join all of my colleagues in sending congratulations to our colleague and friend, Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee and her husband, John, on the birth of Edward, and wish them every happiness and joy. Certainly, from looking at the photographs on social media, Edward is surrounded by love. We wish all the family a happy and enjoyable few days before sleep deprivation kicks in. It is a day of celebration. The majority of Senators this morning have raised the overarching issue of white collar crime. Senators Ardagh, Bacik, Conway-Walsh, Colm Burke and Mac Lochlainn all raised the issue, in particular the issue of the decision in the courts yesterday regarding the trial of Mr. Seán FitzPatrick. The matter is also before the court today as well and, as the Cathaoirleach rightly stated, we all should be cognisant of our remarks. It is important we recognise that there is disappointment and dismay at the decision announced yesterday, irrespective of one's viewpoint. I certainly share Senator Mac Lochlainn's view in terms of the litany of reports and events, and the lack of prosecution for whatever reason. It is bewildering that we have this type of outcome when perhaps there is an outcome that we all think differently about, but the courts are independent of us all. There is a need to address the issue of white collar crime. As a first step, I have asked the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to come to the House because the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement falls under her remit. From a perusal of the remarks yesterday - I have not gone into them in detail - what happened is disappointing. There are serious questions to be answered regarding the manner in which this trial was approached. From what the Senators, particularly Senator Ardagh, have stated, there is a right to fairness and a right to a presumption of innocence, but there is also a right to expect things are done properly and that seems to be missing in this. It is bewildering to the citizen outside who is watching from afar who expects those charged with responsibility to do their job properly. Certainly, the conduct of the case looks to have been poor. It looks to have been badly handled. Those issues must be addressed and I have asked the Minister to come to the House. The Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has asked the director of the ODCE for a full report, including on the role of all professionals in the case. That needs to be examined and there needs to be outcomes from that. It is no longer good enough to say we must learn lessons. I fully agree with Senator Mac Lochlainn that the lessons have not been learnt. There is a litany of instances in which there has been a lack of prosecutions that we need to see addressed.Although I do not want to stray offside, it is upsetting when one sees the people of one's country collectively paying a price and nobody being held to account. As politicians, we have all been held to account for the stewardship in government. We fall or are re-elected, but there is nobody being held to account at another level, which is appalling. It is absolutely appalling that nobody is being held to account in spheres other than the political sphere. The Minister has said she will examine the report and review the judgment when it is available from the court. The issue of resources was raised. Since the Minister took office, she has increased the resources for the office. They include five forensic accountants. There has also been the recruitment of digital forensic specialists. Senator Catherine Ardagh referred to the report of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon. In my former role as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I always found Dr. Muldoon to be a person of extraordinary probity, who in his role was very much focused on achieving positive outcomes. He is very clear in his annual report and makes very valuable contributions through being available to the Oireachtas committee and giving advice to the Government. He raises issues of importance that have an impact on the lives of children and their families. His report is one that we need to examine in its totality. Certainly, the issues raised by Senator Catherine Ardagh need to be addressed. It is important to recognise, however, that this and the previous Government have been committed to protecting children's rights. The previous Government set up a full Department of Children and Youth Affairs. We also had a referendum on children's rights. The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, was created. We launched strategies on the role and rights of the child. The introductory remarks made by Dr. Muldoon in his report are worth examining as they reflect the range of sectors in which the Government has had an impact on the most vulnerable. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is committed, with the Ombudsman for Children, to ensuring the protection of the rights of the child and greater investment. I am a great proponent of early intervention and the need to intervene early through the early years strategy. Senator Joan Freeman referred to Linn Dara and raised the matter of treating a 16 year old in an emergency department. Any of us who understands the significance of her remarks recognises that there should be no child of that age in need of psychiatric care in an emergency department at any time. The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, the line Minister with responsibility for mental health services, is prepared to work with all people, political parties and Independents to ensure the issue is prioritised. We will not be bringing the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to the House but the Minister of State. As the Senator knows well, the HSE administers the Vote, the funding for mental health services. As I stated yesterday on the Order of Business, we all accept that there is a need for increased funding for mental health services. The Government has already provided for such an increase. There are posts being created and additional moneys being made available. The Senator should sit down with the Minister of State and those involved in the cross-party group on mental health to ensure positive outcomes are achieved. With regard to Linn Dara, which was referred to yesterday and again today by Senator Joan Freeman on the Order of Business, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, visited the facility yesterday. Nobody is being discharged to allow a bed to be closed. That is the first point we should make. The HSE is working to increase the capacity of child and adolescent mental health services. In the case of Linn Dara, the core issue relates specifically to the difficulties being encountered in the recruitment of mental health professionals. Therefore, it is not a matter of funding availability but about staff recruitment. From my conversation with the Minister of State this morning prior to the taking of Commencement matters, I learned that she was determined to have the matter resolved and that no child would be turned away and no bed closed on the basis of what some were alleging. I will not be accepting Senator Rose Conway-Walsh's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. She referred to GMIT.

Like his Government colleagues, he is committed to multi-campus provision in the case of all institutes of technology but particularly GMIT. As I stated before to Senators Colm Burke, Rose Conway-Walsh, John O'Mahony, Michelle Mulherin and Keith Swanick who have raised the matter, it is important that all Mayo public representatives, irrespective of their political persuasion, work together to ensure GMIT will be back on a secure, sound financial footing and as a campus offering courses and places to students. That is why the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, has visited the campus and set up the working group. That is also why he has guaranteed a bright future for GMIT. As Senators know, the working group has met the students and staff and is working to ensure a positive outcome for everybody. As I said before, when the working group reports and we have the debate, Senators will see there that is a positive future for GMIT. I share their view that it should have a positive future. I will be very happy to allow Senator Lynn Ruane's Private Members' business item to be taken next week. As she knows, the role of the Leader of the Seanad is not connected to that of the Bills Office. There will not be a refusal or reluctance on the Government side of the House to take the Private Members' Bill. I hope that, with the intercession of the Cathaoirleach and, perhaps, the Clerk of the Seanad, we can reach an accommodation to allow that to happen. I will not be blocking the taking of the Private Members' Bill next week. I do not know how to answer Senators on the Fine Gael leadership election. Many Senators, including Senators Lynn Ruane, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, Máire Devine and Paul Gavin, mentioned it. It is great to have another debate about Fine Gael in the Seanad. It is good that the Senators are talking about us because Fine Gael is the largest political organisation in the country.

If I am unable to go to the Senator's meeting today I will certainly pass on his views after today's audiovisual room presentation. I thank him for doing that. I know some of my colleagues opposite think that I am always criticising but it is important that people like Senator Ó Clochartaigh get credit for the work they do in promoting human rights and in raising different viewpoints from different sides of political arguments across the world. My views would not be too dissimilar to the Senator's on some things, but on other things they are. I commend him for that.

Neither of the Fine Gael leadership candidates is spending public money on their campaigns. Senator Ó Ríordáin's remarks are mischievous, misleading and should certainly be clarified because the Minister is not expending any public moneys on any campaign. Social welfare fraud is a different issue. All of us recognise that we need to address all issues in this area, whether they relate to white collar crime, social welfare fraud or whatever. We commend the Revenue Commissioners when they publish a list of tax defaulters and pursue them. Equally, those who abuse the State's social welfare programmes should not be allowed to get away with it. I do not know whether the Senator disagrees. I am not seeking his endorsement, but that is a fact of life. I was not quite sure what Senator Devine was seeking, to be honest. I am not being disingenuous, mischievous or trying to provoke her politically but I did not know what she was looking for in her contribution. If she wishes to tell me afterwards I will endeavour to talk to her.

I certainly think that we should be incentivising and helping people to get on the property ladder, in this case first-time buyers. To address Senator Mac Lochlainn's contribution, I have spoken to Senator McFadden about Jadotville and I have also met with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, in that regard. The Senator might not think we are trying to progress the matter but we actually are. I share the Senator's view on this, as he knows quite well. I am trying, as Leader of the House, to arrive at a positive conclusion for everybody. If the Senator can give me a bit more patience, I will be happy to try to get him a meeting with the Minister of State on that issue. To be fair to Senators McFadden, Craughwell and Senator Mac Lochlainn himself, we need a commonality and unity of approach in order to see this matter resolved positively for the families and the men who served, in particular.

I am being genuine in that. Senator Mullen raised the very important issue of farm thefts and the need for vigilance and proactivity in rural Ireland. I certainly agree with him. We have seen a decline in burglary across the country. I have not got the figures to which the Senator referred, but it is worrying that we have seen an increase in theft at this time of the year. I was travelling to Cavan last night for a particular event and I was struck by the amount of activity in rural Ireland. The Senator made his point well. I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.

As somebody who was a member of a union, I recognise the importance of the right to strike. Equally, we need to have a debate about making resolutions of the Labour Court binding.

Senator Warfield raised the issue of the importance of the Arts Council of Ireland. I did not know that this matter of the productivity of artists was being put forward. The Senator's presentation of the Colm Tóibín piece was a very good example of members of the arts community going through fallow phases, if that is the right phrase to use. It certainly poses a good question in terms of productivity and what a positive and productive outcome is. That is something that we need to look at and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard. I will take Senator Ó Clochartaigh's amendment and I would be happy to take Senator Ruane's Bill next week, but I will not be accepting the other amendments.

I know this is a matter close to every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas and to the people in general. I am very glad of the opportunity to speak on the important issue this afternoon. I want to use this opportunity to acknowledge the service of the men and women of the Irish Defence Forces and to outline the Government's commitment to investing in the Defence Forces. We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to those who serve in the Defence Forces, both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the State. I take this opportunity to recognise their patriotic service and the enormous contribution that members of the Defence Forces have made and, to this day, continue to make to peacekeeping duties. For close to 60 years, the Defence Forces have played a vital role as peacekeepers all over the world in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The Defence Forces' 66,000 individual tours of duty in UN and UN-mandated peace support missions to date is a tangible demonstration of this country’s commitment to the pursuit of international peace and security. Today, more than 600 members of the Permanent Defence Force are serving overseas in various parts of the world, which reflects the Government’s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of peacekeeping. Defence policy and the resourcing and implementation of that policy are grounded on the realistic and ongoing assessment of the defence and security environment, including domestic and international factors. Conflict and tensions in eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and elsewhere will continue to challenge international peace and security. Following a period of apparent stability, new and serious conflicts have erupted adjacent to the EU, which have challenged perceptions about the stability of the broader European region. The suddenness of recent crises has once again highlighted the unpredictability of the security environment, reigniting concerns that have not been seen since the end of the Cold War. The threat to Ireland as a target of international terrorism remains under constant review, taking into account developing security threats, including identified common risks that arise for western democracies generally. At this point, I want to acknowledge the loss of life in the terrorist attack in Manchester earlier this week, and convey my own personal sympathies and those of the Government to those affected. In common with its European partners, Ireland is particularly concerned by the risk posed by persons travelling to certain conflict zones and the potential threat when they return. There is also concern regarding the process of radicalisation and there are a range of influences, including the internet, which can enable this process. It is a fact that any potential conflicts affecting member states of the EU present serious concerns for Ireland and the future outlook is likely to remain unpredictable in the coming years. The White Paper on Defence, approved by Government in July 2015, provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the next decade. This policy framework is flexible and responsive, given the dynamic nature of the security environment and enables the defence organisation to be adaptive to changing circumstances and to use resources as effectively as possible. I want to state clearly that this Government is committed to supporting the men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann. They serve our country, at home and abroad, with great distinction. In the budget for 2017, I secured an extra €16 million for defence. This provides enough resources to pay for the Defence Forces at a full strength of 9,500. It is an extra €7 million for capital spending, bringing the capital allocation up to €74 million, a 10% increase. It also includes an extra €6 million for pensions. It is not just the men and women of the Defence Forces that we are investing in. We are also investing in the equipment and platforms that they have available so that they can carry out their duties in an effective and safe manner. The Naval Service ships replacement programme has delivered three new offshore patrol vessels. Last year, the Government signed a contract for a fourth new vessel which will be delivered in mid-2018. When complete, the total contract value for the four ships will be close to €270 million. We are also investing in the Air Corps, with plans in place to buy new aircraft. A replacement Pilatus aircraft will be delivered this year at a cost of €5 million plus VAT. The White Paper provides that the Cessna fleet is to be replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance tasks. On 4 May last, the Department initiated a tender competition when it advertised the specifications for the new aircraft. The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the Air Corps’ two CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger, more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo-carrying tasks. Earlier this year, I was delighted to award a €50 million contract for a maintenance and upgrade programme for the Army’s current fleet of 80 armoured personnel carriers, APCs, which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet to 2030. A number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles are also being procured for the purposes of enhancing force protection. This will cost in the region of €5 million. Capital funding is leading to the construction of significant work across barracks, including works in Baldonnel, the Curragh, Haulbowline, Kilkenny, Limerick, and in Dublin, in Cathal Brugha and McKee Barracks, and also in the equitation school. The approach to manpower development of the Defence Forces is guided by the operational requirements of each of the three services.Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation at home and abroad. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. All efforts are currently being directed at recruitment in order to return the Defence Forces to their approved establishment.  In order to ameliorate the challenges associated with the turnover of personnel, a continuous yearly recruitment drive is operated by the Defence Forces and 590 general service recruits were inducted in 2016, along with 100 cadets between all services. Regular competitions are held for the recruitment of enlisted personnel, cadets and other staff, and remained in place during 2011 which was the worst recession in the State. General service and cadetship competitions were launched earlier this year and a total of 5,209 general service applications and 3,466 cadet applications have been received. Cadet and general service recruitment campaigns are currently active, with historically high levels of recruitment being pursued. The Defence Forces are planning for the induction of up to 900 new entrants in 2017. That will include 100 new cadets in September this year. Promotions are ongoing within the officer ranks in order to fill rank vacancies. In addition, a new NCO promotion competition to fill vacancies to the rank of sergeant and above has been launched. Promotions from the order of merit lists from this competition will commence in the third quarter of 2017. It is my intention that promotions will continue to be carried out within the resource envelope allocated to defence. Retention of specialised personnel, such as pilots and air traffic control, ATC, personnel in the Air Corps, is a significant challenge in light of the demands arising for such skills in a growing economy. Air Corps personnel are an attractive employment source for other airlines and air service providers given their experience and training. Every effort is being made to address the current shortages in personnel faced by the Air Corps.  Following the Air Corps apprenticeship competition which was held earlier this year, it is planned that 25 new Air Corps apprentices will be inducted in late September 2017 to commence their training. Actions are also under way to return to a full level of ATC services by the Air Corps which will facilitate a gradual extension of operational hours for ATC services in Baldonnel over the year as newly qualified personnel develop their experience. In terms of remuneration, pay and conditions of employment in the Defence Force are set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various sectors of the Irish public sector. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 to 2015 and the Lansdowne Road agreement currently define the pay policy for public servants, to which PDFORRA and RACO have signed up. As Senators will be aware, the pay commission report was published on 9 May last and contains a very comprehensive and detailed analysis of pay and pensions issues in the public sector. Notably, it addresses issues surrounding recruitment and retention in the Irish Defence Forces. Indeed, it should be noted that my Department made a detailed submission to the Commission setting out these very matters and this is specifically referenced by the commission in paragraph 6.13 of its report. This was done under my direction. In the context of the commencement earlier this week of pay negotiations, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment in this regard. I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, about this matter. I want to assure the House that significant work is under way in the defence organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps. The chief of staff has spoken directly to me about pay and conditions and the challenges he is facing, about which he hears from his members. Recruitment of new personnel is also taking place. Currently there are 27 cadets, in three classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots. A return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps will be a gradual process as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become pilots. Actions are also under way to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps. Air traffic control training is taking place and options to ensure the long-term sustainability of ATC services in Baldonnel are being identified. Some personnel are nearing completion of their training and a new class has recently been inducted. The Defence Forces take pride in being able to respond to requests for assistance, but it has to be borne in mind that capabilities are not specifically developed to support other agencies and for civil contingencies but, of course, their utilisation for such tasks maximises the utility of defence capabilities overall and value for money for the State. There are two issues that some Senators have raised recently, and I would like to address these in my opening statement. First is the reorganisation of the Defence Forces. This was done on the joint advice of the then Chief of Staff and Secretary General of the Department of Defence in the 2012 reorganisation of the Defence Forces. It was designed to maximise operational capacity and provide for an organisation that is flexible and can accommodate new or unexpected demands. It replaced the existing under-strength units with a smaller number of full strength units, achieved a reduction in the number of headquarters and brought about the associated redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units. As a result of the reorganisation, there are now more troops stationed in barracks along the west coast. There are now more personnel stationed in Donegal, Galway and Limerick. However, I recognise that there have been issues and challenges regarding personnel travelling between barracks. That is something that I and the military authorities are working to minimise. I spoke directly to the Chief of Staff about this issue on a number of occasions, including as recently as yesterday.  The second matter is that of the new position of assistant secretary general in the Department of Defence, something for which I have advocated for quite some time. In light of the major programme of policy implementation and to ensure best practice in corporate governance, sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an additional management board post at assistant secretary level. Working in close collaboration with military colleagues, this post will specifically increase the focus on personnel issues in defence, ensuring that we have in place a military and civilian workforce that best delivers defence outputs in accordance with assigned roles and responsibilities. The cost of the appointment is being met from within the Department’s existing resource envelope. My Department and the Defence Forces also have responsibility for two valuable organisations that depend on volunteers, namely, the Reserve Defence Force and the Civil Defence, something I would like to go into but I am under time constraints. Both are excellent organisations that provide supports to their local communities. We have all seen the benefits of the work of both groups, and for that I highly commend them. Regarding Brexit, I want to state that it does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces' operations or for Ireland’s continuing engagement within the EU common security and defence policy, CSDP. The outcome from the negotiation process will be considered in the context of existing structures and relationships to ensure that the Defence Forces continue to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government. I assure Senators that the Government is committed to funding the Defence Forces and equipping them to do their duties safely and effectively. That is why we are investing money, engaging with other countries on an international basis and continuing to recruit to the Defence Forces, even in the most difficult of times. The White Paper provides the framework from which we will continue to develop and enhance our Defence Forces over the next decade. There are many other issues I could address but, unfortunately, I only have 15 minutes for my opening statement. If Members wish to raise other issues with me, I will do my best to address them. If I do not have the answers with me I will communicate directly with the Senators.

Ba mhaith liom fosta fáilte mhór a chur roimh na daoine ó PDFORRA agus na clanna atá i láthair. I welcome the Minister of State. I also extend a warm welcome to the members of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and their families in the Visitors Gallery. Irish people take great pride in the Defence Forces and in the contribution made by the Permanent Defence Force, the Reserve Defence Force and Civil Defence. We all agree that the single greatest asset the Defence Forces have is its personnel, yet the Defence Forces are facing huge difficulty in retaining and recruiting sufficient personnel. They are now seriously below strength and it is time to rebuild them significantly. The decline over recent years has left the Defence Forces with just 9,070 personnel, 430 below the current agreed strength. Even though a new recruitment campaign was launched in 2016, in the year to last February the number in the Defence Forces fell from 9,146 to the current number. The ongoing exit from the Defence Forces at all ranks is running at between 40 and 50 per month, a startling number. Given the horrendous actions across the pond in the UK and the real threat of terrorism, Ireland must recommit to the Defence Forces and its defence capability. Fianna Fáil believes we should seek to increase the Defence Forces strength to 10,500 in the coming year. We also believe it is important to retain the number we already have. Since 1992 the Defence Forces have gone through eight re-organisational reviews, an average of one every three years. It is little wonder that the Defence Forces are recognised as being to the forefront in public service transformation. However, there is a significant downside to this. The Defence Forces have been the scapegoat for the Government, the easy option where it can make cuts. This has resulted in turmoil, relocation, uncertainty and confusion for all members of the Defence Forces and their families. Such tension and family displacement are not conducive to optimal operational viability and certainly not to good morale. Figures provided to Fianna Fáil last month show there are now just 817 Army officers in the Defence Forces, a fall from 966 officers in 2002. It is a drop of more than 15%. There has been widespread concern in recent years about the depletion of the officer ranks and it is clear from the figures that the situation is becoming extremely serious. If the exodus continues and the issues continue to be ignored, there could be a serious impact on the operating capabilities of the Defence Forces. It has been reported that last year 75 officers left early, a rate that is simply unsustainable. Representative organisations say they have attempted to engage with the management to have their concerns addressed but, unfortunately, with little success. It is not just the Army that has experienced a drop in the number of officers. The Naval Service is down 7.5% and Air Corps personnel has fallen by 13.5%. It is essential that steps are taken to address the attrition rate in the Defence Forces and the loss of many highly-qualified, trained and skilled officers. With the continuing fall in the numbers in the Permanent Defence Force, Fianna Fáil has consistently highlighted the grave concern that the departure of so many personnel could affect Defence Forces' operations and capabilities. I have had many conversations with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, which has warned that the military is critically short of specialised officers, including pilots, aeronautical engineers and bomb disposal experts, and that a contributing factor to this brain drain has been the Department of Defence's refusal to honour conditions of service, such as previously agreed career promotional terms. The association said that this led many officers to quit as they saw no future for career development in the Defence Forces. The bomb disposal service is at half of its officer strength. The Air Corps has been significantly short staffed in the aeronautical engineering department and has only 70% of the pilots it requires. It is estimated that 25% of senior Air Corps pilot posts remain unfilled due to the absence of suitably-qualified and experienced candidates. With known retirements this will soon increase to 38%. This starkly came to the fore following the awful tragedy off the coast of Mayo a short time ago. The Air Corps was not in a position to assist due to staffing difficulties. According to the general secretary of RACO, Commandant Earnan Naughton, the continual loss of organisational corporate memory and specialised knowledge requires immediate attention. He said that the investment required to deliver complex military capabilities requires human expertise to meet the broad spectrum of an increasingly technologically driven security environment. The results of the Defence Forces climate survey undertaken in 2015 and published last year broadly found that personnel had become less happy with their work situation over the intervening years. While many of the respondents from all ranks said they still enjoy their work, there is a perception of a lack of justice and low morale in the organisation. Just under half of the respondents were unhappy with their career progression prospects and opportunities for promotion. There is an evident disconnect between what employees expect and how their expectations are met in many areas of pay and promotion. Almost 70% felt loyal to the Defence Forces and their values. Just 23% of members felt obliged not to look for work elsewhere. In transfers to other geographical areas some 30% felt obliged to move as requested. Fianna Fáil believes the Defence Forces are of critical importance to both the State and society. Sadly, it has not always been clear that the Governments since 2001 have valued the defence organisations sufficiently. The decision in March 2011 to assign the defence portfolio as a subsidiary role to the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated a lack of respect for the portfolio. While it was not unreasonable to assign it with another Cabinet portfolio, to do so with the justice and equality portfolio, one of the busiest Departments, was a retrograde decision. What we require now is regular updates to be published by the Department of Defence on the progress made towards achieving the 88 separate actions. This should be done twice a year - once at the end of the year and once mid-year. The Minister could also attend meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence to update members on it, perhaps a fortnight or three weeks after the publication of the report. Members of the Oireachtas could then have a detailed discussion each January, when the Houses resume, and each July, before the summer recess. Finally, it is clear that serious steps must be taken to address the lack of respect for the Defence Forces in how they are treated. All they are seeking is to be treated with dignity and respect. We must ensure they are properly remunerated for the jobs they do, that we retain the officers we are fortunate to have at present and that we make the job more attractive so more people will join the Defence Forces.

His speech included a great deal of information about investment in the Defence Forces, new aircraft, new ships and new everything. There was no information on serving members who do not have enough to live on. Can the Minister of State be proud of a Permanent Defence Force whose members are depending on welfare payments to make ends meet? Families are struggling to survive. I have received communications from privates, corporals and sergeants who simply cannot feed their families. When a bill comes through the letter box they must make a decision on whether they will pay the bill or buy food. That is simply not good enough especially when we are told, and perhaps the Minister of State will confirm this, that the Department returned €27 million of unused money last year. On the issue of commuting, the Minister said the reorganisation was to meet the organisational needs of the Defence Forces.The climate survey has established that following the reorganisation, 27% of those serving in Defence Forces now want to leave because the cost of commuting is making it next to impossible for some families to live. We are hearing stories of soldiers sleeping in their cars. Will the Minister of State confirm that soldiers are travelling from Donegal, Dundalk and Athlone to carry out regular barrack duties in Dublin? If that is the case, the Minister of State will have to admit that the reorganisation of the Defence Forces has been a disaster. Under the post-1994 contract, the introduction of which was an absolute insult, soldiers were expected to pull out after five years unless they could show they were fit enough to stay on for 12 years. Thanks to PDFORRA, that has been extended to 21 years. I ask the Minister of State to explain the exit strategy that is available to those who have to leave the Defence Forces. A young man who joins the Defence Forces at the age of 18 will be thrown on the scrapheap at the age of 39. Is an exit strategy in place to ensure these young men and women can have future careers when they leave the Defence Forces? The Minister of State said he fought for the appointment of an assistant secretary in the Department of Defence at an annual salary of between €128,000 and €149,000. When I submitted a freedom of information request on the matter, I learned that 75 emails were exchanged between the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I have been told that it is not in the public interest for the contents of those emails to be released. Clearly, this proposal did not receive an easy passage. Why is an assistant secretary for people needed, given that the Department of Defence has a personnel department and the Defence Forces have their own human resources section? The use of Lariam has been referred to as a horror story in a pill. Why is this drug still on the shelves of the Defence Forces? Why are we still administering it? Has legal advice been received suggesting that it must continue to be used so that cases currently coming before the High Court can be defended? We need to start treating our soldiers with respect. The use of dangerous drugs is not the way to do that. I would like to speak about local command and control. A lieutenant colonel who is in charge of a barracks has no control over the movements of his troops. If a guard of honour is requested at Eyre Square in Galway, the officer in charge of Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa cannot decide whether it should be provided - the matter has to go back to Dublin. What sort of nonsense is that? When we talk about the shortages in the Air Corps, great play is made of the fact that pilots are coming on stream. Pilots on single-engine aircraft take up to five years to qualify. It can be between five and ten years before they have the experience to fly twin-engine aircraft. We will have no one to fly all the CASA airplanes we are buying. Similarly, I was contacted the other day by a qualified air traffic controller who wants to join the Defence Forces, but no one in the Department will indicate to him whether direct entry is to be allowed. The use of the employee control framework, which was developed under the Croke Park and Lansdowne Road agreements, is nonsensical in the case of a dynamic organisation like the Defence Forces. It is not an ordinary organisation to which such a framework might be appropriate. There are very special medical, fitness and expertise capabilities that apply to the Defence Forces. My colleague who spoke about these issues on behalf of RACO is dead right. Eleven bomb disposal officers are available in this country even though the establishment figure is 35. I assure those who might think bomb disposal officers are not required that they are called out very regularly. The young men and women who are serving in these positions at present are taken from their homes to spend up to 21 days on duty. This brings me to the issue of duty pay. A soldier gets a miserable €20 into his pocket for spending 24 hours on duty. Where else in the world would that be found? We give soldiers €20 for 16 hours of overtime. It does not matter whether it is Sunday, Saturday, Christmas Day or a bank holiday. Soldiers do such duties because they are ultimately loyal. They do their best all the time, even in the horrendous circumstances they have to face. I want to focus on the number of officers that are available. The 28th Infantry Battalion in Donegal has no lieutenant colonel, two commandants, three captains and two lieutenants. The 27th Infantry Battalion in Dundalk has three of the 11 lieutenants it should have, one of the eight captains it should have and four of the five commandants it should have. The 7th Infantry Battalion in Cathal Brugha Barracks has one lieutenant colonel, four of the five commandants it should have, three of the eight captains it should have and one of the 11 lieutenants it should have. We are being told that the organisation is fit and ready for action. It is fit and ready for action because men and women get out of their beds to deliver when they are called on to do so, but it is not getting the resources it needs from the Department or the Government. The Organisation of Working Time Act is coming down the line towards the Minister of State very quickly. I would love to know his plans to facilitate soldiers under that Act. A number of adjudications are outstanding, including in respect of Army ranger wing tech pay. What are the Minister of State's plans for bringing these payments forward? The Minister of State spoke about ships. I wonder whether the public is aware that ships leave Haulbowline and anchor 20 or 25 miles off the coast because they do not have crews, that a ship had to sail into Galway to pick up an extra officer, or that ships which used to have three cooks now have just two cooks. Recently, a ship left port with just one cook to look after the entire crew. We should not pretend that the Defence Forces are fit for purpose. We should stop and rewind. The recruits who are being brought into the Defence Forces today will take a year to be trained. That is in the other ranks. Cadets are also being brought in, but I recently heard their recruitment described as great training for Aldi. Do we really want our uniformed personnel to aspire to a job in Aldi? The Defence Forces have been neglected by this Government and its predecessor. I ask the Minister of State to stop investing in hardware and start investing in people. He should meet some of the private soldiers - young men with families - who cannot afford to eat. I know he met members of the wives and partners group recently. I hope he took on board some of the information he was given by real people with real problems.

I will leave the points I have made with the Minister of State. We need to restore the Defence Forces as an organisation to the level of esteem it once held in our society. Right now, it is a second-level group in the public service.
#GabrielleMcFadden	unknown-#GabrielleMcFadden-party	unknown-#GabrielleMcFadden-dob	unknown-#GabrielleMcFadden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	170	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I had the pleasure of welcoming him to Athlone earlier this month when he reviewed the 110th Infantry Battalion as it headed on its tour of duty. As a nation, we take great pride in the services rendered by the men and women of the Army, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the Reserve Defence Force and the Civil Defence. We are glad to have them in times of need. When they engage in peacekeeping abroad, provide rescue services at home and save refugees in the Mediterranean, they give of themselves willingly and risk their own safety to ensure that of others. When flooding affected Athlone and many other areas in 2015, my instinctive first reaction was to call the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, to ask for the help of Army personnel. Yet again, they delivered by going above and beyond the call of duty to build flood defences and feed volunteers. Our Defence Forces provide a diverse range of specialist capabilities across all services that support citizens and the State in security and crisis situations. This professionalism and dedication to demanding challenges, which is unique to military service, should be acknowledged by the Government. It is clear to me, having spoken to many members of the Defence Forces, that certain issues are having a negative effect on morale. As I said in this House last week, we must put our money where our mouth is. According to the White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2015, "defence is the ultimate guarantee of freedom". If we truly value this freedom. we must do our duty by putting in place measures and initiatives to demonstrate our commitment to these men and women. Currently, most sectors of the Defence Forces are running below their establishment figure. This is a particular problem in specialist areas like bomb disposal, operational command, marine and electrical engineering, medicine and information technology. I am aware that the Minister of State has been working hard to address this, with 860 personnel being recruited this year in addition to the 690 personnel taken in last year.Recruitment alone, however, will not solve the problems unless retention of our most experienced staff is also tackled. We are losing them as fast as we are bringing them in. As the economy continues to recover, more and more opportunities are opening up for employment in other sectors and many serving personnel are leaving to take these opportunities up. More than 2,000 members have left the Defence Forces since 2013. We now find ourselves in a situation where many important and skilled positions are left unfilled. We need to ensure that service in the Army is an attractive career option for young men and women. Currently, and unbelievably, enlisted recruits are among the lowest paid public employees, with a basic salary starting at just €18,000 per annum. As has been said, many rely on the family income supplement and other State supports, which speaks for itself. This is totally unacceptable. I know that many of these issues are a hangover from cuts made by the last Fianna Fáil Government, which saw Defence Forces numbers fall to 8,000. Certain allowances were withdrawn and cut. It does not matter whose fault it is, we now have to fix it. We must bring the numbers back up to 9,500 and increase the income to a level that fits the esteem in which we hold the Defence Forces. I ask the Minister to consider the case for an increase in the military service allowance, which is payable to all Defence Forces personnel. It is intended to compensate servicemen and servicewomen for the unique conditions and special disadvantages of military life, which are acknowledged by the Department of Defence in its initial submission to the Public Service Pay Commission. An increase in this allowance would benefit all personnel equally but it would not impact on the wider public service as it is a sector-specific allowance. However, pay is not the only issue leading to demoralisation within the forces. There seem to be inordinate delays in routine matters such as progressing the 276 promotions from sergeant to sergeant major rank that are outstanding and the promotions of 107 privates to corporal. This suggests a degree of inertia within the Department and perhaps even a lack of co-operation between some officials and the military leadership. I call on the Minister of State to look at his Department in order to assess where pinch-points can be eliminated. There is a case for an increased role for military management in the area of HR policy to ensure that policy reflects the unique demands of military service.  Morale in the Army was damaged by the reorganisation of the brigade structure in 2012 and 2013. I was very vocal at the time in expressing my opposition to the removal of brigade status from Custume Barracks. The broader point, however, is that the reorganisation, as has been said earlier, has left many soldiers travelling long distances to carry out their duties. There are other issues, including pension entitlements, obligatory discharge ages, treatment for those suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder and implementation of the adjudicator’s findings for soldiers recruited after 1994 to name but a few. While speaking of showing esteem to our Defence Forces, I appeal to the Minister of State to award individual citations and medals to each of the soldiers of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion who were involved in the siege of Jadotville in 1961. While the unit citation was a recognition of their collective heroism and professionalism, I believe that each of them deserves individual acknowledgement. Coming back to the current matters, I am not raising these issues to be critical. I welcome the increases in capital and current expenditure in defence and the Minister of State’s efforts to deal with the issues around recruitment and retention. What I am doing is outlining some of the challenges that we face. By addressing them in a positive and determined fashion we can show our commitment to the men and women of the Defence Forces. As we move towards the centenary of the establishment of the National Army in 1922, we must put in place the structures and the funding necessary to ensure that Óglaigh na hEireann are motivated and resourced and can start into their second century ready to meet the changing needs of our great country.

Mar atá cluinte againn go dtí seo, bíonn daoine thar a bheith paiseanta ar an ábhar seo agus is léir cén fáth. I thank the Minister of State for being with us today and for his contribution. I appreciate the fact that some Members of this House have very long-standing experience and stakes in the issues which we are discussing here today. It has been very informative and insightful to hear some of those contributions thus far and I am sure Senator Wilson will add to them after I speak. I take the opportunity to welcome the representatives from PDFORRA and the families who are represented here today. When I get up to speak on issues like this, I sometimes wish I could instead give some of them the opportunity to stand here and say what needs to be said. I appreciate the Minister of State's input and the comprehensive report he has given. I do not think that anyone here is seeking to attack or undermine him. What we have heard so far - the collective voice from the Chamber on these issues - has been full of sincerity and has been dedicated to the men and women of the Defence Forces. There has been a very sincere and genuine aspiration to try to have some of the outstanding issues resolved. As my colleagues have outlined quite a number of those issues, I will not engage in repetition, but I wish to make a number of points while the Minister of State is here. As has been said, the operational capacity of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps has been stretched to breaking point and morale among rank and file personnel has never been lower. By any objective criteria, the attempts at reorganising the Army have been a disaster and when combined with the cutbacks in pay and entitlements it is hardly surprising that so many military families are struggling to cope. The recent "Prime Time" report showed how the reorganisation of the Defence Forces has resulted in widespread poor morale, with low pay and long-term isolation from family and home being identified as the primary drivers of the exodus of personnel - many of them highly trained and experienced individuals. The impact of Government policy on the operational capacity of the Defence Forces cannot be overstated. The crux of this was outlined very comprehensively by Senator Craughwell during his contribution. I make this point very consciously because I believe this Government has shown an ideological stance that does not respect, cherish or appreciate the contribution of those held very high esteem within our society. For me it comes as no great surprise, although it is a tremendous shame, that a Government which leaves our senior citizens and pensioners on hospital trolleys, which leaves countless children up and down the State in hotel and temporary accommodation, and which puts people into direct provision in a most unsympathetic way would treat our Defence Forces personnel in this same way. It is indicative of a broader problematic culture, but one that certainly can be overturned, and which I hope will be. It seems the Government is treating armed forces personnel unfairly, because they face a blanket ban on trade unions. This ban has been found to be an unacceptable violation of Article 11 by the European Court of Human Rights. The Government should lift the ban and allow representatives of the armed forces to negotiate the fixing of wages and conditions and ensure that they have access to the Work Place Relations Commission and Labour Court. There is also serious concern about the well-being of personnel, especially in regard to the Government's refusal to withdraw the anti-malaria drug, Lariam, which is being routinely used when for most other countries it is a drug of last resort. This cavalier attitude to the health and well-being of personnel is also reflected in the way highly toxic and dangerous chemicals were handled at Casement Aerodrome. Trainee personnel were being exposed to dangerous, corrosive and cancerous chemicals. The health and safety protocols at Casement Aerodrome are wholly inadequate. There should be an urgent review of existing procedures and protocols at Casement Aerodrome and other military installations where Defence Forces personnel work with hazardous materials. The State must also deal with claims by serving and retired Air Corps personnel more compassionately. In this regard, it should learn from the Australian military which has introduced compensation schemes to assist retired and serving air corp personnel whose health was compromised by working with dangerous chemicals. To reiterate Senator Craughwell's remarks, and not to diminish or downplay the issue, the Minister of State can spend all the money he wishes on material and capital investment, but unless he invests in people - people who put themselves at the front line and step up in the service of this State - then it is not worth a jot. Senator Gallagher referred to the issue of recruitment and this has been touched on by other speakers. I have a question and I hope the Minister of State will excuse my ignorance and perhaps even my naivety in this regard. How much can recruitment drives for the Defence Forces extend to the North? We can signpost people in Derry to the Wild Atlantic Way and put billboards around Belfast directing people to Dublin Airport but I wonder if the Department is considering having personnel attending jobs and careers fairs or universities to provide the opportunity for Irish citizens from the North who may be able to step up and serve. It is perhaps a consideration for the future. I say this with the caveat that I would not direct anyone into a service that does not respect them, protect them or give them the necessary dignity to rear a family, build a home life and be able to serve their families and communities as much as they do when expected to serve the State, whether here or abroad. Sin mo mhéid.

I also welcome the representatives of PDFORRA and the families of service personnel. They are in the Gallery this afternoon. This is a topic that both I and Senator Craughwell, along with others, have sought for quite some time so we very much appreciate that the Minister of State is here this afternoon. As Senator Ó Donnghaile has stated, many of the areas have been covered and I have no wish to go back over them. Suffice it to say, as my colleague, Senator Gallagher outlined, the people of this country have much respect for our Defence Forces, our Reserve Defence Forces and our Civil Defence. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure their conditions of service are appropriate and the level of equipment is fit for purpose for a modern defence force. The State's defence policy, its implementation and its resourcing must be appropriate. For our part, Fianna Fáil has committed to a defence policy that is measured, fit for purpose, appropriately resourced and which allows the Department of Defence and Defence Forces to go forward with confidence in an ever-changing world of new and emerging threats. As my colleague, Senator Gallagher, has pointed out, over the past 25 years there have been eight reorganisations or reviews within the Defence Forces. However, there is a significant downside to all of this, as it has resulted in turmoil and relocation, uncertainty and confusion for members of the Defence Forces. Such tensions and family displacements are not conducive to optimum operational viability or good morale. The Defence Forces have been an easy target for cost-cutting and the unreserved loyalty and professionalism of its members have been taken advantage of. Policy has become a matter of fitting the Defence Forces into a particular budget, which is not acceptable. It is not the making of policy but rather the emasculation of the Defence Forces by stealth. The Defence Forces now need stability, policy and resource certainty, and my party is committed to this necessity The Minister of State pointed out that in 2012, on the joint advice of the then chief of staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence it was decided to maximise operational capacity and provide for an organisation that is flexible and which can accommodate new, unexpected demands. As part of that strategy, in March 2012, the only purpose-built Army barracks in the history of the State - the most modern in Europe - was closed. This was done to maximise operational capacity and accommodate new or unexpected demands. It was pointed out by myself and other Members of this House and the Lower House that this action was a mistake. We have since had an increase in dissident republican activity in the Border area and Brexit. I am amazed to hear the Minister of State say this afternoon that Brexit will not have an effect on the operational functions of the Army. From Donegal to Louth there are no Army personnel based on the Border. It is an area with over 300 crossings and it will become a frontier. As the UK exits - I hate using that term with regard to the Six Counties of our country but as we speak they are members of the United Kingdom - the North of Ireland will no longer be part of the European Union. The British Government does not know what will be the consequences of that exit and the Irish Government certainly does not know the consequences. How can the Minister of State assure us that he is confident - as somebody responsible for the Defence Forces - there will be no impact on how the Defence Forces defend our State? It is not acceptable and I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that. I appreciate that the Minister of State did not have time to deal with the Reserve Defence Force in his speech. What are the up-to-date figures for the Reserve Defence Forces? How many members does it have and what proposals are there to accommodate them in appropriate premises so they can carry out training? I pay tribute to the Civil Defence, whose members are located throughout the Twenty-six Counties, for the excellent work they do on a daily and weekly basis.

It goes without saying that as a country we are of course truly proud and grateful for the support of the Permanent Defence Force, the Civil Defence and all other auxiliary supports around them. They do an amazing job, which is very important. It is also important for us to deal with their remuneration. I have heard stories of members of the Defence Forces having to apply for family income supplement, which is surely very disappointing for the men and women of our Defence Forces. Platitudes are not good enough and it is about supporting them through their conditions of work, ongoing training and welfare for families and children as they work on behalf of the State. The Minister of State and his Government are, correctly, very proud of their achievements, which is clear from the various ceremonies and celebrations where I have seen the Minister of State. I have no doubt he takes the role very seriously and is very committed to it. It is time to shine a light on our Defence Forces, including the Permanent Defence Force and Civil Defence. We must deal with their wages, their terms and conditions and the health and welfare of the members and their families. I say this in the broadest sense of the word "health" as it is important that people serving this country are given the full support of the State in everything they do. That goes for remuneration and other opportunities, such as training and possibilities of promotion within every rank of the service. That is important and we should hear more about. I wish to raise some specific issues.What is the Minister of State's vision and plan for Mullingar barracks? Is it too late to cry halt and retain the barracks, given the importance of its location? Are there opportunities to develop it for the Civil Defence or the Reserve Defence Force? We need answers to these questions because they are very important. I would be pleased if the Minister of State could share something with us today in this regard. I believe he can stop this and pull back from it. As we speak here, unless he knows something I do not, the barracks has not been sold. It is of strategic importance in the short, medium and long term. It makes absolute sense that he, in conjunction with his Cabinet partners, would reconsider selling and instead retain it and decide what its future is. I ask him to address these issues. I will conclude by referring again to the importance of the welfare, health and well-being of our Defence Forces and their being fully remunerated for the wonderful, sterling, distinguished work they do on behalf of each and every one of our citizens in this State.

I apologise for not having recognised their attendance earlier. Their presence is very much appreciated. They represent their members extremely well, and there is very good dialogue between my Department and PDFORRA. Senators spoke about spending money on equipment and not on personnel. I point out that I do not set the payscales for members of the Irish Defence Forces. I wish to make that very clear in the House. Payscales are set by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Service Pay Commission. I will make no apologies whatsoever for spending the millions of euro we are spending on equipment in barracks because if we do not have a well-equipped defence force, we might as well have none.

I think members of Sinn Féin were the only Senators who had anything positive to say about this and I thank them for their comments in that regard - and the Senator on my left. I was referring only to the Opposition. It is very important we marry equipment with members and personnel of the Defence Forces to give them the capability and capacity to carry out their jobs and whatever is asked of them by the Government. We have spent over €500 million on new ships and €55 million on armoured vehicles, made a huge investment in the Air Corps and invested in many other areas. We will not open Mullingar barracks. I have asked that the Department proceed with its sale and that the local authority in Westmeath take it off our hands. The local authority has not responded positively. I do not want to see Mullingar barracks go to rack and ruin like other barracks over the years. Senators spoke about the issue of personnel retention. I would be the first to recognise that we face huge retention challenges. However, I am not sure whether Senators afforded themselves the opportunity to read the report of Public Service Pay Commission published only two weeks ago. If they do so, they will see that the Defence Forces have been recognised, and rightly so, this year. This is because of the work of members of PDFORRA such as those in the Gallery, my Department, RACO and the Chief of Staff raising with me the issues of pay and conditions and the retention challenges I face as Minister of State. I have raised these issues with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I was very interested to hear Senator Craughwell's comments in this regard. This is a man who has represented the teacher unions for many years.

I raised this issue directly with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the Tuesday before last at Cabinet. I hope I am not breaching Cabinet confidentiality, but directly after me the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills raised similar issues. We cannot as a Government select one organisation and say we are going to give its members a pay increase and forget about everyone else. We have to move appropriately with pay increases. I met the wives and partners of Defence Forces members last week and told them this and said I will fight vehemently on their behalf, on the members' behalf and on behalf of PDFORRA and RACO. These representative organisations, specifically the two recognised ones, namely, PDFORRA and RACO, have told me of the huge challenges their organisations face from their members. I absolutely acknowledge this and will bring the message back to the Minister. One thing I did make sure of is that PDFORRA and RACO, even though they do not have full union status, will have a similar input at the negotiating table into the future. They will be able to get their message across. Senator Ó Donnghaile said members of the Defence Forces cannot join unions. There are reasons for this that date to the foundation of the State and the Irish Defence Forces. However, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in negotiations on Garda pay a number of months ago, spoke about the GRA having access to the Workplace Relations Commission. I insisted at Cabinet that officials from my Department sit on that committee to make sure the representative views of PDFORRA and RACO are listened to and that we can bring back whatever is offered to members of An Garda Síochána. I want to do this for the members of the Irish Defence Forces because, as Minister of State with responsibility for defence, I am extremely proud of every man and woman in the organisation. I think I have dealt with pay and conditions and retention. I encourage anyone who has not read the report of the Public Service Pay Commission to read it. Direct entry and re-entry were referred to. Action will be taken on these two issues. We either act on the deficiencies we see in the organisation or we do not, and one of the areas where we can act is direct entry. It has worked in many other areas in the public service where there are specific needs and requirements. If people leave the Irish Defence Forces and feel they have something to bring back to the organisation, I am happy to see them re-enter the organisation, although they may not come in on the same terms and conditions on which they left.I have asked the Secretary General of my Department and the Chief of Staff to come back to me with a realistic proposal on this which makes it attractive to bring somebody back into the organisation. There are many people who want to return to the organisation who felt the grass was greener on the other side. Having left, they realised they would rather be where they were whether as a commissioned officer or otherwise. I am insisting that they will be allowed to return. People spoke about the climate survey. It was an act of great leadership for the Chief of Staff and the general staff to carry out a climate survey in the Defence Forces. It gave them an opportunity to identify the challenges within the organisation. They knew what many were and they are not all about pay and conditions. If I gave every Member here or every public servant a survey on what they wanted, pay would be at the top. There are other challenges within the organisation, however, that were fed back and recognised within the climate survey. If one does not have that information, one will not be able to fix the problems one faces. I am happy that the leadership - the general staff - is seeking to mitigate the challenges in the organisation and I will assist in every way I can. The Chief of Staff spoke yesterday morning to over 200 members of the Defence Forces. It is very important that they get to feel that the leadership of the organisation receives feedback from the members and that they are listened to. A huge number of issues are there which can easily be fixed. If one does not know what they are, however, they cannot be fixed. It is an opportunity for the general staff to see exactly what are the issues. I was asked about barrack duty. It is absolutely true that there are people travelling from Athlone and Donegal to Dublin. When a member joins the Irish Defence Forces, he or she does not join an organisation that will accommodate him or her in the barracks that is closest to his or her home. Of course, people are going to have to travel. It is part and parcel of a person becoming a member of the Defence Forces.

Perhaps Senator Craughwell will listen for a second. Where are the biggest threats? Where is the biggest threat of a terrorist attack? It is in the greater Dublin area. It is important that if there is a terrorist attack in Dublin, members of the Defence Forces know the geography and exactly with what they are dealing. There are challenges there about people having to travel to do barrack duty. I recognise that and I have spoken to the general staff about it. We are trying to fix it, but it will not be done overnight. We could pull people back from overseas but I have no doubt that if we did, Senator Craughwell would jump up and down about that too. It is hard to win in some people's eyes. The issue of Lariam was raised. I receive advice from the Defence Forces. I have asked them to identify the most effective medication which is suitable for members serving in sub-Saharan Africa and I have been told that it is Lariam. In 2015, some 438,000 people lost their lives to malarial disease. This is advice I have been given by the Defence Forces through its medical corps. Senator Craughwell spoke about EOD call outs. I cannot account that we have never responded to an EOD call out. We have challenges in that area, which is one of the reasons direct entry or re-entry will be sought to mitigate the issues there. The Senator also asked about ships' crews. I hope he recognises that I cannot micromanage the organisation. This is the first time I have heard of one cook or two cooks going out where there should be three. If things like that are brought to my attention, I will be able to address them.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	198	I must point out the following. We have had continual recruitment since 2011. I did not have overall responsibility for defence at the time, but I was Minister of State in the Department. As a Government, we were criticised by Fianna Fáil for carrying out continual recruitment in 2011. It was the only area in the public service where there was continual recruitment from 2011. During the lean years of the worst recession in the history of the State, we had continual recruitment in the Irish Defence Forces, but were nevertheless criticised. We have challenges to bring the strength up to 9,500, but the financial and economic resources are in place to achieve it. While people are exiting the Defence Forces, more people are coming in on an annual basis than are leaving. There are issues with Garda checks and I have challenged the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner to mitigate the issues there. There are over 55,000 recipients of family income supplement in Ireland. The Government recognises quite rightly that there is a need for family income supplement depending on the circumstances of a family. It is not just members of the Defence Forces who are in receipt of family income supplement. However, I hear what Senators have had to say and what the representative organisations have said to me about it. Members spoke about the reorganisation. One of the reasons for the reorganisation was the existence of under-strength units. While it is great to have Army barracks all over the place, one must also have full-strength units that can carry out whatever is requested of them. A layer of middle management was cut out during that reorganisation. When one reflects on that reorganisation, as I often have and as I have said to the Chief of Staff, one acknowledges that not everything went 100% well. There are some areas we need to revisit to make corrections. Any organisation or company which has a reorganisation will inevitably have issues that did not go as expected.I would be the first to say it is about standing up and agreeing that there are issues that we have to correct and examine. While I am doing that, I have to consider the resource envelope available to me and my Department. A Sinn Féin Senator referred to the recruitment drive. Members from Northern Ireland comprise a large number of the Irish Defence Forces, many of whom are based in Dundalk and others are based in Dublin. Reference was made to Brexit. While the negotiations have yet to commence, it will be recognised that the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Theresa May, have said they do not want a hard border. The security of the State is, in the first instance, a matter for An Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice and Equality. If requests are made or assistance sought, that will come to the Department. Prudent planning is continuing within the Defence Forces, through the Chief of Staff, regarding Brexit and how it might affect the Defence Forces. A Senator referred to the new assistant secretary in the Department. The management board of the Department of Defence currently comprises a Secretary General, two assistant secretaries and a director. The Department is involved in the delivery of a major programme of policy implementation, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. The Department of Defence is engaged in all aspects of policy, from international security and defence and future planning to procurement, property management, human resources, industrial relations, litigation and legislation. The work of the Department also includes financial planning and oversight for the sector, as well as national emergency planning and the Civil Defence.  This is a position about which I spoke to the Secretary General following my appointment when I saw the workload of senior management in the Department. I will defend the recruitment of another assistant secretary within the Department because of the amount of domestic work involved.  More important is our work with Brussels and international peacekeeping operations. We are involved in a significant number of peacekeeping operations involving ten or 12 missions. They do not happen by a person picking up the phone and saying we are sending 300, 400, ten or 11 people. Between the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, a significant amount of work is involved in that responsibility.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	203	I thank the Members of Seanad Éireann for the opportunity to address them today on the future of the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme which is administered by my Department. As the House will be aware, the ANC scheme is one which farmers across the country are familiar with and is an important issue for many people. The areas of natural constraints scheme, as it currently stands, was introduced under the 2014-2020 rural development programme as a replacement for the previous disadvantaged areas and less favoured areas schemes which had been in place since 1975. Payments under the ANC scheme are an important support for farmers across the country in addressing cash flow issues and contributing to the continued growth and development of the agrifood sector. The scheme was originally introduced in 1975 in recognition of the fact that farmers in particular areas were faced with challenges relating to lower productivity and higher production costs compared with farmers in other areas where levels of disadvantage were not as pronounced. Given that the scheme in various guises has been in place for over 40 years, it is no surprise that the farming community is interested in how the scheme will develop in the coming years. The original scheme was based on addressing issues, such as rural depopulation, threats to the conservation of the countryside, lower income levels and the presence of lands which were more difficult to efficiently farm. Since its introduction, the scheme has been subject to a number of reviews at EU level, and Ireland has been very successful over the course of those reviews in ensuring that areas facing particular difficulties and additional costs were included as eligible under the scheme. From the first review of the scheme in 1976 through the fifth review in 1996, the amount of hectares in Ireland included as eligible under the scheme grew from just under 4 million ha to over 5 million ha. At the same time, these reviews also resulted in more land being designated as having higher levels of disadvantage which attract higher levels of payment. Thus, we can see that this scheme has a long history of review and refinement since its introduction in Ireland. The significant level of financial support delivered through the scheme in the years since 1975, and the changes in eligible land in Ireland as part of the various reviews, show a recognition of the fact that the challenges faced by farmers in certain areas pose a significant threat to the future viability of these farming communities. The specific objectives of the ANC scheme are thus structured round themes such as ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems which take environmental protection into account. I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to the more than 95,000 farmers who receive the payment annually. With this in mind, I have prioritised the efficient payment of the ANC scheme in my Department in recent years. At present, the ANC scheme is structured around a tiered payment structure. Those farming on so-called mountain-type land receive €109.71 on their first 10 forage hectares, and €95.99 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 ha. Farmers with land categorised as more severely handicapped lowland are paid €95.99 per forage hectare up to a maximum of 30 ha. Finally, those with less severely handicapped lowland are paid €82.27 per forage hectare up to a maximum of 30 ha. As part of the negotiations of the new rural development programme, a new category was added to the scheme in 2015. In recognition of the particular barriers and costs that island farmers face, a new category of payment was introduced for off-shore island farmers. Farmers on off-shore island now qualify for payments of €250 per hectare on the first 20 ha, €170 per hectare on 20 ha to 34 ha, inclusive, and €70 per hectare on 34 ha to 40 ha, inclusive. In 2016, payments under the scheme began in mid-September, and to date over €201 million has been paid to over 94,000 farmers. Along with the payment of €1.18 billion to some 124,000 farmers to date under the 2016 basic payment scheme, this is a very important financial support for the agrifood sector and for families in rural Ireland. Under the new Common Agricultural Policy finalised in 2013, the new rural development regulation introduced a change in how eligible areas under the ANC scheme were to be defined. The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date had been based on a range of socioeconomic factors. These factors included: particular stocking density levels, family farm income levels, population density and the percentage to the total working population engaged in agriculture. The change introduced in the new rural development regulation required that, from 2018, eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of biophysical criteria. In cases where a member state does not introduce this new system for payment, the regulation sets out that the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. The purpose of this change in approach is linked to a concern at EU level that areas were not being designated as disadvantaged in a consistent manner across the various member states. The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are low temperature, dryness, excess soil moisture, limited soil drainage, unfavourable texture and stoniness, shallow rooting depth, poor chemical properties and steep slope. My Department has commenced work on this project and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data regarding the new criteria.Department officials have been in contact with the Joint Research Centre and Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in the EU Commission in regard to technical issues arising. The ongoing analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will, in parallel, be subjected to a refinement process. A number of the criteria I have listed will not have an impact on the new designation in Ireland, while others will have a small impact. In effect, the Irish process will be mostly affected by soil drainage and soil moisture excess. As outlined previously, in the original rural development regulations, the new ANC designation was scheduled to be in place for payment in the 2018 scheme year. This is the timeline towards which my Department has been working. However, as part of the ongoing discussion on amendments to regulations at EU level, Austria raised the possibility of extending the deadline on an optional basis. Ireland supported this proposal, along with Latvia, Slovenia, Poland, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Slovakia. The proposal is currently passing through the relevant approval process at EU level, along with a number of other regulatory changes in what is referred to as the "omnibus proposal". The technical work is ongoing, thus it is not currently possible to set out the final set of areas to be eligible for payment. However, given the importance of the ANC scheme in the Irish context, officials in my Department are continuing to engage with our colleagues at EU level in order to ensure the best possible outcome of the review is secured. It has been proposed that the current category of mountain-type land be maintained in any new ANC scheme and that the rate of payment attaching to this land be increased to a rate more in line with the current rate payable to offshore island farmers. The redesignation project will entail a new ANC scheme to be inserted into the rural development programme by way of a formal amendment. This will entail categories of payments being agreed with the EU Commission. Any such categories of payment must be based on the level of constraint identified by the redesignation process and based on the income forgone and costs incurred by farmers in farming such lands. These are fundamental principles that the EU Commission will insist on being the basis for payment rates. Thus, while it is likely that there will be differentiated rates of payment, as in the current scheme, it is not possible at this stage to say how many categories there will be and what rates will be payable. It will, however, remain a key priority to ensure the payments under the ANC scheme continue to be focused on achieving the best possible value for money by targeting those areas faced with significant constraints. I am aware that many farmers will have a direct interest in the outcome of this process. Accordingly, I expect there will be consultation with key stakeholders as this process develops further. I thank the Members of the Seanad again for the opportunity to outline to them the most recent developments in what is a very important scheme for the farming community.

I thank him for the promptness with which he arrived here to discuss this important issue on the back of some shenanigans we had here over recent weeks given the proposals to amend the Order of Business to take a motion on this. At all times in opposing the amendment to the Order of Business, we have requested that the Minister come to the House. There are a number of facts we would like to hear before we put our full deck of cards on the table. I will proceed to address some of these issues for the Minister. The Minister referred to the importance of the scheme to rural areas. I will address this. From 1975, it has been designed to help the smallholder on the family farm in the most restricted rural areas where the quality of land is very poor, owing to gradient or soil drainage. If the disadvantaged areas scheme, as it was known, had not been introduced, many smallholdings would have been abandoned and it would not have been feasible for the farming families to maintain them. It was in the interest not only of ensuring farm family income but also of biodiversity. Bearing in mind the maintenance of these plots of rural land with serious constraints, farming, including moderate farming, is what harnesses and maintains biodiversity and the nature of the area. This is the most important contribution of this scheme, along with providing badly needed income for the farm family. I will not rehearse the figures in the Minister’s report but the scheme is worth €200 million to rural communities, which is no small sum in rural areas, including the most rural areas. We in Fianna Fáil have always maintained that the most disadvantaged must receive the greatest payment. The most disadvantaged areas and the areas of most constraint are the hill and mountain farms. As I have put on record on more than one occasion, we agreed with the Sinn Féin motion in this regard. We want the money to go to the most constrained. That is basically what it says on the tin. The money is not something we want to spread out like butter all over the country just to make sure everybody gets a little. It is a subsistence payment for those who are most constrained. It is on them that we want the money spent.  Before we could support the motion that was tabled last week, we would need to know a few different facts about the scheme. The first concerns money. If we were to give the mountain and hill farmers a payment equivalent to that paid on the islands, where would it come from? How much is in the kitty? Does the Minister propose to include in the ANC budget the under-expenditure in the other parts of the rural development programme? There is money for other schemes that is not being spent. It is sitting on the shelf and we feel it would be very advantageous and result in most value if it were diverted to the ANC scheme and put in as part of that pool. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to an increase of €25 million in this area. We would like to hear about where the Minister is thinking of spending that money. As I stated, our emphasis is on the concept of giving the most money to the most constrained.  When and where will we see the new biophysical maps? With that in mind, why has the review been kicked down the line until 2019? The Minister was saying his Department was on target, would have all its ducks in a line, would have all its maps processed and would have its consultation process in place for the 2018 review but now we believe Ireland is supporting a proposal to push the review down the line to 2019? That said, it may not be the worst thing ever if it gives us more time to analyse the proposed maps that are to be submitted from the Irish side. I hope it would allow for an appeals process for people aggrieved over the new application procedure. This is if there are those who will be left out who were included previously. It is vital that they be given an opportunity to appeal. I propose to the Minister that the maps and submission from the Irish side be sent, prior to their submission, to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for review. This is vital to such an important sector. Reviewing the proposal of the Irish side is the purpose of the committee.  In any proposal under the rural development regulation, I would like to see addressed the issues faced by people with SACs and SPAs in low-lying areas. It was not mentioned in any way in the Sinn Féin motion that such people were getting absolutely no recognition or compensation for the associated inconvenience and constraint. As part of the review, we have the fine-tuning section. My reading of it is that it will involve the elimination of areas that had a constraint but which no longer have one due to the diligence of the farmer, or other individual, on foot of investing money. Owing to the hard work of the farmer, his spending of a lot of money on drainage and his diligence and efficiency, land with a poor drainage history might be transformed and, therefore, be taken out of the relevant category and not included as an area of constraint.I would have serious reservations in that area, in particular, with regard to drainage as in the example I cited. The Minister, as a farmer, knows the position. He comes from a far drier and better quality part of the country than that from which I come.

If one did it this year and brought in an inspector next year, the inspector would say one has a lovely field, but if one were to bring the inspector back in two years, rushes would be growing back and the work would need to be done again. I would be fearful of this fine-tuning element where people, who in essence still have the constraint of disadvantaged land from a drainage point of view, would be eliminated, as it were. When we get down to the final application, I hope, as in the case of lands situated on offshore island that are designated as areas of specific constraint, that we will make the maximum use of the 10% designation.

Having been raised on a farm, there are two big elements in agricultural life on which farmers are dependent. One is an adequate income and the other is the weather. The dry, sunny conditions this week have given farmers a guarantee of sorts about what they can do on their farm, but prevailing financial climates are more precarious. Question marks surrounding the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme are feeding into that latter issue because of the degree of uncertainty about the new classification system and its eventual completion. The new system of designation is to be based on robust, empirical biophysical data that indicate the suitability of land for disadvantaged status subvention. Debate in rural Ireland on the ANC qualification criteria is ongoing and nobody wants to lose out on money for their farms. I believe that the main consensus that should emerge from the recent discourse on the ANC scheme is that all payments made under it are equitable and that those who qualify do so based on geographical merit. People who need it most should benefit most for farming flooded land, steep land, land with very poor soil, vegetation or low temperatures. In short, a topography in a subterranean structure where farmers are really struggling to get a return for their investment.  It is essential that the new mapping exercise accurately adjudicates which locations are naturally disadvantaged, ones that impose major limitations on farmers to do their job and that it will continue to do so. People who work on improving disadvantaged areas should be rewarded for doing so, for responding to the environmental challenges that face them in generating an income for their family and for the perseverance involved in such an undertaking. Some farmers in marginal areas are fighting battles on different fronts, as witnessed by the recent spate of wildfires on the hills around the country. These farmers have literally mountains to climb every day and should be compensated for their productivity on difficult land for the service they provide to the environment and to their local community. In addition, farmers who have made improvements to their disadvantaged land should not be punished for doing so by being excluded from the new scheme. Their efforts ought to be recognised in this regard. The Government clearly does not want regressive decline in areas where farmers have gone the extra mile to improve the acres that they farm.  The new designated areas for consideration in the scheme based on biophysical parameters only have caused some controversy. The Minister will have his work cut out to facilitate farmers who will feel that they have been wrongly excluded. However, the new eligibility typology is a fairer way than the current socio-economic and biophysical model and has the potential to distribute the subsidy in a more balanced way than has been the case hitherto.  At present, it is estimated that some three quarters of the country is designated as being a disadvantaged area, which might be a surprise to many outside the agricultural community, and almost 100,000 farmers are receiving a modest share of the total €205 million allocation for the scheme. The biophysical criteria should be able to make a scientifically compelling case for farmers who need some form of compensation to sustain a viable livelihood in places where there is an existing natural handicap. In addition, farmers who are deemed ineligible should be able to appeal any decision in an open and transparent way when the nationwide location maps are released in draft form. The new mapping exercise of land is a very detailed undertaking on the part of the Department, one that requires rigorous analysis in determining which areas can be classified as needing the support. It would be helpful if the Minister could provide a specific date for completion of his Department's mapping project so that farmers can see if they qualify based on the indices that have been applied. Crucially at this stage, farmers and their representatives need regular and concise information on how the ANC review is developing and when it will be finalised. Disadvantaged area payments are a crucial source of income for many farmers and they need assurances on this very sensitive issue. I urge the Minister to send the completed new maps to the European Commission by next year. The Department can still provide farmers with regular updates and opportunities for consultation regarding the publication of the draft maps in the coming months. The dissemination of information is a sure way of ameliorating the sense of uncertainty, apprehension and even dread that some farmers feel regarding the confirmation of the national distribution of the ANC subsidies. I thank the Minister for hearing what we have to say in the Seanad. I hope he does not mind my briefly raising an issue I have raised with him previously, namely, the plight of Cavan poultry farmer, Alo Mohan, who as a result of his dispute with Carton Brothers finds himself unable to earn a livelihood.

It is an emotive one for many farmers. It is obvious why that is the case. Owing to European designation, farmers have to deal with the issue of the designation of lands as special areas of conservation or special protection areas, which limits what they can do with the land and, invariably, that land is naturally constrained, meaning it is less productive. In many ways farmers can perceive that they are caught on all sides. Therefore, to compensate or assist farmers in those circumstances who have poor, marginal land, the payment under the ANC scheme is vital. We have been considering something in the vein of this payment, which has been ongoing since 1975, and now we are considering a change to the criteria. With the move from socio-economic to biophysical criteria, naturally farmers are nervous about what that will mean for them on their farms and for their families and farm income. The 2015 Teagasc national farm survey, which highlights the low incomes of farmers in general but particularly hill farmers who have been mentioned, indicates that farmers have an average income of only €283 per week, which is well below the industrial wage. That puts into context the challenges facing farmers. I welcome the support from the Minister and Government that the review would be extended because of the new criteria. I also welcome that there may be a more full discussion of what is a fair distribution of the payment to farmers, bearing in mind some are more constrained, or have their hands tied, more than others in that some land is much poorer than other land, and that we might arrive at a fairer distribution of the payment. It also gives certainty to farmers for 2018.At the IFA health farming forum yesterday in Connemara, its president, Mr. Joe Healy, had the same request, which I would support. On the €25 million increase in the ANC payments which has been identified in the programme for Government, can we - notwithstanding and assuming that this review is extended and that the deadline would be extended to 2019 - in effect see this payment being rolled out to farmers even in advance of the conclusion of the review so that that money can actually be spent? It is much needed. I have a question for when the review takes place if additional land is included, which it looks like there will be, and I know there is a grading of land and payments. At this juncture I would like to welcome the significant work of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the work he did in negotiating an additional category of payment under the rural development plan which rightly saw offshore islands benefit from a more significant rate than less constrained and less disadvantaged farmers. I think that was a positive step forward, and we need that nuanced approach for fairness. Going back to my question, if we have additional land, will there be some recognition of that in the form of an increase of budget to allow for the fact that some people who are operating with difficult land, who should rightfully be within the ANC scheme, might also be included? One of the previous speakers also mentioned this. On the issue of land reclamation and farmers who have done much to improve their lands and make them more productive, how might they be dealt with going forward? People who are proactive and do what they can do should not necessarily be penalised compared with somebody who does not. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that. I thank the Minister for addressing us today and attending to take our questions in the Chamber. I look forward to his response.

The issue that we are talking about today is, in a sense, how hard farmers have to work when they are dealing with areas of natural constraint. Looking at these payments, I suppose it is a bit like saying to a teacher who is working in a school that is run-down that he or she is not going to get quite as much even though that teacher does the same hours as somebody who is in a bigger or flashier school. I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address this really important issue. He knows that Sinn Féin has had a motion on the Seanad Order Paper for some time now. That motion is very simple. It calls for the retention of mountain grazing as a separate category under the review of the areas of natural constraint scheme and for the payments going forward to properly reflect the multiple biophysical and specific constraints experienced by farmers who farm mountain-type land and for those payments to be at similar rates to the current offshore island rates. It also calls for the new map of ANC areas to be published in time for proper consultation before the draft is sent in to the EU. That was pretty simple for us. I cannot understand what was so offensive about that motion such that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have voted against it three times now. In fact, today they voted not to allow a motion after this debate on the very same motion. Where is the democracy in that? I welcome the opportunity here because it is a crucial issue to discuss. Even though it has been referred to by those on my left as "shenanigans", it has brought us here to debate this issue, and I do not think it would have been debated otherwise. I welcome the review of this scheme. The Minister knows that the ANC scheme provides for a payment to farmers with land in constrained areas to compensate for all or part of the additional costs and the income forgone relating purely to the constraints for agricultural production. The review provides an opportunity to address the inequality that exists in farm incomes and that is the basic crux of the matter. This can be done by front-loading the payments on the first 20 ha to €250 and increasing the rate on the next 14 ha to €170 per hectare as well as allowing €70 for the remaining 6 ha, to a maximum of 40 ha. The mountain-type category must be designated as an upland-specific category. Mountain grazing land must be recognised a specific constraint first, before any biophysical constraint is added. We do not think there is any technical or legal reason this cannot be done. If there is 10% of a specific constraint built into the review, then this must be on the mountain grazing category. Looking at the overall budget of the €195 million, and the additional €25 million committed by Government - which we in Sinn Féin welcome - we believe that it can be increased to €300 million by using the underspend from the national rural development programme, NRDP, budget. The Minister might ask where that is going to come from, but we have already identified underspends, and we know that GLAS is going to be underspent by between €60 million and €70 million.

These are our figures. The Minister is part of the same Government that said that 700 farming jobs a week were created in 2013, which fed into the 62,000 jobs that had been created in that year. Perhaps the Minister will hear me out to identify the sources of income. GLAS underspent by between €60 million and €70 million. There was an underspend on the sheep scheme of around €5 million. There was another possibly €10 million to €15 million underspend in the knowledge transfer scheme as well as an underspend in targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS. In looking at this issue, we in Sinn Féin have at all times endeavoured to put constructive, solution-based ideas forward to address the inequality in farm incomes. We cannot allow the unfairness to continue. I ask the Minister that, as an immediate measure, the €25 million be allocated to farmers farming mountain grazing land. If the Minister could give us a commitment on that, it would reassure us. Can the Minister clarify a couple of points for me? What is the legitimate reason for the delay in the ANC review? I know the Minister says it because of Austria and some other countries putting forward proposals. We do not believe that it was necessary to have an extension on that time. We are fearful that within that time the can is being kicked down the road. This review is something that needs to be treated as something positive, where something can be done. It really concerns me when Senator Mulherin refers to additional land being included. I would not see that as the case at all. In fact, I would see it as a restraining of the land. I think 75% comes under this scheme at the moment. For me, it would be a case of lesser lands with higher payments weighted towards the hill farmers and those with more constraints. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that for us. Fine Gael Senators referred twice to additional land being included. How much of the mapping has been done at this stage? We would have expected all of it to be done. I certainly think that, for the way forward, it would be constructive to have the mapping put before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for consultation once it is concluded. The farming groups should also be given an opportunity to come in at that stage to input into it as well. Will the Minister give us a timeline here today? I commend the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, for presenting a scientific analysis to the European Commission that clearly demonstrated how the most disadvantaged land was not receiving equal treatment under the current payment model.Indeed, I commend them for organising the public meetings throughout the country on this very important issue. This is an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and we in Sinn Féin will not let it pass. We saw what happened in the designations that were made and in the changes from REPS 4 where the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, promised an enhanced REPS to resounding applause in Castlebar but we got GLAS instead. GLAS is not REPS 4. We saw what was done to the single farm payment in 2000 and 2001 by colleagues on my left in Fianna Fáil in terms of the entitlements and everything else. Again, it was weighted against farmers in the west and farmers who are marginalised. I make no apology for fighting for farmers in Mayo and those along the western seaboard. The Minister wants to sustain the future viability of farmers. This is an opportunity to do it. We will work with the Minister and other genuinely interested parties to ensure this happens and that the wrongs of the past are righted under the ANC review.

There is €25 million of special money. I cannot see why people would exclude north-west Meath which has always been graded as severely disadvantaged. One is verging on marginal lands. Farmers are trying to keep lands going in areas like that and to keep them fertile and in use. No more than in many of the areas, it is mainly sheep on those lands. There is either a great deal of bog or a great deal of rock in these areas. From my point of view and in my experience as someone with a farming background, I cannot see how places like parts of north-west Meath and south Longford should be cut free and thrown to the wolves. It would be a very biased stance to take. I welcome the fact the Minister has engaged with us fully. He has certainly jigged things around in relation to our concerns. With the direction of our spokesman on this, Senator Paul Daly, who has excelled in his portfolio so far, we are happy to back the Minister.
#MauraHopkins	unknown-#MauraHopkins-party	unknown-#MauraHopkins-dob	unknown-#MauraHopkins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	245	I thank the Minister for coming to the House. As he has rightly pointed out, almost 100,000 farmers benefit currently from the areas of natural constraint scheme, which is very important. It recognises the difficulties associated with rearing animals on marginal land and attempts to provide a small level of support to ensure that land remains farmed and in a good agricultural condition. It also provides a welcome income support which is enormously important to farmers and their families. As we know, farmers in these areas must invest tremendous additional expense, effort and time to maintain stocking rates on land that is naturally constrained. As the Minister has pointed out, things are based very much now on the biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation around low temperature, dryness, excessive soil, moisture-limited soil drainage and so on. Maintaining a minimum stocking rate can be very difficult with these constraints. With the recent gorse fires, we must understand the importance of the ANC scheme to help farmers to continue to farm these areas for the benefit of our environment and our rural communities. As other representatives will be aware, many of the farming organisations have expressed concerns over recent months and emphasised the importance of the scheme in recognising issues and being fair. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh emphasised the point that the new scheme should include restrictions. I disagree absolutely with that. It is very important to maintain supports for the almost 100,000 farmers who are currently in receipt of that payment. They receive it for a reason. They have to farm in very difficult conditions and the evidence supports the provision of the scheme in a very fair way. That is what it should be. It should be fair and based on evidence. That is why we have the biophysical criteria now to justify and support it. We should not be restrictive. It should be there to support the almost 100,000 farmers who are in receipt of the payment at the moment.

I did not interrupt the Senator. Many farmers have contacted me, in particular from Roscommon and Galway, and expressed concern about clarity as the Department is publishing maps showing proposed designation and when consultation will take place. The Minister alluded to it in his contribution. It is very important the Minister encourages the Department to invest effort in communicating with the farming community and setting out a clear schedule for the process, starting with the date for the publishing of maps and the commencing of consultation. As the Minister said in his statement, Ireland supported an Austrian motion requesting that the refinement of EU regulations dealing with the rural development programme be deferred. It is important to do that because the review must be comprehensive, fair and thoroughly communicated to the agricultural community. I am aware that the Minister has said that if the Austrian motion is not accepted by the EU and we are obliged to conclude the process, it is critical that we are able to meet the deadline. I emphasise the importance of that additional €25 million commitment for the scheme within the programme for Government. The drastic cuts inflicted on farmers by the Fianna Fáil Government in 2009 were an awful blow to people on low incomes. It is really important that as the economy stabilises, every effort is made to restore funding for the scheme. I know the Minister wants to do that but it is important we see those increases for farmers who need them, in particular in the context of Brexit and the challenges to farming. The agricultural community will be the hardest hit as a result of Brexit. I thank the Minister for addressing the Seanad today and look forward to his reply to the debate.

Táimid ag teacht le chéile go minic na laethanta seo. The Minister and I meet fairly regularly these days in Dublin and in Galway. I am delighted that we are having this debate. It is good to have a debate on a specific area rather than a huge and broad one on agriculture or fisheries generally.I think it is good that we are having this debate. Senator Paul Daly said at the start of his contribution that Fianna Fáil wants to hear the full facts before it votes on the motion that is to be proposed by Sinn Féin. That is in stark contrast to what Deputy Ó Cuív has been saying in public meetings. He castigated me on Raidió na Gaeltachta by saying he fully understands this whole issue. He has said that he fully agrees with the motion that has been drawn up with the support of the Irish Natura And Hill Farmers Association and indeed that he would go further. There is certainly a contradiction in the line that is being taken by Fianna Fáil on this issue. It is great that we are having this debate so that members of Fianna Fáil can clarify where they stand on this issue.

This motion has been on the Order Paper for weeks. If the Fianna Fáil Senators knew the business of politics in these Houses at all, they could have tabled amendments at any stage. At least the Fine Gael line on this matter has been consistent. When Mairead McGuinness MEP attended a public meeting on this issue in Maam Cross, she made it quite clear that she would take a similar line to that taken by Senators Mulherin and Hopkins in this House this afternoon. She said she was open to extending the number of farmers to whom this scheme is open. She said she was not in favour of restraining the criteria in any way. That does not surprise us because Fine Gael is known as a party that supports the bigger farmers. At least it is consistent in the line it is taking.

Senator Paul Daly said that the most disadvantaged should get the most. I suggest that the disadvantaged are the only people who should get any payment. No one would suggest that everyone should get a disability payment regardless of his or her level of disability. Some people do not have a disadvantage. We would say that the payments under the scheme as it is presently constituted need to be refocused on those areas with a definite natural constraint. That is what we are proposing in our motion. We are asking for the retention of the mountain sheep grazing land as a separate category after the review of the areas of natural constraint. We also believe that payments should reflect the multiple biophysical and specific constraints experienced by farmers who farm mountain-type land. Those payments should be set at similar rates to the current offshore island rates. Maybe the Minister will share his thoughts on that one. Does he agree that such payments should be set at similar rates to the current offshore island rates? Everyone appears to be in agreement that mapping is an issue. There is a need for proper consultation in that regard. This is a very important issue. Many farmers in the areas we are talking about have been confused this week by the mixed messages coming from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to lands that have been the subject of fire damage payments under the basic payment scheme. I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide some clarification in this respect. What exactly is going to happen to such payments? Will they be affected? Many farmers whose land was burned went out to extinguish the fires themselves. In some cases, they received messages from the Government that they would be docked payments. That would certainly seem to be very unfair. The simple motion to which I have referred highlights the hypocrisy within Fianna Fáil, which really does not know where it stands on this issue. People like Deputies Ó Cuív and Calleary have said at public meetings that they wholeheartedly and fully support the motion, which has been written with the support of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association. However, when we proposed to bring the motion to the House and to ask for their political support in the place where we are supposed to do this type of work, Fianna Fáil accused us of shenanigans. It is all over the place on the motion. We welcome the clarification that has been received. We hope that when we get to put our motion on this to a vote, possibly next week, we will get the support of Fianna Fáil and possibly of Fine Gael and the Independents.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	265	I join others in welcoming the Minister to the House. I thank him for coming here to facilitate this debate. The commendable commitment and competence he has brought to his Ministry since he assumed office is widely recognised throughout the sector. I would like to focus on Cavan-Monaghan as a microcosm of the country as a whole and as a great exemplar when we are discussing the ANC scheme. As a result of the designation of both counties in their entirety as areas of natural constraint, payments of almost €9.5 million are made to farmers in County Cavan and payments of approximately €7.5 million are made to farmers in County Monaghan. The multiplier effect of those payments in local communities, in village shops and in the lives of people in these areas is crucial. This is not just about payments to farmers because this vital payment goes straight into the local economy. The topography of Cavan-Monaghan makes the land difficult. In many instances, the land is very sloped and very difficult to farm. That has to be a consideration. When I looked through the list of biophysical criteria, my humble opinion was that the Cavan-Monaghan area would qualify in each instance. It certainly qualifies under criteria like temperature, dryness, soil, shallow rooting, poor depth, poor chemical properties and steep slopes, etc. It qualifies right across the biophysical criteria. Sadly, it was similarly eligible under the original criteria. In my view, there are no question marks over the justice of all of Cavan-Monaghan being included. I am proud that my party was in government when that initially happened and I would be anxious for it to be maintained. The type of land we are talking about means it is very expensive to engage in activities like tunnel draining and reseeding. This can involve the reinvestment of almost all the farm income. The nature of the land requires farmers to spend a lot of money and to do a great deal of hard, physical work. When this work is done, it needs regular renewal and extensive upkeep. I emphasise to the Minister that when one engages in tunnel draining on one's land in an area like Cavan-Monaghan - this also applies to many other areas - that work needs to be redone, topped up and upgraded every so often. That is why it is expensive to maintain the land. If it looks well on day one, that does not mean it will look similarly well at a later stage, especially if money is not invested. In Cavan-Monaghan, climatic conditions and land and soil types make it necessary to store slurry and house cattle for a few weeks longer than in other parts of the country. That is an important consideration. As a general observation, we should not penalise enterprising farmers who do back-breaking work and reinvest all their available income to improve their land. If land appears improved and looks good on a given day, that is not a reason for exclusion. In fact, it is something that should be applauded and supported. The basic underlying condition of such land, as indeed set out in the criteria, should be recognised. These farmers should continue to be supported and their success should be seen as a success for the concept of ANCs. The extra cost of maintaining these improvements should be recognised. It is a reality that a large number of farms in Cavan-Monaghan would not be viable without this additional payment. Food production is supporting the maintenance of rural communities. I do not have to tell the Minister that there is a perennial debate about the drift to the east as part of the demographic shift in this country. We need to maintain our rural communities. I think the maintenance of the ANC scheme, which brings in enormous income, is critical in that regard. Senator Hopkins made an important point about the Brexit context to this debate. Like Senators Paul Daly and Mulherin, I have the privilege of being a member of the special Seanad committee on Brexit, which meets virtually every Thursday.We had representatives of the agrifood sector in last week. There were people from farming organisations, the food sector and so on and to a man and a woman, every one of them cited the huge difficulty Brexit presents for the sector, so the areas of natural constraint payments are critical in that context. The areas that are included should be maintained. I have a deep knowledge of Cavan, not Monaghan, and I stress that those areas should be maintained. I have no doubt that the case made for other areas is equally valid. The areas should be maintained because they have the underlying conditions. Insofar as one identifies improvements in spots, that is only a sign of the success of the scheme. Were it otherwise, the scheme would need more questioning than if it was being used for food production, the maintenance of family farms units and the support of our rural towns and communities. This is a critical scheme, and I am delighted the Minister is here to discuss it. I agree with Senator Ó Clochartaigh that it is welcome that we are focusing on something specific rather than making general remarks about agriculture as an important sector, which it is, but those general remarks are not necessarily as important. What is important is that we hone in on specific realities, and this is one. We must hold and maintain what we have already. I wish the Minister well in his effort to do that, but I could not agree more with the IFA people I met from Cavan-Monaghan, and the people who approach me all the time. That area depends on the payments, and the rural economy depends on it. Were that to be declassified, in addition to Brexit and all the other pressures that are coming on the rural communities, it would be a doomsday scenario that we cannot even contemplate.

Parents of children with life-limiting illnesses are meeting leaders of various political parties today and I had to be in attendance at the meeting. The Minister will appreciate why that would have kept me away until now. We need to be frank in this debate, so I will be frank. These payments were originally in Donegal and Connacht, and they were for the most disadvantaged farmers in the State. They were to be directed to those who most needed assistance to stay on the land. As the years moved on, it was widened out for political reasons and now covers 75% of the land mass of this State. One could not argue that many people in the areas in receipt were disadvantaged, certainly in comparison to the original areas that had been allocated. It got to the point where it was stretching credulity, and the purpose of the EU assistance, to the point where one could not stand over it. That has been the case for all these years. That is why I am pleased to see the emergence of farmers who are standing up for themselves and calling this out as it is, namely, that there needs to be a fair allocation to farmers who are genuinely in areas of natural constraint and genuinely disadvantaged by the topography and the conditions with which they work. The Minister can oversee a system that directs resources to those most in need, but he can also protect the interests of those who would be concerned about losing out. There is a way to strike that balance, and the Minister needs to do that in the time ahead. An additional €25 million will be added to the budget soon. He needs to take that opportunity to ensure that that €25 million goes to the most constrained areas. This is his chance to ensure that that additional €25 million, and all future funding, will be dealt with on that basis. For three weeks in a row we have put a motion before this House. It is based on the campaign of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, which is representative of an emerging group of farmers who are angry about their situation and are standing up for their rights. We salute them and encourage them in their work. Members present here today, and many other Oireachtas Members, have gone to public meetings attended by hundreds of farmers and assured them that they would defend their interests. They have assured the INHFA that they would support the objectives of its members' campaign, so we felt confident in putting the motion on the Order Paper. That motion remained on the Order Paper for an entire month. Everybody could see it. Everybody was aware of the issues. The first week we had to listen to the excuse that it caught people by surprise, that they wanted a debate and that it clashed with the agriculture committee, which was sitting at the same time. We did not believe that. In the second week we proposed that a debate would take place, that we would debate the motion afterwards and that it would not clash with the agriculture committee. Yet again, that was voted down. This week, we wanted that motion to be taken at the end of this debate when people had a chance to discuss all the issues. They argued that that was the only thing preventing them from supporting that motion and backing the campaign of the INHFA, and the new emerging farmers fighting for their rights in those areas. It was voted down again today. I will make it very clear for the Minister, and I am sure my colleagues have already done so. Now that he has had this debate and heard all the issues from his perspective, we will put the vote again next week. Let there be no doubt where people stand. As Sinn Féin representatives, we will not stand in front of a packed room of farmers concerned about their future, and concerned about fairness, tell them that we care about them and then do something very different when it comes to a vote. Our party is united in our perspective on this issue. We know that we will not please everybody. We know that some people will not want to hear our message, but we believe in fairness and sometimes, in trying to ensure fairness, there has to be an adjustment. In terms of that adjustment, the Minister should try to protect the interests of those who may lose a little, but in the interest of fairness we have to do what has to be done. I hope the Minister will encourage his colleagues here in the Seanad to support our motion, which will be put for the fourth time next week. We hope he has taken on board the concerns of the farmers the INHFA represents. I note that the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and other farming organisations are making commitments to move in that direction. I welcome that. It is important that as many farming organisations as possible acknowledge the injustice that so many farmers have faced, the lack of fairness in terms of payments and the fact that those payments did not reflect accurately the constraints and the realities in the way they were supposed to do at European level. A very wise comment was made at the public meeting in Donegal that sometimes we can be too cute or too smart for our own good in this country. If we are too cute for our own good in the way we interpret and implement the areas of natural constraint scheme, we could lose European funding if the way we allocate it does not achieve its objectives. I hope the Minister will not be too cute or too smart about this issue. He should do what is right and fair. We will put our motion again next week and trust that this fourth time it will finally be passed in this House.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	267	I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate, which has been informative. It is obvious that the contributions reflect the broad concern about how secure these payments are and an obligation to review the designation under a different set of criteria to those used previously when lands were categorised. Reference was made to the fact that over the years we increased the level of lands, as if that was a bad measure. I fundamentally disagree with that. A payment comes with the designation. The fact that under the criteria that applied at the time we were able to convince the European authorities, and I am learning quickly that that is not easily done because they are not easily convinced, of the merit of our case and that that delivered payments for farmers, irrespective of the shape or hue of the Government at the time, is something to be acknowledged as a good development in terms of getting payments to Irish farmers. The other point worth bearing in mind is that this scheme is co-funded by the European Union.The European Union pays 53% and the Irish Government pays 47%. With a scheme that currently delivers payments in the region of €205 million to farmers this year, please bear in mind that approximately €100 million of Exchequer funding is required. In respect of making a commitment, people have been unrealistic because they have commented on the scheme without referring to the overall financial constraints faced by the Government. I take issue with a fairytale view that has been expressed that there has been a significant underspend in the rural development programme. That view is not based on facts. The programme spans a five-year period and it is not neatly book-ended on either side. We are still paying, in respect of this rural development programme, for some of the schemes that people applied for during the last rural development programme. The next rural development programme will pay for some of the GLAS because people who apply today will get five years. It is not a neat 2015 to 2020 arrangement.  My Department has conducted studies on our commitments to a range of schemes that it operates under the rural development programme. Therefore, I know that there is no headroom to say that we can redesignate funds from one area to another to deliver a higher level of payment for any scheme be they the disadvantaged area scheme, areas of natural constraint or any other scheme. It simply is not the case. Plenty of people have said that we should pay €200 for suckler cows and increase the level of payments for different categories of disadvantage. To make serious and credible proposals requires one to address the economic side. There has been no underspend in the rural development programme and there is no crock of gold in my Department that would enable us to fund higher payments for disadvantaged areas. Yes, we have committed to, in our programme for Government, increasing disadvantaged areas payments by €25 million in 2018. I hope to deliver that funding in the context of budget 2018. It is something that will be in the overall melting pot of the negotiation process.  I accept the bona fides of everybody who has made a contribution. When one stands back from the politics of this matter I think everyone wants to ensure that those who benefit, and those who operate and farm under disadvantage by virtue of the lands they own, rent or whatever, get a payment commensurate with that situation. There is no land anywhere on the island of Ireland that is more disadvantaged than the islands off the coast of Ireland. That is why, specifically in the context of the renegotiation of the rural development programme 2015 to 2020, the islands received special recognition. I challenge anybody to argue to the contrary that no matter how disadvantaged one's lands are elsewhere on the island of Ireland, there is nobody farming under a greater disadvantage than island farmers. Whether they are on Tory Island, Achill Island, Sherkin Island, Lambay Island or any other island off the coast, they operate under specific disadvantages in terms of transporting their product by boat to the market on the mainland or, indeed, transporting inputs by boat from the mainland to their farms. There are specific disadvantages and for that reason the islands were specifically recognised. A Senator has argued that we should equalise the disadvantage that island farmers face with other categories such as mountain land. That would not be fair. It would not recognise the specific disadvantage encountered by island communities. Such disadvantage should attract a higher rate of payment.  In the context of the biophysical criteria and the fact that we are carrying out the review, consideration must be given to what the process throws up. It is my view that there will be tiered levels of payment but that will depend on the outcome of the assessment that uses biophysical criteria. I acknowledge and agree with the point made about farmers who, through the sweat of their brow and commitment over many years, improved their land. I personally do not think that such endeavour should work against them now. If one talks about the biophysical criteria, though they may have drained the land they did not change the soil structure, a fact I hope will be reflected in the outcome. The process was under way in my Department. In terms of our obligation, up to the point where we are now pursuing, along with other members states, an extension of the time involved by which time we must have this matter concluded, my Department worked on the assumption that we had to have this matter concluded by the time farmers applied for their basic payments in May 2018. A situation arose where Austria, at the Council of agriculture Ministers, asked for an extension of the period. The call was supported by a number of states, including Ireland. I believe that was prudent. I do not have a crystal ball that can tell me the outcome of the process. To use the old maxim of a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, I felt it would be better to adopt a policy of what we have we hold for the longest period possible and remove the uncertainty for the period that was within our control. I hope, while it has not been delivered in absolute detail yet, that the extension of time is forthcoming.  We have worked flat out to complete the process and that work will continue. I want to give a commitment that there will be an extensive engagement with the stakeholders who are the landowners and the affected communities, and Oireachtas colleagues. I have no problem in attending an Oireachtas committee meeting on this topic at a later stage.  The scheme is critically important. We should celebrate the fact that 95,000 farmers receive the payment. There are four categories. First, there is the island community. One will not find many people tillage farming on the islands off our coastline. Island farmers are the most disadvantaged and it is right that this fact is recognised by a higher payment. I appreciate that there are many hill farmers all over the country, particularly on the western seaboard and stretching from west Cork to Malin Head and Mizen Head. It is right that they are recognised. The two other categories are more severely handicapped lowland and less severely handicapped lowland. There is a tiered level of payments. Broadly speaking, the categories reflect the types of land in this country.  In terms of the overall budget, if we acceded to the proposal put forward then we would have to take €150 million from the €200 million of total funding and give it to the other categories. I could not be a party to the suggestion that mountainous land should be at the same level of disadvantage as islands. The proposal is unfair because island communities are at a specific disadvantage and that is why the payment is higher than that for anybody else. If one takes €150 million for two categories then one severely limits the amount of payments one can pay to the rest. It is right to have a tiered process, which will be reflected in the final outcome, but it is too early to say what that will be.  There are many farming communities on the western seaboard, along the line from Malin Head to Mizen Head, who do not farm on mountain-type lands. It is not a blanket area of disadvantage, of a uniform nature, because there are variations of disadvantage. It is right that the variations should be reflected in the final outcome and in the level of payment that people receive. That is something that I am committed to.  The payment is very important to farming communities. It is right and proper that we seek to deliver in this process, and this is something that I am committed to, the best possible outcome for the farming communities that reflects the level of disadvantage that each and every one of them operates under. The biophysical criteria frightens the farming community. I am reminded of the point that Senator Paul Daly made about his travels and his reference to the land around Macroom. I suggest that the next time he travels to Killarney races he takes more notice of the land around Macroom. Farmers in the region, as in every region, must cope with variations in the quality of land.One passes many furze bushes on one's way from Cork city to Killarney. Many farmers in the area are working marginal land. There are many farmers working fine land as well.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	269	I hope that the process of fine-tuning this scheme and engaging with the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development will reflect accurately the level of disadvantage being experienced by each community. Payments will then be tailored accordingly. I am committed to working with all stakeholders, including all farming organisations, towards that ambition. I believe everybody here aspires to this objective. While I do not want to trespass into the politics of this Chamber, I must say I think it would be unfortunate at this stage, when we do not have information on the specific level of disadvantage, to engage in political grandstanding on this issue. There will be plenty of time for that at a future stage. I take on board all of the points that have been offered in good faith. I will reflect on them and try to deliver the best possible outcome. It would be pointless to have a divisive debate on this issue now. All of our collective endeavours are needed on this issue to get the best result for farmers over the line.

In many of the cases in which farmers' lands were burned, it can be proven that this was not done by the farmers themselves. Nobody here or in my Department should have any truck with anyone who breaks the law. However, there is a burden of proof. It is right that Garda inquiries are ongoing in respect of high-profile cases in which extraordinary damage was done to property, homes, flora and fauna. I hope those inquiries can be concluded. Anyone who breaks the law should face the full rigours of the law. Anyone who is an accidental victim of such illegality should not face sanction in my Department.

As Senators will be aware, NAMA was established as part of the response to the banking crisis that arose in 2008. Its objective was to acquire loans from eligible banks, hold and manage these loans and related collateral and achieve the best financial return for the State by disposing of these assets expeditiously. NAMA acquired the loans for a total of €31.8 billion from the participating banks. NAMA's purchase was funded predominantly through €30.2 billion of Government-guaranteed senior NAMA bonds, which was a large contingent liability for the State. There was no doubt that the repayment of this debt would be extremely challenging and vitally important to improving the creditworthiness of the State. To be successful, NAMA would have to make important and commercially informed decisions at a time of great economic crisis. It is important to note that since 2010, against all expectations, NAMA has redeemed 98% of its senior debt, reducing the State's contingent liability from the original €30.2 billion to just €500 million today. NAMA expects to redeem the remaining €500 million in 2017 and ultimately to deliver a surplus of over €2 billion to the State. The full repayment of NAMA's debt, let alone returning a surplus to the State, was considered unthinkable by most people at NAMA's inception. NAMA's focus over the period from 2018 to 2020 will be on completing its objectives, including the delivery of office space in the Dublin docklands and much-needed housing. As Senators will know, in 2014, NAMA sold the Project Eagle portfolio to Cerberus, and issues around the sale subsequently became the subject of much media and political debate. In 2016, the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out an investigation into the sale to ascertain if NAMA had obtained the best achievable financial return for the State. In September 2016, the Comptroller and Auditor General published a special report which criticised elements of NAMA's performance. The Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that the decision to sell the loans at a minimum price of £1.3 billion involved a significant probable loss of up to £190 million in net present value terms; restrictions on the sales process, combined with the scope of Lazard's comfort letter, did not provide sufficient assurance that a different marketing strategy for the loans or a different timing of the sale could not have resulted in NAMA achieving a higher price from the sale of the loans; and allegations of the involvement of a member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee in an arrangement to share fees with law firms connected to the sale warranted more action by NAMA. Following publication of the report, NAMA indicated it fundamentally disagreed with many of the conclusions reached by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In March 2017, the Committee of Public Accounts published a report on NAMA's sale of Project Eagle which was completed following extensive public meetings at which many key witnesses gave evidence. The committee's report concluded that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was evidence-based, balanced and reasonable and that the Project Eagle sale was marked by inadequate record-keeping, weaknesses in the management of conflicts of interest, a seriously deficient sales process and, ultimately, an inability by NAMA to demonstrate that it had obtained best value for money for the State. The Committee of Public Accounts also welcomed the proposal to establish a commission of investigation. There has been extensive consultation with all parties in the Oireachtas since last September about the establishment of this commission of investigation. The Taoiseach met leaders of the Opposition on a number of occasions both before and after the Committee of Public Accounts report was published. At those meetings, all present acknowledged the limitations a commission of investigation will face, including that some of the alleged events took place outside the State, as well as ongoing criminal investigations. The Taoiseach also emphasised that it is unclear how much more information a commission may be able to provide beyond what the Committee of Public Accounts has already achieved. Nonetheless, in view of the consensus among Opposition representatives that a commission of investigation be established, and despite its likely cost, the Government has agreed to establish the commission. I am pleased to confirm that Mr. Justice John Cooke, a former High Court judge, has agreed to chair the commission. The Taoiseach has also consulted Opposition representatives on the terms of reference of the commission. The commission will, in the first module of its work, investigate NAMA's sale of Project Eagle. As agreed with Opposition representatives, it will be possible to amend the terms of reference, in accordance with the Commissions of Investigation Act, to provide for further modules at a future point. The commission is to investigate, having regard to NAMA's statutory obligations under the NAMA Act 2009 and appropriate commercial practice, the following: if the disposal strategy for its Northern Ireland loan portfolio, including the timing of the disposal and sale as a single portfolio, was appropriate in the circumstances; if the minimum price applied, and how it was derived, regarding its Northern Ireland loan portfolio were appropriate in the circumstances; if the management of the sales process by NAMA, including procedures and controls applied, timeframes, access to potential bidders and record-keeping, was appropriate in the circumstances and demonstrated best corporate governance; if any conflicts of interest arising in respect of members of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee were managed appropriately in the circumstances; when and how NAMA became aware of fees allegedly payable to a former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee by bidders on Project Eagle and if this issue was managed appropriately by NAMA during the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio; and if decisions and actions of the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance relating to the disposal of the Northern Ireland portfolio, including communications with members and officials of the Northern Ireland Executive and meetings with potential bidders, were appropriate in the circumstances. The commission shall avail of appropriate and independent commercial and financial expertise to inform its investigation. The commission will provide an interim report after three months and a final report by the end of June 2018, subject to section 6(6) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.The exact requirements of the commission will become clearer once the commission is established and begins to scope out its work in more detail. Based on an initial assessment and taking account of the cost estimate for the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, commission to investigate one transaction, an approximate cost of €10 million is proposed. This may be an overestimate if the commission does not suffer from the same level of third party costs and other challenges faced by the IBRC commission. It is important to note that this estimate refers to the proposed first module of the commission’s work relating to NAMA’s sale of Project Eagle only. There is a shared commitment among the Members of this House that the matters giving rise to public concern regarding NAMA are investigated thoroughly and effectively. I commend the motion to the House.
#GerryHorkan	unknown-#GerryHorkan-party	unknown-#GerryHorkan-dob	unknown-#GerryHorkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	274	I thank the Minister of State for joining us again in the House. He is getting quite used to being here on various matters. Fianna Fáil supports this motion and a commission of investigation into the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan book, known as Project Eagle. This was agreed by the Government last autumn and the commission of inquiry will be the responsibility of the Taoiseach, as it would obviously not be appropriate for the Department of Finance and its Minister to be responsible for investigating something in which they were involved from the start. We support the gradual and responsible winding down of NAMA, which will involve the paying off of the debt NAMA holds and returning a surplus to the taxpayer. That will involve the gradual and responsible selling of assets currently owned by NAMA. As we know, NAMA was established in 2009 to acquire impaired property loans from banks, protect or enhance the value of those assets and to dispose of them over time. In doing so, NAMA was required to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State. The figure of €74 billion is regularly mentioned in reference to NAMA but it would be unfair to say the €74 billion should have been recovered. Equally, if there is €74 billion in book value written down to €31 billion, with €32 billion being realised, there may be a theoretical surplus but it still results in a very significant loss to the State and, ultimately, to all of us. The Minister of State mentioned that NAMA issued debt amounting to €31.8 billion, of which €30.2 billion was senior debt and €1.6 billion was subordinated debt. That was guaranteed by the State. NAMA’s objective is to redeem senior debt in full by 2018 and up to the third quarter of 2016, €26.6 billion has been redeemed. It looks as if NAMA is on target to redeem its debts as issued of €31.8 billion, which is a definite positive, as people might have said at the time. It is great that it is going to exceed it somewhat. We all know assets were sold in 2012 and 2013 that were ultimately flipped for multiples of their value, so it is unfortunate that certain speculators managed to make the gain rather than the State. There was a particular office building in the Dublin docklands that was sold by the State for €13 million and then flipped a year or two years later for €100 million. It would have been preferable if NAMA had held on to the asset for a couple of years longer. Again, hindsight is wonderful. There have been issues with NAMA. People went through years of austerity in part because of the funding required for NAMA and as a result of the banking crisis. The extensive write-down of the debt from €74 billion left us with a big black hole that the taxpayers ultimately had to fill. This meant that taxes rose and services had to be cut to fill the gap. This cost came to approximately €60 billion and pushed Ireland into a bailout. Many of the issues were not restricted to NAMA and related to Government policy and specifically the way in which the Government failed to put in place adequate consumer protection when NAMA sold some of the loans to private vulture funds. It was only as late as 2015 that the Government responded to this and by that time, most of the loans had been sold to vulture funds and borrowers, homeowners and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, were left significantly exposed. Today, some 14,000 mortgage holders have their loans owned by unregulated entities and the Central Bank does not know how many SMEs have their loans owned by such unregulated entities. With many assets it is suggested that the Minister for Finance instructed NAMA to sell assets sooner rather than later. This direction meant that NAMA did not make as much money as it otherwise would have had. To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, denies ordering NAMA but admits to advising the agency. In his view, the sale of NAMA assets facilitated Ireland’s return to international markets. Ultimately, NAMA may have received more of a return if it waited but it would not have received the €74 billion. With Project Eagle there has been a significant loss and the Minister of State outlined much of it in his opening remarks. The sales process has been a matter of considerable debate involving the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and, ultimately, the Dáil and Seanad. There was a significant debate in the Dáil in March that was marred by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, questioning the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts, which distracted from the findings on Project Eagle. This attack revolved around Deputy Noonan’s own meeting with Cerberus on the eve of the closing bid date for Project Eagle and was unhelpful, to say the least, to the process. The report never suggested that Deputy Noonan influenced the sale but rather that it was procedurally inappropriate. This effectively means that it was ill-judged. Despite the fact that only two paragraphs of the 102-page report referred to the meetings, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, focused heavily on that point. There were also issues relating to advisers to the Northern Ireland advisory board of NAMA relating to Cerberus and PIMCO, along with certain individuals. We all know the topic involved and although I will not mention individual names, I have no doubt Mr. Justice Cooke will examine these issues. I wish all of those involved in the commission well in their efforts to get some answers to fundamental questions that remain outstanding. I welcome the report but it is important that when we consider any report and commission, we get a timely and efficient report. We want everything investigated accurately and properly. We do not want what we could have had in the past, with tribunals going on for 15 or 20 years and nobody ending up punished for actions if found not to have served the State well. I welcome the motion and my party will support it. I certainly hope the first module of this commission of investigation on Project Eagle will be satisfactory for the interests of all taxpayers and people in this State. If further modules are required, so be it, although I do not wish for it. I hope more issues are not uncovered, although the likelihood is there is a possibility of it happening.

It is difficult to see what the NAMA commission will find out that we do not already know. There are outstanding criminal inquiries into the matters relating to the commission, there is a Comptroller and Auditor General report and now this commission is proposing to do this work. This yet again tells us about the lack of absolute regulation when it comes to white collar crime and how to deal with it. We only need to refer to what we saw yesterday with the FitzPatrick trial. I will not go into that in detail. The public's confidence is at an all-time low with regard to commerce and business. People are disappointed. Sometimes we get caught up in this bubble around Leinster House but when we walk on the streets, the first thing people will ask is why we need another commission, paying another load of barristers, solicitors, experts and forensic accountants to tell us what we already know. We know the matter came before the Committee of Public Accounts, which is an exceptional body with an exceptional record. Why are we going around the houses? We know its findings and some people may not have been happy about them. We know the Minister for Finance was disappointed with aspects of it and what the Comptroller and Auditor General spoke about. There is much information out there but we are now going ahead with another commission of inquiry. I do not doubt the capacity to find a bit more information but that is what the public sees and what I try to bring here in my daily work. NAMA was established by Fianna Fáil and there was never any provision for freedom of information requests. That is a failure of politicians in here. That is not to single out Fianna Fáil but there was no attempt to insert a freedom of information provision. Where is the transparency and accountability?When this was established, those are the issues that should have been dealt with and taken on board, but they were not taken on board. I hope we will learn some lessons from them because that is important. The Minister of State dealt with Project Eagle in his report. We know that significant losses were incurred, and that is an area of concern. I will not go into the detail of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report; it is on record for anyone to see. We know what the Committee of Public Accounts had to say about it. In terms of what crystallises this issue, I draw attention to a statement issued by the Minister for Finance and his Department on 29 March 2017. He dealt with the criticism of him, as Minister for Finance, in that report. He addresses the issues in the report and goes on to state: "The Minute of the meeting with Cerberus is available ... [in his Department and is up on its] website ...". That is welcome and it throws some light on the matter. I had a look at that today and it raises a number of issues. The Minister goes on to state: "The meetings with Cerberus were not an area of concern in the C&AG report on Project Eagle published on the 5th August 2016." That is there for the record. He goes on to state: "I have stated consistently that I supported the work of NAMA. I have confidence that the Board of NAMA are achieving their commercial mandate in accordance with the NAMA Act." That is what the Minister told us. The most telling bit is where he sums up by stating:Before the Government makes a decision ... to proceed [with a commission] it will be important to hear the views of the members of PAC on a number of issues. In light of the extensive evidence [already] collected and ... [worked through and] completed [and before] ... the C&AG and the PAC and in the light of the ongoing investigations in multiple foreign jurisdictions it is important that Members in advising Government are able to answer the following questions:what would a Commission investigate?... [how] could a Commission add value beyond the work already completed?what could the Commission achieve in light of ongoing criminal and other investigations, and the fact that many potential witnesses and evidence are located outside the jurisdiction?how much might such a Commission cost and would that result in such a commission justifying the use of scarce budgetary resources?He goes on to talk about the corporate governance issues. That statement is available and I would advise people to have a read of it because it is very comprehensive, and I have only quoted some aspects.  We do not really have an option when it comes to supporting this commission going ahead but we have a hell of a lot of lessons to learn about how this was all set up before we even get to the commission. If this will give us more transparency and provide the public with greater reassurance, then we have to proceed with it, but it will involve a huge cost to the State. There is no point in us coming in here bellyaching in nine months about the costs and saying that we got it all wrong again. The bigger issue is how will we tackle potential white collar crime. How will we tidy up on the area of corporate governance and all the other issues? We have a duty at this point to go ahead with this and to have another investigation. For that reason, I will support it but with great reluctance because I am sure that in a year or two years we will back in here, if we are still here, saying there is nothing new to add but that we have we spent a fortune on lawyers, experts and specialists and we have done damn all for the money. If I was asked honestly today, with hand on heart, what I would do, I would accept that the Committee of Public Accounts has done work, that the Comptroller and Auditor General has done work and, having heard what the Minister has had to say, I would move on, learn from the mistakes and ensure they do not happen in the future. I am not sure if we should be spending this large volume of money. That is not to run away from the issue but I have addressed key points and I hope the Minister of State will respond to them.

I support this commission of investigation being established but I have one proviso. It is due to produce an interim report in three months. I do not want someone to come back saying that they need a further deferral. The critical point is that we need to have an interim report from the judge and the commission within three months. If the judge has a difficulty with resources, he should tell the Government now, not a day before the three months are up. This is about public trust. The Committee of Public Accounts produced the report and I believe an issue was missed in all of the discussion. The Comptroller and Auditor General had an issue with the procedure, which he queried as he did the corporate governance. That was the key to the report of the Committee of Public Accounts. That was rarely reported in the media, yet that was the key, and it never got the level of probity required. It was all about the value. The value is extremely important to the taxpayer, but it is about the procedure. I was in the other House the night the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was set up. I put through that legislation for Fine Gael. NAMA was set up for specific reasons, and they have been lost. NAMA was set up because the banks, in terms of their balance sheets, were effectively bankrupt. The taxpayer stepped in and effectively put more than €40 billion of taxpayers' money into NAMA. They took it on the hook. In terms of what was to spring from NAMA, it was supposed to take all the difficult development loans off the banks' balance sheets and allow credit to flow. That took a long time to happen. Getting the money back was to be a long-term project, not a short-term one. It was not supposed to be an asset disposal agency only. It was supposed to have a major social dividend. It has delivered on some of that, but it has not delivered on other aspects. We are where we are, and we look at the body of work that has been done by the Committee of Public Accounts. I know the Comptroller and Auditor General. I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for many years. It was about the procedures. The question is why the procedures were remiss. There is also the matter of how much it would cost the taxpayer. Those are the questions the ordinary person is asking. I want to bring this full circle. In the judgment delivered today in the case of Sean FitzPatrick in the Circuit Court, the jury was directed by the judge to give a not guilty verdict. The ordinary person is looking at that and, once again, they are being told by the judge that the reason for this was procedural. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement did not do its job properly. I am as mad as hell about that. I was thinking about it outside the perspective of a politician. How in the name of God did this happen? Some €30 billion of taxpayers' money has gone down a drain in Anglo. It is costing the ordinary taxpayer over €6,000 each. We now have a situation where there have been two trials. This current trial lasted 126 days. It will cost the taxpayer €3 million, apart from what it cost in terms of the investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. There must be accountability. How did this cock-up happen? Why are we hearing people say that files were shredded? How do we find that the witness statements were taken incorrectly? I remember when the issue came to hand. In layman's terms what happened was that two financial institutions, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, had different year ends. Anglo's year end was 30 September. That of Irish Nationwide was either November or December. Effectively, a director's loan was refinanced in a bed and breakfast transaction out of Anglo into Irish Nationwide for a two-week period, so it never appeared on Anglo's balance sheet. It was transferred back into Anglo within two weeks, so it never appeared on Irish Nationwide's balance sheet at year end. Those are the facts. It was €100 million at the end. It only came to light because at year end in September 2008, the director's loan balance had gone up sky high and questions were asked about that. The ordinary person looking into this is asking what happened. They want to know why they are picking up the paper and reading that a judge, having spent €3 million of our money carrying out an investigation in the courts on legal fees, and I cannot imagine what was spent by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, stated that there was bias in the way the investigation was carried out. The bottom line is that there is €30 billion of taxpayer's money on the hook for Anglo Irish Bank. The promissory note was great as it kicked debt off into the future, but my children and those of the ordinary man on the street will end up paying for it. The news came on the day when we were focused on the crisis in Manchester, which was absolutely horrific, given the loss of human lives. What we are discussing did not involve the loss of human lives directly, but how many people have come to the offices of public representatives who were being hounded by the banks have lost their homes and businesses? They are looking at what has happened and saying the organs of State did not work in their interests and that effectively an institution set up to look at white collar crime, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, did not do its job properly. People will lose trust in the legal mechanisms of the State as a result. There will be a delayed reaction because the judge made the announcement on the day we were focused on the tragic loss of life caused by a murderer at an event in Manchester. People have to be held accountable. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has to be held accountable for this major cock up at taxpayer's expense. We must become serious in tackling white collar crime. Regardless of whether Mr. FitzPatrick was guilty, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement should have done its job properly. This has been ongoing since 2012. After five years, it is not good enough. I am incensed and outraged that there has been such a cock-up when I see what people have had to go through since 2007. The arms of the law are seen as not having carried out their job. If in the circumstances Mr. FitzPatrick had been found guilty or not guilty, so be it, but the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement should have carried out its job properly. This is not rocket science; it is about preparing a case in the normal way. We must find out what happened in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the people must be held accountable.

Where does the buck stop? Who was in charge of the asylum? Did the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement have proper resources available to it? What were the checks and balances when it was set up? Accountability was pushed from one source to the other. Nobody is paying, except citizens. It is not an election we need but a revolution. I welcome the establishment of the commission of investigation and the fact that it received all party support in the Dáil last night. I also welcome the U-turn made by the Fianna Fail Party which only a year ago opposed its establishment because in its opinion it might impede a criminal investigation. The need for such a commission was as obvious 11 months ago as it is today. The decisions of NAMA have cost every citizen dearly; in the region of €250 billion will be lost by this State agency. A large number of citizen now realise the losses incurred were even larger owing to malpractice and inappropriate interference. I suggest it was public pressure and outrange that contributed to Fianna Fail's charge of heart on the matter. The work of the commission will impact on the State's ability to fight white collar crime. There is a need for legislation to be enacted quickly to implement any recommendation that might arise from the work of the commission.  This morning I addressed the anger felt by citizens as the trial judge had directed that one of those most closely associated with the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank should be found not guilty. Every citizen paid €6,000 to bail out Anglo Irish Bank. As a result of this and Government cutbacks, there are many people who are unable to get out of the bed in the morning, as the Taoiseach-in-waiting said. There are people who have lost home help hours or were forced out of work because they had to care for sick relatives. There is an absolute mismatch between the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar's public showboating in front of advertisements which target those who cheat the benefit system and the derisory resources given to bodies which combat corporate and company crime. The Minister claims there is a serious divide in Irish society between those who want to work and those who want everything for free. Yesterday it was laid bare that the most dangerous divide was actually between those who thought it was okay to defraud the State and its citizens of billions of euro and those who wanted to see it stopped. The commission of investigation should be seen as a test case on whether the State has learned anything from the collapse yesterday of the trial. In saying this I am not assuming that anybody is guilty or not guilty. I acknowledge the work of the Committee of Public Accounts. We, in Sinn Féin, always thought a commission of inquiry would be the best way of arriving at the truth. While the Committee of Public Accounts gathered and examined evidence, it did not have a mandate to attribute blame or to comment on the actions of certain State employees and politicians. I welcome the terms of reference, especially the fact that the sale of Project Eagle will be examined in the first module. I understand the role of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his Department in the disposal of the Northern portfolio will also be examined. We are clear that there was an inappropriate eve of sale meeting with the Minister for Finance before the sale of the Northern portfolio. I want to see the commission's work go unhindered and proceed as fast as possible. We have had many commissions of inquiry, yet we have a very poor record of getting to the root of problems. Speed is important. If the commission finds that there was inappropriate behaviour in sales, there will be a need for immediate action to be taken. The first module is due to take three months to complete and the first report will be issued in June 2018. As the investigation is ongoing, NAMA will be free to sell assets in whatever way it sees fit. There is no guarantee, therefore, that the dreadful mistakes made in the sale of Project Eagle which resulted in the loss of €191 million, as confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, will not be made again while the very is carrying out its work. I take the opportunity to thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his relentless pursuit of this issue, without which we might not be where we are today. Sinn Féin wants to see an immediate halt to NAMA sales. NAMA continues to hold assets both in bricks and mortar and land banks. Since the first motion to establish a commission of investigation was defeated, we have had the sale of Project Jewel. In many ways, we have no option but to have a commission of investigation. Any citizen who reads the newspapers or follows proceedings in the Houses of the Oireachtas knows that something is rotten. Despite repeated statements that the Minister for Finance did not instruct NAMA to effect a faster sale of assets, there has been no explanation of how such huge losses were incurred. Anybody with any civic responsibility would agree that this question cannot remain unanswered. The commission is long overdue and it is welcome that it will start its work immediately.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	278	I thank the Minister for coming to the House. I support the establishment of the commission of investigation, although I share some of the concerns expressed by others. It was very unfortunate that the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General which was clear was challenged in the way it was by a Minister and the Government. The Committee of Public Accounts also produced a very substantial report. While a commission is necessary to move to a situation where blame can be apportioned and concrete actions taken as a result of its work, we have to consider that time is passing. We are concerned that in the past ten weeks NAMA has sold another tranche of loans worth €2.5 billion. We know about Project Gem. We also know that large-scale sales of assets are happening under the same regime that surrounded Project Eagle and that they are proceeding apace. In the interim period, before June next year, how much of the remaining asset portfolio of the State will be disposed of?There is a question as to whether there should be a suspension of sales or, at the very minimum, a new regime of transparency associated with sales. Some of the elements of the terms of reference which I welcome include the fact that the commission of investigation will look at the question of whether both the timing of the sale and the disposal of the loans as a single portfolio were appropriate. There is a question around the NAMA practice of the large-scale bundling of portfolios and loans as sales, whether that is the most effective and appropriate way to dispose of these assets and whether it delivers the best and most meaningful return to the State.  The question of the social dividend has already been referred to by colleagues and in that context there is a problem with the way in which NAMA was set up. We had a great opportunity, when enormous amounts of property and other assets were transferred effectively into State control, to extract a social dividend but NAMA seems to have had a mandate simply to turn the assets around and get what it could from them over a period of time. Time was a driver in this and there is no sense that an adequate timescale was allowed to realise the best return. There are also questions around whether the social dividend might have been better, in terms, for example, of the role NAMA could and should have played in addressing our housing crisis. The manner of the setting up of NAMA meant that, coming out of a huge property bubble and crash, we again tied ourselves into a speculative model of property inflation. However, NAMA has not been operating in a bubble over the last two or three years. We have seen policies, such as the capital gains tax waiver, which have led to huge floods of vulture fund purchases. Such funds were effectively invited in. We have seen NAMA's assets turning over at a rapid rate to those capital rich vulture funds, attracted by massive tax incentives. We only need look to the sales figures and how they changed and jumped between 2012 and 2014 to see that. We must ask whether this was the best method to yield the best return and whether it was the best long-term strategic plan, not just for the cash profit that the State makes but also in terms of planning for our population and for a sustainable society with a sustainable property market that is not purely speculative. We see again commercial property continuing to be inflated and presumably that will be the case until it has been fully disposed of.  If NAMA has lost €190 million on the €4.5 billion Project Eagle transaction, how much has it lost on the €1.75 billion published since then? If it is a similar proportion, then the money spent on the commission will represent good value if it concretely contributes to us not having similar losses on the sales that are being made. Unfortunately, however, we have not seen any signal from the Government that it intends to ask NAMA to approach sales in a different way or that there will be greater rigour. I appreciate that the terms of reference include a caveat regarding confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, namely that they will only be respected where they are not incompatible with the public interest. Again, the opportunity to have freedom of information provisions available from the very start is an issue that can be examined. What are the Minister of State's views on freedom of information in areas where it does not currently apply because of commercial sensitivity? Will there be a change of approach in that regard, whereby we ensure far greater freedom of information access and transparency, even in areas where there is commercial sensitivity?  In 2014 the directors of NAMA came to the House and spoke about the €11 million which NAMA paid per year to 134 developers to manage their own portfolios. There are huge questions surrounding that. Section 4 of the terms of reference provides that the commission may also take up other issues which arise in the investigation. We may need to examine the appropriateness, procedurally, of having 134 developers who had gone into NAMA with debt, being paid €11 million by the State to manage their own assets at a time when home owners certainly did not have the luxury of buying down their own mortgage debt. The latter had to watch their debt being sold to vultures above them. There is public anger that those who caused or drove the property crash, which required around €40 billion of taxpayers' money, were living on wages of between €70,000 and €100,000. Those who had property portfolios, who declared themselves bankrupt, who went away for a year or two and then returned, are somehow millionaires again, as if by magic. We have seen how wealth disappeared and was regenerated while the general public carried the debt. We have seen the Quinns living on allowances which are 100 times beyond what the general population enjoys and we have seen the acquittal of Mr. Sean Fitzpatrick. There are so many procedural issues there, including the idea that in a white collar area, we do statements by committee as opposed to statements to the police. We have seen the shredding of documents. In that context, I again ask the Minister of State if there will be a new approach. We have seen a litany of incidents of the cutting, pasting and shredding of documents. There needs to be seriousness around white collar crime and there needs to be consequences. Interim action must be taken in the coming months, before the conclusion of this commission in June 2018, to demonstrate that we are taking a new approach. We have enough evidence now to know that we need to change our approach. I would like the Minister of State to outline what will be done in the immediate future in that regard.

It is clear that all Members of this House share the Government's desire to ensure that the NAMA commission of investigation conducts an effective investigation into matters of significant public concern. A number of issues were raised during the course of the debate which I will endeavour to address now. The issues of significant public concern that have arisen in relation to NAMA have been the subject of much media and political debate over the last while. Commentators from across the spectrum have aired their views on what may or should have happened regarding the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio by NAMA. I believe that the debate in the House today and the points that were made by all Senators largely reflect the constructive nature of the consultations between the Taoiseach and Opposition leaders over the past few months. Those consultations considered the limitations that will face a commission of investigation and the cost of operating such a commission. A number of Senators asked why a commission was being established. Quite simply, the Opposition parties believed it was necessary despite its limitations, which were made very clear by the Taoiseach at the time. The Taoiseach also made it very clear that it would be very costly. A number of Senators expressed concern about the potential costs involved, especially given the fact that we have reports from both the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General. They asked what more a commission of investigation could find out. I agree with the Taoiseach's assessment that this is going to cost millions of euro but I am not sure if it will find out any more than that found out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, in view of the consensus among Opposition parties, the Government agreed to proceed with a commission of investigation. The Committee of Public Accounts is also of the view that a commission of investigation is justified. The published terms of reference also reflect detailed consultations with Opposition representatives.

It is always a pleasure to have him come to the House. I thank him for his commitment to, and interest in, the Bill, which I understand he will not be opposing. I am very glad to hear that. I also thank the many organisations and individuals who have given support to the Bill and I hope we can look forward to support from colleagues on both sides of the House. I thank the trade unions, which have been hugely supportive, and have been campaigning in support, of the Bill. I mention IMPACT, SIPTU, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Irish Second Level Students Union, all of which have come out to support this important Bill. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017 seeks to address a glaring and ongoing gender inequality in Irish society, which is the inequality in pay levels between women and men. We call this the "gender pay gap", which is the term used to describe the difference between the pay of women and men calculated based on average difference in gross hourly earnings. In 2013, the European Commission published a major study on the gender pay gap across EU countries, noting that, on average, women in the EU earn about 16% less than men. There is a very wide range of disparity between women and men across different EU countries. This disparity remains the case despite the fact that women generally achieve higher level results at college and at school. Across Europe women represent 60% of university graduates and yet the impact of the gender pay gap over women's lifetimes means that they earn less over their careers, have lower pensions and are at greater risk of poverty when they retire. These figures tend to be borne out across international data. We know that the gender pay gap influences the career paths of women and may shape crucial decisions at each stage of our lives. Gender inequality in earnings will also impact into the future on our capacity to grow old comfortably. Where does Ireland feature in this? Our gender pay gap, according to European Commission figures from 2013 is 13.9%, almost 14%, which means that women currently earn 13.9% less than men. It is not the worst figure in the EU, nor is it anywhere near the best. It is better than the equivalent gap in our nearest neighbour in Britain, which will not for much longer be in the EU, but the gender pay gap there is 19.5%, a shocking figure. The figure of 13.9% still impacts significantly on women's careers and income levels here. To illustrate it in a more graphic way, the figure equates to women in full-time employment in Ireland working for free for about one month of every year. That perhaps illustrates better than any other figure the real impact of the pay gap on women's lives. We should remember that it is now more than 40 years since action was taken at EU level to address gender pay inequality. We in Ireland introduced our Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act in 1974, well over 40 years ago, following the introduction of EU pay equality directives and yet we are still seeing this persistent gender pay gap. Therefore, women have still not achieved anything close to income parity with our male colleagues. Why is this the case? A myriad of studies have examined reasons for this and the European Commission's work suggests a number of factors. There may still be cases where women are subjected to direct discrimination in the workplace and paid less per hour than their male counterparts doing the same job, but this is less common now because it is specifically prohibited under both EU and national legislation. However, there are ongoing structural problems, structural barriers to women's pay equality that impact at a less obvious or less overt level on women's pay equality. For example, we have a real problem with occupational gender segregation where women and men are concentrated in different roles and in different sectors. We know, for example, in the health and social work sector in the EU women make up 80% of the workforce. Sectors where women are particularly concentrated, therefore, often become feminised with the work in those sectors becoming undervalued, valued less highly than comparable work in different sectors predominantly carried out by men and, again, we have multiple examples of this. Women tend to bear a disproportionate burden of caring responsibilities in the home, in particular child care but also elder care responsibilities compared to male colleagues. This is often referred to as the phenomenon of the double day. Many of us are very familiar with that when we go home where we have caring responsibilities. That means that women are, therefore, less likely than men to work as long hours and that impacts not only on their earning capacity but on their promotional prospects in many workplaces. We see more women, therefore, concentrated in job-sharing arrangements or part-time employment. This has a knock-on effect. It means women are less likely to be promoted into senior management roles or to achieve promotions more generally in the workplace. Colleagues working in this area refer to this as the "sticky floor". There is not only a glass ceiling but women tend to be stuck on a sticky floor in many workplaces. Often we do not put ourselves forward for promotion because we may know it simply will not be compatible with other caring responsibilities. All these factors impact on differential pay rates for men and women when we average out pay across different sectors but the results are shocking. In the case of Ireland, a report done by Morgan McKinley in 2016 provides a detailed insight into how the gender pay gap impacts on the Irish labour market.It was a study of 5,500 professionals, men and women, in Ireland. It found the gender pay gap increases along with the educational level attained by women. Women achieve better results than men at college but the pay gap opens and worsens as women and men progress through their careers. While there was a pay gap of 22% between men and women with no degree, the pay gap increased to an unbelievable 28% for men and women with a PhD. The average earnings of a man with a PhD are €74,000 per annum while for a woman with a PhD, it is €53,500. For those with an executive MBA, the figure was even more stark in that a pay gap of 33% opens up between men and women with equal qualifications. The pay gap widens also with years of experience from a 12% gap, when women and men start out on their careers, up to five years' experience, to a 28% pay gap for women and men who have more than 15 years' experience. I have long had a passionate interest in women's equality in the workplace and some years ago I and some colleagues conducted an academic survey, funded by the Department of Justice, of women and men in the legal professions entitled, Gender inJustice, which found that while women outnumber men by a significant proportion in university law degrees, once they entered the workforce a gap opened up in terms of career prospects, income and promotion. We did a qualitative survey as well and when we asked why this was so the answer from men and women was that it is to do with children. The gap opens when women are most likely to have children, in their early to mid-30s, with men's career prospects accelerating and women's falling back. This is a real issue and there is a range of things to be done to tackle it. It has been highlighted and remarked on, not only by trade unions, equality advocates and the National Women's Council but also by major corporations, the World Economic Forum, which published a major report on the global gender gap in 2016, and by multinational corporations, such as Unilever, that women's underemployment and lower income levels have a seriously detrimental effect on world economic growth. There are very sound commercial reasons to address the gender pay gap too, and the Morgan McKinley report illustrates that. There is a range of initiatives that need to be taken to deal with this ongoing inequality, in particular initiatives to strengthen supports for women returning to work after having children, and to support men taking time off work, such as paid parental leave. I am delighted that at last we have paid paternity leave in Ireland. It was a Labour Party initiative, whatever the Minister of State's colleagues may claim, but one which needs to be expanded on. I know he has not made any claims. Most men of my generation and younger wish to take on more caring responsibilities outside the home and we need to make sure the workplace supports are available for them to do so.  There are key ways to tackle gender pay inequality. Apart from the big picture of child care and parental leave, we need to examine the legislation introduced in other EU countries which has proved effective in tackling gender pay gaps. This, in particular, is what our Bill seeks to do. It takes a carrot, not a big stick approach, to empower the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to administer a pay reporting mechanism. This would require companies or organisations with more than 50 employees to publish the difference in the rates they pay to men and women employees, in effect to conduct an audit of their pay scales to establish whether a gender pay gap exists. It is a carrot because it is enabling legislation. It would facilitate the publication of these figures and enable companies to address what they may not even be aware of, that there is, in fact, a gap in pay between the men and women they employ. We also seek in the legislation to require employers to publish details of bonus pay and the Morgan McKinley report found the bonus gap is as much as 50%. There are several different levels of pay disparity that need to be addressed. The key aspect of the Bill is to ensure transparency in pay rates, to ensure that we can highlight any gender pay gap that exists. It is not enough to hope organisations will volunteer this information but we have seen similar legislation prove effective in Belgium, one of the first countries to introduce it, where there is now a pay gap of just under 7%, half our gap. Iceland, Australia and Germany have introduced similar legislation and closer to us, Britain has recently implemented gender pay gap reporting with new regulations, as the Minister of State is probably aware, requiring companies with 250 or more staff to record annually how much they pay men and women. Our legislation, which is also based on a commitment in the current programme for Government, seeks to implement recommendations from the EU Commission, Morgan McKinley and a range of other international bodies, such as the World Economic Forum, to ensure we have greater transparency in pay rates and to enable companies, working with IHREC, to address pay disparity where it exists, to draw up action plans to tackle pay disparity and to begin to close the gender pay gap. The World Economic Forum has estimated it will take up to 170 years for the gap to close fully if we do not do anything. Inaction is no longer desirable. We need to ensure positive action is taken, as we did with gender quotas in the political sphere and we saw the impact that had on the numbers of women elected in the last election. This important and progressive legislation will also be most effective in tackling the ongoing pay inequality between women and men. 
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	282	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017, proposed by Senators Bacik, Humphreys, Ó Ríordáin and Nash. Senators will be pleased to hear that the Government will not oppose the Bill. While the Bill is relatively short, it proposes to amend the legislation establishing the IHREC, by assigning to the IHREC powers to make mandatory information disclosure schemes. Under such schemes, specified categories of employers would be required to compile and publish information relating to differences in the pay of their male and female employees. Contravention by an employer of the provisions of a scheme would be an offence. Schemes would not apply to employers with fewer than 50 employees. I acknowledge the good intentions behind the Bill, the general thrust of which I support in terms of its objectives and the need to address the gender pay gap. As the Senators are aware, it echoes specific commitments in this regard in the current programme for Government which Senator Bacik has just acknowledged.  The principle of equal pay for women and men for equal work, or work of equal value, has been part of Irish law for almost 40 years and is part of everyone's contract of employment. The gender pay gap, the difference between the average gross earnings of female and male employees, is not as well understood. In 2014 the pay gap between women and men employed in Ireland was 13.9%, before any adjustments are made to take into account of factors such as differences in education, labour market experience, hours worked, type of job, etc. Among the many factors which interact in creating the pay gap, a number have an obvious gender dimension. I refer here to traditional role models, gender segregation in education and in the labour market, the challenges of balancing work and family life, the difference in participation of men and women in family responsibilities, the availability of quality, affordable child care facilities and out-of-school hours care, and processes within organisations where imbalance needs to be addressed. The Senator has already commented on most of those. To put the situation in Ireland in a broader context, it should be noted that Ireland is one of the better performers in the EU. While the gender pay gap across the EU overall was 16.7% in 2014, the gender pay gap in Ireland at 13.9% was the lowest in the EU. I fully accept that this is not where we want to be and that we need to act on the gender pay gap. This objective is articulated both in A Programme for a Partnership Government and in the actions of the new national strategy for women and girls. I have left copies of that in the ante room if Senators want to take copies away. There are specific actions in it with respect to this issue. I want to highlight, in particular, the importance the Government and I attach to taking action to promote wage transparency, as a means by which some of the factors contributing to the gender pay gap can be identified. This is expressed as a specific commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to introduce wage surveys for companies of 50 or more employees. Therefore, I am not opposed in principle to the Bill. However, I have concerns with the specific approach proposed. Before going into detail on the provisions in the Bill, it is important to mention the national strategy for women and girls 2017-2020, which the Tánaiste and I launched on 3 May 2017, and which specifies a package of actions to deliver on this programme for Government commitment. Action 1.22 of the strategy will initiate dialogue between key stakeholders, unions and employers, aimed at addressing the gender pay gap, and develop and promote practical information resources to explain and increase understanding of the multifaceted aspects of the gender pay gap and its causes.Practical tools will be developed to assist employers in calculating the gender pay gap within their organisations and consider its aspects and causes, mindful of obligations regarding privacy and data protection. Furthermore, action 1.23 pledges to promote wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results. Beginning with the purpose of the Private Members' Bill, I note that the explanatory memorandum identifies three uses for the information to be published by employers who come within the scope of a scheme. The primary purpose is to provide information to diagnose the causes of the gender pay gap in organisations to inform the formation of public policy. I assume this would require the compilation and analysis of responses from all employers within a scheme and for such analysis to be available to the Government for policy formation. The second use is by employers, providing them with a means of benchmarking their gender pay gap against that of their competitors. I note that this would require employers' information to be publicly available. The third use is by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. A scheme would provide it with an additional source of information on differences in the pay of male and female workers employed by an organisation. Such information could inform a decision by the commission to use its existing powers to invite employers to carry out equality reviews and prepare and implement action plans. It could also inform a decision by the commission to carry out such equality reviews and action plans on its own initiative or to initiate inquiries. Turning to the Bill, section 1 provides for the insertion of a new section 32A into Part 3 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 which sets out enforcement and compliance procedures involving the IHREC. Subsection (1) provides for the making of a scheme by the commission. As set out in the subsection, the exercise of any authority or power to make a scheme would be at the sole discretion of the commission. There is no provision under which the Minister may require or request the commission to make a scheme. As such, there is no provision made whereby enactment of this legislation is guaranteed to result in the introduction of wage surveys, as promised in A Programme for a Partnership Government, or within the timescale envisaged in the new national strategy for women and girls. Also, the commission is fully independent and must be able to determine its own work priorities. The imposition of such an obligation raises the possibility that it may not be in a position or be the most appropriate body in this context to carry out such a task. As subsection (1) is phrased, approval of the Minister is not required for any such scheme. While the IHREC has undoubted expertise in this area, it may be appropriate that powers are subject to the control of the Minister, as is the case with section 31 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, whereby codes of practice can be prepared by the commission for submission to the Minister and the Minister may, by order, approve them. There is no similar mechanism in the Bill. While subsection (3) provides an indicative list of matters that may be prescribed in a scheme and subsections (4) and (5) specify the minimum information that must be published by an employer under any scheme, terms and concepts are used which are ambiguous or not defined in this context. For example, bonus pay, pay quartiles, breakdowns by reference to employees' ages and breakdowns by part-time and full-time status are all terms to be defined. The Bill proposes in subsection (6) to create a new offence of contravention of the provisions of a scheme by an employer. The imposition of a class A fine for this offence appears to be out of line with other offences under the IHREC Act 2014 which are liable for class C fines. With the level of information the Bill requires to be published, there is a danger that the pay of some individuals could be ascertained. For example, would it be possible for such information to be identified from the publication of the proportions of men and women in the different quartile pay bands? If only one or a few men or women were in a particular band, this could be possible and it obviously raises data protection concerns. Subsection (5) requires the information specified in subsection (4), paragraphs (a) to (f), to be further disaggregated by reference to age and employees' part-time or full-time working status. This level of disaggregation increases the likelihood that an individual employee's pay would be identifiable, even in respect of employees of larger employers. The State's legitimate interest in increasing wage transparency in order to provide information on gender pay differentials within individual companies must be balanced against the rights of individual employees to privacy on pay. The one-size-fits-all approach set out in subsections (4) and (5) gives me cause for concern. The case for making this information publicly available in respect of all employers, irrespective of the size of their workforce, requires careful consideration and must be examined to ensure it is proportionate and necessary. A more nuanced approach may be needed. The Bill appears to draw selectively from recently introduced UK legislation, namely, the Equality Act 2010 and Regulation 2017, No. 172, which require employers with 250 or more employees to publish similar information on differences in the pay of male and of female employees, on which there was extensive public consultation, informed by regulatory impact analysis. The aspects of the UK model incorporated into this Bill are subsections (1) and (3) to (5), inclusive, which are similar to provisions of section 78 of the UK Equality Act 2010, while subsection (4) is similar to paragraph 2 of Regulation 2017, No. 172. It is notable that subsection (5) which requires the breakdown of information by reference to the full-time or part-time status of employees and their ages and which raises data protection issues is a level of detail not provided for under the UK law. These are my comments on the provisions of the Bill. More fundamental than these views, however, is my concern that we should not enact legislation in this area without having full consultations first with interested stakeholders, in particular employers and trade unions. We need to ensure the legislation asks for the right information, that it is reported in the most efficient and useful manner and that it will produce the best indicators for future policy directions, not only for national policy but, crucially, also to support analysis and inform change where it is most needed at the level of the individual employer. Consultation will allow for an assessment of the full range of approaches to the design and implementation of wage surveys. I very much welcome the debate and I am listening carefully to what everyone is saying. The Government is open to and readily welcomes debate on the issues the Bill aims to address. The Government is committed to acting on the gender pay gap. Unfortunately, I will have to leave shortly, but the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, will be able to hear the rest of the debate. I will check what colleagues had to say later. I hope to engage further on the Bill.

I congratulate my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, on the work she has done on this issue and her campaigning for many years to raise issues of gender inequality in many spheres. In fact, we had a discussion on this issue only last night in respect of broadcasting. As somebody whose own mother was forced to leave her employment when she got married in the late 1960s and as somebody who taught in an all-girls school, it is remarkable that we have moved a long way in such a period. Often, however, when talk turns to issues of gender equality, there can be a little disinterest and an assumption that everything is okay in this country. This is aside from issues associated with the health sphere, on which I know we will touch again, and the constitutional impediments affecting women's health. In the work sphere, however, it can be assumed that all is well, but that is certainly not the case. When my party was most recently in government, we sought to address this matter in a number of ways. One of the issues we tackled, in respect of which Ms Kathleen Lynch was very forthright, was that of having gender equality requirements for State boards, with a minimum percentage of female participation. It was not a question of a general statistic but one across all types of board. It was not good enough to have 90% male representation on financial boards and 90% female participation on child care-type boards; there had to be a gender balance on all boards. In Germany the authorities have legislated for gender equality on commercial and state boards. Perhaps we might look for this in the future. Just as Senator Ivana Bacik has done in this Bill, it is important to start with the carrot and work with employers and unions to ensure all jof these measures can be addressed properly. When we were in government, we were trying to ensure a legislative basis for the protection of workers' rights in the low-pay sector. Women are disproportionately affected in this and other vulnerable sectors. It is they who work in these areas. When we were defending the joint labour committee and the employment regulation order system and establishing the Low Pay Commission and increasing the minimum wage, we noted that a disproportionate number of women worked in the affected sectors. That is why the conversation we had, the measures implemented and the concept of having decency underpin the economy were so important. We need, however, to go further constantly and work harder. We still have a very gender-based education system. Whenever I talk about gender inequality, I talk about this issue. It is one we really need to grasp. At primary and secondary levels in many parts of the country - it may be more of an urban than a rural phenomenon - we are still quite comfortable with gender-based schooling. We separate children on the basis of gender, even at the age of four years. I acknowledge that there probably has not been sanction for a single-gender school since the 1980s, but we still need to have a national conversation about this issue. While we are happy to talk about gender equality in adulthood, we are not necessarily as happy to discuss what is blatantly and glaringly obvious to many in many communities, namely, the separation of children on the basis of gender, particularly at primary level.Now we have to have a national conversation about this. While we are happy to talk about gender equality in adulthood, we are not necessarily as happy to discuss what is blatantly obvious to many people in many communities, that is, why we are separating children, particularly at primary level. At second level that conversation can be more difficult. People point to supposedly reputable surveys about the performance level of boys versus girls at second level, research that has been largely discredited. One would wonder why we have such a gender obsession when it comes to the Irish education system, which inevitably leads to gender stereotyping and to a certain type of gender-related subject choices that has a knock-on effect on the workplace.  I understand the Minister has to leave but I thank him for his attention. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to the House. All these issues are interrelated and while we cannot grasp them all at once, we need a huge amount of buy-in across many Departments and sectors in order to really hammer this home. I have mentioned vulnerable work and the education sector. When we were in government, we organised a conference around the issue of gender equality in the workplace and even at that conference there were those male executives who were still scratching their heads and wondering what the big deal was. It was not something that they actually considered a real issue. It is, however, and if we are going to address it, as we are trying to do with this Bill, it is important to be as inclusive and as non-accusatory as possible in the early stages. We need to use a collaborative approach, encouraging rather than sanctioning. I suggest to the Minister that if there comes a stage where companies are not playing ball or not seen to be embracing this new initiative, he may have to use the stick. The workplace is so important to somebody's identity and when I was a Minister of State we dealt with the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and we tried to ensure that workplaces were LGBT-friendly. What eventually happened was that the corporate world discovered that the productivity of workers would be better if they had a more equality-based outlook when it came to dealing with their employees. Surprise, surprise, there actually is a cold, capitalist argument for equality. Senator Bacik and I would never have assumed that would be the case but we have learned many things along the way. When dealing with corporations, the business sector, business leaders and employers, there is a strong argument to be made about productivity and about happiness in the workplace in terms of addressing issues of gender pay gaps. That is what the Bill is attempting to do, bringing in an agency of the State to ensure that the gender pay gap is addressed. It has been attempted in other jurisdictions, as has been outlined, and it has been successful. While we appreciate the Government is not opposing the Bill, we were slightly disappointed by the Minister's speech, which pointed out the number of difficulties the Government has with it. That is okay, however. We can work together to iron out these things and we can move forward together in a collaborative fashion. Gender equality is a real issue in every workplace and in every facet of Irish society and Senator Bacik and the Labour Party group are bringing forward practical, reasonable and sustainable measures that will make a difference in the long run.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	284	I would like to welcome my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to the House. I would like to salute the Labour Party and Senator Bacik, in particular, for what I would describe as very progressive and necessary legislation. The Labour Party has a proud history in social justice issues, in particular in this area, and it is appropriate this is acknowledged. Information is power. The more information that is available, the better equipped we are as a country to do the right thing. I am very pleased the Government is not opposing this Bill on Second Stage. I sincerely hope that whatever the technical issues are, they can be resolved by the Minister and Senator Bacik in a collaborative way and that the legislation will be even more powerful as a result. A Programme for a Partnership Government is very strong in this area. The objectives and aims of the Government and Senator Bacik are really the same; it is just a matter of how we achieve them and do this properly. This Bill will pass Second Stage this evening, so that will put a particular process in train that will ultimately bring us to where we want to go.  Much has happened I listened to Senator Ó Ríordáin talking about his mother having to give up her job when she got married in the 1970s. If one tells people about that today, they do not believe it. We have come a long way in four decades but we have an awfully long way to go. There is the issue of equality but then there is real equality. The vast majority of people aspire to equality. Unfortunately the word "equality" is kicked around an awful lot and, in many ways, it is abused. What I want to see is real and meaningful equality. What the Labour Party and, indeed, the Government are trying to achieve is real equality. It is equality where nobody is working for a month out of every year for nothing and where people are effectively equal in all aspects of their work.  I was not in the House for the Order of Business this morning but I believe the Fine Gael leadership issue was brought up. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has suggested extending parental leave. There should be the option of dividing up maternity leave if somebody-----

#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	287	If somebody wishes to do three months and the other partner in the relationship wishes to take three months, we as a society and as a Government should be able to facilitate that because it is correct that the vast majority of modern fathers want to play an active role in the raising of their children. This should not be a major difficulty. There maternity leave period is six months and there should be options there. This is a proposal that I heard made in the last couple of days and I welcome it. We have moved into a far better space in this country when it comes to equality but we need to keep moving into the space, to embrace and believe it. The situation in schools needs to change and I concur with all the points Senator Ó Ríordáin articulated in that regard. The private sector has much to do as well. Not enough is being done in this regard. If the private sector was to embrace this issue of absolute equality, it would be amazing how skilled and fulfilled a workforce there would be. As we head into what hopefully will be a period of growth in our economy, I want to see all citizens with a skill set having that skill set not just properly recognised but properly remunerated. Some 84% of blind and visually-impaired people between the ages of 18 and 64 in this country are unemployed, whereas the European average is approximately 40%. The whole issue of equality is a broad church and this legislation, when it gets over the line, will certainly help in terms of gathering factual statistics and ensuring that those statistics can then be used to change public policy, to change a mindset and to highlight the obvious inequalities that exist. I welcome the legislation and I am glad the Government is not opposing it.

I am glad to report that Fianna Fáil will support the Bill, which requires certain employers to publish information on the pay of their employees for the purpose of showing that there is no difference in the pay of male and female employees and that if there is, they have to give a reason. The fact that we are discussing this subject and that Senator Bacik felt the need to introduce the Bill highlights clearly that more needs to be done in this area. I hope that, whatever form the regulation comes in, it will not put too much of an additional burden on employers. As Members here would know, approximately 3,000 large and medium-sized enterprise employers employ about 700,000 people. It is important, therefore, that whatever regulation is introduced, and it is much needed, is done in as simplistic a fashion as possible. It was interesting to learn, while doing research for this discussion, that our situation has deteriorated in recent years. I am not sure whether Senator Bacik can enlighten us as to the reason for that. In 2012, the gap was as low as 8.3% but, unfortunately, according to the OECD, the most recent indicator indicates that the gap is now approximately 16%. That is strange, and I would welcome Senator Bacik's comments on the reason that might be the case. Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government committed to a range of measures to reduce the gender pay gap such as increasing investment in child care and providing locally delivered courses to facilitate women who want to return to work. While those measures are welcome, it is clearly not enough. We can see from data available that there is a gender gap not just regarding pay but for women who try to get promoted to different areas. In boardrooms, for example, the percentage of women compared to their male counterparts is very disappointing. More work needs to be done in that regard. As Senator Bacik outlined, women with similar qualifications to men, even in the legal profession, do not seem to get the same remuneration for their work. That is strange because I am sure they are more than capable of doing as good a job, if not better, than their male counterparts. I am delighted that Fianna Fáil is supporting the Bill. I compliment the proposers of it because it is a sensible measure to try to come up with a solution to this problem. They are using a softly, softly approach, which I hope employers will embrace, and I congratulate Senator Bacik on that. I hope that when we review this legislation, whenever it comes up for review, we will see clearly that it is working. When it becomes law, I am sure the Bill will address the issue we all want to see addressed, that is, the pay gap between female and male employees.

I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak to this Bill. The perspective I am coming from is that I believe we should work increasingly for the introduction of family-friendly work practices in our society as well as flexible working arrangements such as flexi-start and finish, which enables women in particular to combine being a parent without sacrificing the level of their career, but also allows men to take on more of a co-parenting role. This Bill is something different, however, and I believe it goes the wrong way in many ways. Senator Bacik and her colleagues want to determine if there are differences in the pay of male and female workers and the nature and scale of such differences, and create a power for the Human Rights and Equality Commission to compel employers to disclose information on the gender pay gap, if any, in its operations. It is presented as a diagnostic rather than a curative measure to enable information to be gathered, but the Human Rights and Equality Commission may command an equality review. It may prepare and implement an equality action plan, and it would be an offence not to implement the requirements of such a plan. It is a little more than information gathering. Why not ask the Central Statistics Office to carry out an exercise gathering payment information? This Bill is more of a fishing exercise designed to trawl up data for advocacy purposes and to advance a discredited analysis of earnings as opposed to pay differences between the sexes. We have employment equality legislation, which rightly makes it illegal not to provide for equal pay for like work or to discriminate on the basis of gender. The problem is that there is no clear regulatory purpose to this Bill. Because we have the law that prohibits discrimination, there is no role here for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act and the creation of new offences In law for failure to comply what I said was a burdensome fishing exercise. In a company there can be differences in earnings between men and women, young employees and older employees and employees with degrees and those with experience. If it can be explained by discrimination due to age, race, gender and so on, there is then a legal avenue. The unjust differences are already guarded against in law, and that is right and proper. This Bill comes from the premise that gender is the reason for gaps in remuneration. It should be noted, however, that according to the World Economic Forum, Ireland was the fifth most equal country in the world out of 145 countries. Male and female educational attainment in third level was virtually identical, with the only difference being that women were scoring higher in completion rates. Again, it is about an agenda distorting the real reasons for an earnings gap to advance a false narrative. When one factors in time in the workplace, experience, chosen career and length of service, the earnings gap closes to a very low level. The UK Office for National Statistics found in 2014 that men earn more in their teenage years, but that women are paid more between the ages of 22 and 29. The origin for the proposals in this report seems to arise from a 2016 document published by Morgan McKinley. It suggests that the gender pay gap actually widens against women with years of experience from 12% through to 28% where they have more than 15 years experience, but then they contradict themselves later. Showing that where women have greater experience in a job they earn more than men, and that is right and proper. Dr. Catherine Hakim of the London School of Economics criticised the flawed thinking behind calls for further equality legislation in the UK by showing that experience is what is crucial for remuneration. That is borne out by the UK office I quoted earlier. It is interesting to note in this regard that even the feminist utopia of Sweden, despite all its family-friendly and equal opportunity policies, does not have a better record than Anglo-Saxon countries in terms of eliminating sex differences in the labour market. It is necessary to reiterate that there are two distinct issues that must be discussed regarding the pay gap: the unadjusted versus the adjusted pay gap. An adjusted pay gap takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience. This Bill does not attempt to undertake such a practical analysis, nor does it proceed from same. I note with sadness that it is often the case that some feminists dismiss the idea that mothers choose to reduce hours or go part-time as structural inequality. If women make a decision they approve of they are empowered, but if they make a decision that is not liked, it is cultural expectations or structural inequality that is to blame. However, some of these people would hold personal choice as the highest goal. For example, the choice to end the life of an unborn child is not due to any structural "whatsits". Women involved should not be encouraged in any way socially or assisted formally and publicly to make a better choice or even the identification of a better choice. Everything is neutral on that issue, yet there is a clear agenda to promote certain goals on this issue. I do not understand the disparity in that thinking. If anything, what the gender pay gap proves is that even after 40 years of relentless propaganda, in many cases women still prioritise caring responsibilities over career and pay. In that vein, the specific reference in Article 41.2.1o to the role of women in the home, and to mothers' duties in the home, has given rise to criticism. I would support making that provision gender neutral, but I do not support any attack on the value of parenting in our society.We must not confuse equality of opportunity with equality of outcome. We should not restrict or interfere with people's family or personal decisions about work. If that leads to gaps in overall earnings, that are rooted in the exercise of choice, that is fine as long as people are treated fairly in the work that they do. Many women choose to interrupt their careers to care for children. We should not deprecate that choice. We should make it easier for them to return to work if necessary, but sadly, this burdensome Bill is not about that.

I strongly support Senator Bacik's Bill and the ideas that lie behind it. It seems to me that if we were talking about any other categorisation of citizens, such as colour, religion or whatever, there would not be any argument at all about such a provision. When it comes to gender, we are told that in that context, there are reasons why inequality is explicable. I fully accept that there are social and demographic reasons whereby some women will opt in or out of the workforce on a different basis compared to men. It strikes me that this legislation is well capable of taking those matters into account. I want to express disappointment that the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, came in here and said, effectively, that this required consultation. This Government has been in office for a little over a year yet it has not started the consultation process. It is already in the latter half of its probable existence. When is all this going to happen? It is very easy to come into this House and say that one will not oppose a Bill, especially if one does not propose doing anything further about it. I believe that there is a very strong case for having factual information made available by large-scale employers in Ireland so that the onus is on them and a culture is created of requiring them to be equal in their pay policies towards women. The factors that Senator Mullen has referred to can easily be taken into account but do not justify the maintenance of an unequal payroll outcome in society.
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	296	I commend Senator Ivana Bacik and the other Labour Senators for their work in this area. There are numerous complex reasons, as other speakers have alluded to, as to why a gender pay gap exists, not only in Ireland but all over the world. One reason is that women are, in some cases, paid a lower hourly wage than men. Another is that a significant portion of women may not return to work full-time once they have children and it is a biological reality that women have to have the children until something changes drastically with the human race. The combination of women working fewer hours on average than men over their lifetime and the lower hourly wages for women results in lower pensions, which is a bigger issue in many senses because many women experience poverty in old age. Ireland currently ranks 25th out of 33 in the women in work world league table. There is clearly room for serious improvement here. However, Ireland ranks above some of our European neighbours, which is some comfort, but to think that we rank ahead of Italy, Spain and Greece is a small comfort in many ways. Ireland has also seen positive change as the gender pay gap has decreased somewhat in the last 11 years. As I said, serious further improvement is required. Female unemployment has decreased by 3,900 to 58,000 over the years to the first quarter of 2017. That is line with a general reduction of those unemployed in the country. Nevertheless, more must be done to narrow the gap and to do so at a quicker rate. Therefore, the Bill is not being opposed by the Government and I welcome this fact. I have a number of slight issues with it and I will not go into detail on them because the Minister of State has already outlined his side of the argument in that sense. The need for change, as a result of the programme for a partnership Government, includes a commitment to promote wage transparency by introducing wage surveys for companies of 50 or more employees. Furthermore, the national strategy for women and girls, 2017 to 2020, which was launched in May this year, includes actions on the gender pay gap. So some work is being done and planned. The strategy notes the need for dialogue between union and employer stakeholders to address the gender pay gap. I noted the previous speaker's comments on this but I do not see how dialogue could hurt. The strategy also mentions the need to develop and promote practical information resources to explain and increase understanding of the multifaceted aspects of the gender pay gap and its causes. It also states calls for the development of practical tools to assist employers to calculate the gender pay gap within their organisations and to consider its aspects and causes, mindful of obligations regarding privacy and data protection. Further, it states the need to promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results. Therefore, there is some strategy in place at this stage in this regard. It has been argued by the Irish Municipal, Public and Civil Trade Union, IMPACT, that publishing information on the gender pay gap will incentivise employers to reduce the issue and to narrow the gap, as they will be in public competition with other businesses and organisations which pay their employees more equally. Furthermore, if such information is public knowledge, it will allow people to negotiate better pay in addition to allowing organisations and firms to engage with suppliers and businesses that practise equality with regard to gender pay. Therefore, the proposed Bill embodies meaningful change, such as publishing the figures of large companies, which I welcome. There are a number of small issues. The Bill is inconsistent with the method which is outlined in the national strategy for women and girls. I am sure that is something that could be worked through or ignored in the context of the Bill, perhaps. Consultation with employers and trade unions is needed, as I mentioned. The exercise of any authority or power to make a scheme would be at the sole discretion of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. There is no provision under which the Minister may request it to make a scheme. As such, there is no guarantee that the enactment of the legislation would result in the introduction of wage surveys, as envisaged under the programme for a partnership Government. I am not going to go through the other points that the Minister of State has addressed but I support the Bill. There are a number of complex reasons why there is a gender pay gap and therefore the solution will also need to be complex. We must address a number of factors and solutions to narrow the gap, such as providing affordable child care. We need to lead by example in these Houses. If any of us of child-rearing age were to be pregnant in the morning, we would not have the proper support with regard to hours and basic maternity leave, which is hard to believe in this day and age. The Government has implemented legislation to achieve and develop equality in Ireland, such as the introduction of paternity leave. I welcome that one of the candidates in our leadership race-----

There is clearly much work to be done in Ireland when it comes to the gender pay gap but one could not stand up as a woman and speak against closing this gap.

Sinn Féin is very happy to support the Bill this evening. I have to start with what is perhaps a negative on the commentary from the Minister of State. It is not so much on the detail, because in fairness, it is okay to express those concerns. The word that worried me is the same that worried my colleague, Senator Michael McDowell. It is this idea of consultation. There has been a trend in this Government to pass legislation to a certain stage and then park it.I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that the Bill moves swiftly through its various Stages. I do not think the women of Ireland will thank the Government for parking this Bill. For example, the consultation to which the Minister of State referred can easily be dealt with on Committee Stage. Sinn Féin welcomes the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is clear that the pay gap is, sadly, still a very relevant issue. I note recent information from the World Economic Forum predicted it would take until 2186 to close the current pay gap. Britain introduced gender pay gap reporting in April, alongside other jurisdictions across the EU and the US. These obligations will come into force in the Six Counties next month. While we welcome these moves, it remains to be seen whether they will have the effect of closing the pay gap. We are optimistic that they will. We have some suggestions for the Bill. We note there is provision for a class A fine for a company that does not comply with an eventual IHREC scheme. A class A fine of €5,000 will be a drop in the ocean for some companies. The Minister of State suggested reducing the fines. Sinn Féin would take the opposite view. Perhaps there is scope to increase them in some circumstances. Furthermore, we would like to see a more public element for companies that do not comply. The people who engage with these companies, namely, their customers and employees, should know this information. I will not labour the point about why we need to close the gender pay gap. Almost all of us know that it is necessary to create a more equal society. We know more equality benefits the economy. It will benefit many families in terms of increasing the take-home pay of women, with some projections in Britain estimating women's earnings could increase by £85 million. It is one aspect of a suite of measures that need to be taken in order to cancel out the motherhood penalty, which includes improving shared parental leave, child care that is affordable for parents and those carrying out the work and flexible work practices becoming the norm. However, the Bill, the practice of shared parental leave and so on are steps towards the idea of equality that will primarily benefit some sections of our society. In our view, they are less likely to assist those who are working in low-paid industries. We need a range of measures designed to counteract the real effects austerity and capitalism have on the working class, and on working class women in particular. We need to have a serious conversation about working class women and families who shoulder the burden of austerity, and how we want to assist them. Pay equity is a laudable goal but we must be careful that we do not inadvertently valourise motherhood only when it is combined with waged work of a certain standard without addressing the marginalising impact of structural issues that obstruct the realisation of real equality. Throughout the economic crisis and the imposition of austerity, there was a reduction of €30 billion in public expenditure in a six-year period, along with increased privatisation of public services in the context of a low-tax regime. User charges, so-called activation schemes and reductions in health, education, housing and community services brought severe consequences for women who were already in difficult positions. We welcome the Bill, while recognising the significant task of work ahead to improve the lot of those suffering the gendered impact of the last number of austerity budgets, where the individual incomes of women were reduced overall. We do not underestimate the importance of closing the gender pay gap but we need to address the Traveller, working class and migrant pay gaps and so on. Furthermore, the Bill will not address the teacher pay gap that, unfortunately, the Labour Party introduced which fundamentally undermines the principle of equal pay for equal work when it comes to newly qualified teachers, the majority of whom are women. It will not address class polarisation and the fact the recession was disproportionately borne by the more vulnerable. We must work to place the struggle against sexual discrimination in an anti-capitalist framework and recognise that we cannot separate the demand for equality from a critique of the role of capital and patriarchal structures in the struggles that women make daily to survive. In conclusion, we welcome and will support the Bill, while acknowledging the major social, economic and legal changes that are required to ensure true equality for all women. I wish to reiterate my appeal. We have so little legislation to deal with in the House. This is a worthy Bill. I ask the Minister of State to make sure that we do not park it. Let us move it forward and make progress for women in this country.

It is an important step forward and something that has been sought for a long time by groups such as trade unions, including SIPTU and IMPACT, the National Women's Council of Ireland, with which I have a record, the Union of Students in Ireland and many others. The necessity of the Bill is clear. Despite the legislation we have had for a very long time, our gender pay gap is persistent. It is worth noting that the gender pay gap has widened in Ireland. It was 12.6% in 2008 and widened during the period of austerity. It is not simply the case that we are not making adequate progress and may need to wait for 170 years for equality. Rather, during austerity and recession women were at the front line and the gender pay gap widened to 14.4%. It is now 13.9%, but there is a clear direction to travel. A Senator referred to phrases that are thrown around, such as "discredited figures" and so on. The gender pay gap is very clearly monitored across Europe. The fact that there are causes that lead to a result does not discredit the result. Such a comment is like saying that if we did maths in a fashion that stated that if one took away two and two one would no longer get four. Of course there are multidimensional causes and explanations behind the gender pay gap. That is the nature of how statistics work. We need to tease out the causes, take action and recognise that there is a societal responsibility.  In terms of the question of hours, the gender pay gap figures from Europe we are discussing, a gap which is 13.9 % in Ireland, refer to the median hourly rate. It does not take into account part-time work and other issues. In fact, if one adds to the fact that women are getting a lower hourly rate the fact that, in many cases, they are also working less hours one finds there is a wider gender pay gap. For example, the gender pay gap in terms of median monthly wages in 2014 was 22.8%. It is not the case that we have to consider part-time work and that will somehow make other facts disappear. If we consider the fact of part-time work, the gap gets wider. We heard about the higher levels of income for those with higher levels of qualifications. It is also important to consider the lower end of the income scale. The figures for those on low incomes are extraordinarily stark. Figures from the Central Statistics Office for 2014 show that 82% of women in the accommodation and food service sector earned less than €400 per week, as opposed to 66% of men. Some 63% of women in retail earned less than €400 per week, as opposed to 40% of men. In the area of health, 34% of women earned less than €400 per week, as opposed to 21% of men. There is a gap in wages across every single sector and society.  It is laudable that the CSO is examining the matter on a sectoral basis, but moving towards a solution requires us to take the obvious next step, move past a sectoral approach and examine the detail of companies. That is how we will address these kinds of sectoral gaps. I am sure IHREC may choose to prioritise those sectors where the gap is widest. This is where companies need to start being accountable. I recognise that the Government is allowing the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage, but I ask it to be enthusiastic about it. It is a tool which will allow us to identify where the gaps are. It is a very practical and nuanced tool. I do not believe it breaches privacy in any sense because it refers to the median across an organisation. I welcome that the Bill addresses the question of bonus pay. We do not want wages being equalised, but then have a culture where bonuses are only going to a select few on a regular basis.  Concerns were expressed about section 1(4)(f) in terms of potential identifiability, which could be addressed very easily.  I do not think it is something that should delay the Bill from coming back to us very soon. There is no guarantee as to when it would come back. I see these as extraordinarily mild amendments. We do not need consultation. The gender pay gap has been with us for an extraordinarily long time. Whether we want to tackle the gender pay gap is not really a matter that is up for question. It is not clear what consultation of great depth is needed, except on the actual detailed provisions of the legislation, which we can deal with through amendments. With regard to consultation between employers and others, I do not see why the Government needs to go back to the drawing board. We know there is inequality, and the Government has put it in the programme for Government. If it is serious about delivering on it, it will need to follow through and take action. Other issues have been addressed, such as our leave policies. If we introduce parental leave, which I believe we should, it should be in addition to maternity and paternity leave. There are questions of child care. There are also questions, which company information will tease out, on experiences of re-entry to the workplace, people's experiences of parking and whether people are given opportunities to progress after an absence of a year or two years from the workplace. There are also questions about flexible work as opposed to precarious work, and tackling precarious work which affects women most severely. Of course the knock-on effect of the gender pay gap is the gender pension gap. In Ireland this has risen from 35% to 37%. We have heard about the marriage bar as a great crime of the past. The marriage bar is still with us today. Older women in Ireland experience it every single week in their reduced pension and the averaging system which, it has been acknowledged, specifically discriminates against them. This is an area where the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has not yet stepped up to take action. I hope he does so in the next budget because it is an area of deep inequality, which is awaiting action. We know the actions that need to be taken and the only justification we have been given is a reluctance in terms of cost. Reluctance in terms of cost should never stand in the way of equality. I very much commend the Bill, which is very important. I would like to see it back in the House before the summer. We certainly need to see it early in the new session. We should see through. This is legislation is simple and effective and could deliver real results and send a real signal. I urge the Government, as others have, not to park it but to carry it forward. I suggest a further carrot, which could be considered. Companies which engage and comply could be considered more preferentially in terms of public procurement contracts. The State may wish to prefer to support those companies which have a positive equality record in the delivery of public contracts.

Senator McDowell mentioned that many Bills are coming forward but nothing is happening. This is constantly happening in the House. I have counted 141 Bills that have been passed Second Stage in the Seanad and the Dáil but have not progressed. To me this is unacceptable. If the Government does not agree with a Bill, for heaven's sake just oppose it on Second Stage and do not give false hope that legislation will be progressed. There is a possibility that one piece of legislation brought forward in Private Members' time will actually get through this session. Senator Conway said the Labour Party is a party of social justice and we certainly have a proud record on this, from opposing the eighth amendment, to the right to remarry, to the X case legislation, to same-sex marriage and to the gender recognition Bill. All these are achievements of the Labour Party. We fought those battles when they were not popular or profitable, and the fact I am in this House is recognition of this. There are surprising facts in this. I must hold up my hand in my ignorance. The fact we will face 170 years before we break the gender pay gap is not acceptable. What I have always said to my daughter, as she goes through education, is that through education she will achieve equality. In fact, the more females are educated, the more likely there will be a gender pay gap with their colleagues. This is what the data states. A man who does the same masters with the same results and makes the same contribution to the workforce as a woman will earn more than her. Unfortunately, this is true and it is what we have to address. Senator Mullen will have to forgive me because during his contribution all I could see was the image of him putting forward that a woman's place is in the home beside the sink. That is how it came across. It should be as much of a choice for men and women as to whether they want to stay at home and raise their families. There should not be an ingrained inequality with regard to salary for the same work with the same qualifications. Recently I submitted a series of freedom of information questions on bonuses in the semi-State sector. No bonuses are paid but there are performance-related increments. A woman working in the sector came back to me and said quite honestly that she never knew there were performance-related increments. How can people look for pay equality if they do not know that the worker next to them is paid more or that performance-related increments operate in the company? It hit me and, unfortunately, I say this against myself, that it is the old boys' club, or the men's club in the pub or on the golf course, giving a tip-off not to look for a bonus but to go for a performance-related increment. This can be isolating for female colleagues. This is why the key in the Bill is information. Through information comes power, which becomes a route to equality. We have to take every opportunity to challenge inequalities in society. I thank the Minister of State for his attention during the debate. I ask him to go to his colleagues in Government and to speak to the Labour Party about a pathway forward, so we can move this legislation forward and in some way tear down the wall of inequality between men and women in the workplace.

I thank all my colleagues who spoke in support of the Bill. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for expressing his support in principle for the Bill and his decision not to oppose it on Second Stage. Along with Senators McDowell, Gavan, Humphreys and others, I am disappointed the Minister of State was somewhat critical of the Bill. Of course, I am very happy to work constructively with him and his officials on moving forward. I accept there may well be amendments that might be necessary to deal with some of the technical issues. I note the concerns about data protection. Clearly, it is a huge priority and we must ensure data is anonymised and that no individual employees are identified. Transparency is a crucial issue. The Minister of State pointed out not only is the need to publish pay rates acknowledged in the programme for Government but it is also in the more recently published national strategy for women and girls. Action 1.23 is to promote wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results. We have very much drawn from existing commitments. We have drawn an existing legislation, in the shape of the human rights and equality commission legislation of 2014. In the UK, the Equality and Human Rights Commission is regarded as the appropriate body for enforcement of gender pay gap legislation. I do not think there is anything contentious or controversial about this. Of course, I am very happy to work with the Minister of State and his officials on bringing forward the Bill. I agree with consultation, but not prolonged consultation. I take Senator Gavsn's point on this. Contained consultation with stakeholders, of course, would be very welcome, but let us move the Bill forward. Senator Humphreys has pointed out just how many Bills have passed Second Stage and are languishing. I am delighted to say our Competition (Amendment) Bill 2016 to introduce collective bargaining rights for freelance workers passed Committee Stage in the Dáil this week. I understand it is likely to pass Report Stage in the Dáil next week. It will be the first Private Members' Bill from either House to pass all Stages and it was commenced in the Seanad. We have a good track record but this vitally important Bill does need to be expedited. There was widespread support for the Bill for which I thank all colleagues. Senator Mullen spoke against the Bill. His position was somewhat laughable. He seemed to regard the Bill as contentious and it is extraordinary to view it as an attack on parenting. I appreciate Senator McDowell's support for the Bill from within the same group. It is not contentious. This is a mechanism that has been adopted in other countries and has proven effective. I note that in the UK where a similar law has already been enacted, employment experts have said this could do more to reduce the earnings gulf between women and men than four decades of equal pay legislation. There is nothing contentious about the Bill. I accept that this Bill is not the panacea and there are other measures. Senator Noone and others spoke of the need for other measures to be brought forward, as did Senator Gallagher. There is a package of measures required to address pay disparity between women and men. If we look elsewhere we can see some really creative and innovative examples. For example, equal pay days - the first of which was introduced in Belgium in 2005, highlight awareness about pay disparity. In Switzerland companies are awarded an equal pay logo where they perform well on pay rate measurement scales. In Sweden there are large campaigns run around the logo "Everyday it's time for pay all day". They worked out that after 3.50 p.m. everyday women were working for free. In the same way one month in every year women in Ireland are working for free because of the gender pay gap. I thank all Senators for their support. I thank the colleagues who pointed out that this is a Bill in the proud history of the Labour Party in terms of social justice measures. Senator Humphreys outlined some of those measures. I see this as progressive legislation in the spirit of social justice and equality. It will create a meaningful change and would provide some effective way towards reducing the ongoing and persistent gender pay inequality which remains in Irish society, despite more than four decades of equal pay legislation. I commend the Bill to the House and thank all Senators for their support. I ask the Minister to convey to Deputy Stanton our desire to move this forward. We will bring it back and work with him and his officials on it to improve it and, if necessary, to engage in consultation. We are anxious to see it become law.
