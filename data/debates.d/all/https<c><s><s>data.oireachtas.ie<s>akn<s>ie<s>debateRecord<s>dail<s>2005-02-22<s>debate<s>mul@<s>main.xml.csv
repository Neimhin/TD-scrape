It is essential, therefore, that there be an effective partnership in place between Foras and the voluntary organisations in order that their common aims in relation to the Irish language can be achieved. That principle of partnership is specifically recognised in the business plan of Foras. In that context, I was disappointed that division arose between Foras and the voluntary organisations, which related primarily, as I understand, to a new system the Foras has introduced in relation to the funding of the organisations.The Deputies will understand that it is a question for Foras na Gaeilge to make decisions on the awarding of grants in accordance with the legislative framework within which it operates and in accordance with its corporate and business plans. I need hardly add that it is imperative that good governance should be applied by both Foras and the voluntary organisations in the expenditure of public moneys and proper accountability for that funding.I understand that there have been recent meetings between a representative group from the voluntary organisations, in addition to the voluntary groups themselves, with Foras to discuss these issues. There has also been a meeting between representatives of the organisations and officials of my Department to discuss this matter. I am advised that a consultative process is under way at present between Foras and the voluntary organisations with the aim of resolving this matter. Officials of my Department will be available, if appropriate, to assist the process in any way possible.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I thank the Minister for his reply. I purposely tabled this question in English because there are many people who are favourable towards the Irish language but whose standard of Irish is not sufficient to follow a debate such as this.I found it disturbing to recently read of a survey carried out by Foinse of 30 organisations dealing with the Irish language. There was unilateral condemnation of the way Foras is working. Matters raised included a lack of strategy and understanding, and too much secrecy. The organisations felt there was no proper dialogue between them and Foras.Lately, the Minister has made some moves in this regard but he should have been more on top of what was happening before matters developed to this stage. For 30 organisations to be so negative towards Foras in a survey is a bad development in terms of the Irish language. Will the Minister state exactly what he will do to ensure this situation is rectified quickly in regard to the promotion and development of the Irish language in the future?

The role of the Ministers — the two Ministers effectively act jointly in relation to Foras — is quite clear. What is also patently clear is that, subject to operating within the business plan and proper procedures, Foras is free to make its own day to day decisions and it would be inappropriate for the Minister to interfere unduly on two grounds. First, it is an independent body with its own board and, second, as I pointed out, it is a North-South body and, therefore, it takes two Ministers to make decisions on Foras. Every decision made in the context of An Foras Teanga, which comprises the Ulster-Scots Agency and Foras na Gaeilge, is made and signed off jointly by the two Ministers. I have called publicly on both Foras na Gaeilge and the organisations to work in a spirit of partnership. If appropriate my Department is willing to facilitate the process. However, it is out of the question that the Minister would give orders in this case as it would be beyond his powers.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I do not accept what the Minister has said. When an organisation is performing as badly as the organisations with which it deals have made clear in a recent survey, there is a need to intervene. For instance, it might be necessary to consider the board and its constitution. It is possible for the Minister to take action. It is unacceptable and would be very bad for the development of the Irish language if this problem were not addressed quickly.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It is a purely subjective value judgment as to how well or badly the Foras is operating. The Deputy is clearly basing his judgment on the survey of organisations carried out by Foinse. I must consider whether and how Foras operates within its business plan. As long as it operates within this plan and has followed good procedure, the Minister has no role in the matter. The Opposition’s approach to State agencies is a bit of a pick and mix. Sometimes the Opposition calls on us to stand back and have independent agencies. On other days when those independent agencies make decisions with which the public might not be too happy, politicians are called upon to interfere in matters that do not come within their ambit. I try to steer a proper middle road in these issues.I am clear as to my role and have fulfilled it totally. However, I need to be very careful, as a very bad precedent would be created if I overstepped my role. I understand that since the article was published discussions have taken place. I agree with the Deputy that it is very bad for the image of the Irish language to have warring factions arguing over issues such as this. I have urged both Foras na Gaeilge and the various organisations involved to sit down and thrash out whatever difficulties they have. In doing that I hope they will resolve the issues. Change in the system of funding is taking place and it is a normal human reaction to find change difficult.

Foras na Gaeilge has made accounts available for 2001, 2002 and 2003 to the Comptroller and Auditor General. A very complicated system of bringing the accounts together exists as two sections are involved. These accounts will be published as quickly as possible. Once one set has been completed, we will have the template for following with those for 2001, 2002 and 2003. I would like to clarify that——

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	17	On the prevalence of cocaine use in Ireland, I believe the Deputy is referring to the figures recently reported by the Council of Europe. The figures quoted in this report are based on the UN World Drugs Report, which was released last year. These statistics are not based on the NACD-DAIRU drug prevalence survey, which is generally regarded as the most reliable baseline data on drug prevalence in Ireland. I am confident that through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and through projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task force, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. All the local drugs task forces have an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities and they continue to have regular contact with the local communities in which they are based. The projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs, including cocaine.If cocaine use is seen as an emerging problem in local drugs task force communities, task forces can develop proposals and apply for funding under the emerging needs fund, which I announced last month. Task forces have been invited to submit applications to the national drugs strategy team for consideration by the end of March.I have visited a number of local drugs task force areas over the past year. I have discussed the nature of the drug problem in such areas, including the issue of cocaine, with community representatives and others. Arising from work conducted by the national drugs strategy team on this issue, I recently approved funding of almost €400,000 for a number of pilot cocaine projects, which are being rolled out in selected task force areas. The Deputy is aware that one of the pilot projects is in the Tallaght area. It is being developed by the Killinarden community addiction response project in conjunction with St. Dominic's and is targeted at intranasal cocaine users. I will examine the outcome of the projects closely over the coming months.The Deputy is aware that there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine. Existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. It should be noted that the health services have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years. On the prevention side, the national awareness campaign on drugs recently addressed the issue of cocaine as part of a well-received campaign. The campaign aims to tackle the perception that cocaine use is safe.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Garda and the Customs and Excise continue to target cocaine dealers and have significantly increased cocaine seizures in recent years. The mid-term review of the strategy, which is ongoing, will enable priorities for further action to be identified and the strategy to be refocused, if necessary, in the remaining period up to 2008. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in this context.I am sure the Deputy is aware that issues regarding supply reduction are primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand there was just one confirmed seizure of crack cocaine in 2004 amounting to 2 g. One person is before the courts at present in respect of this offence. I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply. We could discuss the extent of this country's drugs problem for a couple of minutes, but I am sure the Minister of State is aware that no towns or villages are untouched by drugs, particularly the new drug, cocaine. Communities are worried that the State will be slow to respond to the cocaine problem, as it was during the heroin epidemic of recent years.Has the Minister of State discussed the need for an awareness programme with IBEC and the trade union movement? There is evidence of a great deal of cocaine use in the construction industry. The lack of such an awareness campaign is part of the cocaine problem. Can the Minister of State make any proposals to assist the owners of pubs and clubs in which cocaine is sold? The sale of cocaine is widespread, particularly in working class areas but also in middle class areas. Can anything be done to prevent cisterns being used in clubs, for example? I am told that a type of paint that is being used——

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I would like to ask about the training of those involved in cocaine projects. For some reason, the Minister of State has asked the task force to identify such individuals. What were the reasons for that? Why were the projects not advertised? Will funding for emerging needs be used to help those already responding to cocaine use? Will we have to wait for up to six months until the projects mentioned by the Minister of State, including a project in my local area, have been evaluated? Will the evaluation be ongoing? How will it be worked out? How will it tie in with the work of the task force?I understand that various projects are under way, for example relating to those who inject cocaine, those involved in the sex trade and poly-drug users. How were the four projects decided on? I note that they are mainly based in the Dublin area. There is a problem with——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	21	We have used almost six minutes on this question.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I accept that cocaine use is a growing problem. That is why we introduced the four projects. I mentioned the one in the Deputy's area. All four projects are in Dublin and one of them concerns the training and upskilling of people in statutory employment and local drugs task forces to deal with what is a new and growing problem. Cocaine use does not show up much in overall national surveys, but I accept it is a significant issue. The pilot projects will continue to be such for six or nine months to determine whether they are good and valuable and whether they help people on the ground.We announced the emerging needs fund and other projects that the local drugs task forces want to put forward in this regard. They will have the opportunity to do so. A very good awareness campaign was engaged in lately. It targeted nightclubs and pubs and tried through the use of beer mats to get the message through to people.We are not being slow. Some complained we were moving too quickly. We are trying to move forward by way of partnership whereby all community groups involved will be with us. We have extra funding this year and have asked for suggestions regarding initiatives the groups want to implement locally. We are trying to act on this and I hope we can deal with the problem.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I understand Deputy McGinley is unavoidably absent and therefore we will proceed to Question No. 5 in the name of Deputy O'Shea.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I had proposed to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together anyway.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.Funding of anti-poverty networks arises from the White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and was originally administered by the Combat Poverty Agency on a three-year contract basis. This function transferred to the Department from that agency late in 2003. The Department sought work plans for 2004 from each of the ten anti-poverty networks funded under the White Paper and, pending review, agreed in the circumstances to extend funding for 2004 on a one-year contract basis.As I stated on the Adjournment debate on this issue last month, the Department was established by Government in June 2002 with a mandate to produce a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities throughout the country as they pursue their own development. In establishing the Department, it is clear that the Government was placing a focus on communities, particularly those that are vulnerable or under threat. In such cases, the provision of support to enable communities to identify and address problems in their own areas is seen as the best way forward. Those communities may be in rural or inner city settings, grappling with difficulties caused by a range of factors, including declining population, unemployment, language issues, social disadvantage or drug misuse. While most such communities or groups of communities can be defined in terms of geographic location, others will be defined on the basis of a common focus on a particular issue such as unemployment, disability or lone parenting.The Department's commitment in the context of the anti-poverty networks is to focus on concentrating available resources on support for communities experiencing disadvantage, exclusion and isolation. In line with this commitment, I decided to continue funding for nine anti-poverty networks in the amount of €1.35 million for 2005. This represents a 5% increase over the figure for 2004 for the networks concerned. However, as I indicated in my reply to Question No. 216 and related questions on this issue on 1 February 2005, in the context of focusing the Department's resources on disadvantaged communities, continued funding of the Community Workers Co-operative could not be justified.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.There is in existence a well-developed structure providing supports to the sector. For example, the Department will spend €2.3 million in 2005 on six regional support agencies in support of the community support projects. In addition, it funds 38 partnership companies to the tune of €45.7 million, 185 community development projects to the tune of €20.1 million and 32 community partnerships. Moreover, under the White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity, 66 networks and federations, including the national anti-poverty networks, are supported to the tune of €4.2 million.The Community Workers Co-operative differs from the other groups funded under the national anti-poverty networks in that they mainly deal with specific target groups. Other anti-poverty networks that will continue to receive funding have a specific focus on matters such as Travellers, unemployment, refugees and rural disadvantage. The Community Workers Co-operative is the voice of community workers rather than disadvantaged communities and its functions overlap with those of other networks. As such, it fails to meet a number of the key criteria suggested by the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity. These criteria include a membership base that ensures the voice of disadvantaged marginalised groups will find expression in relevant national fora, and individual networks should be genuinely representative and avoid unnecessary overlaps vis-à-vis each other.No other factors, as suggested by some Deputies, were involved in my decision. As I stated previously, funding of the Community Workers Co-operative to June 2005 in the amount of €358,413 under the PEACE programme for the Towards Achieving Social Change project is not affected by this decision.On the development of the community and voluntary sector, the details of my reply to Question No. 187 on 16 February 2005 confirm my commitment to and support for the community and voluntary sector generally. That reply gave details of €7 million in funding to the sector in addition to the range of indirect supports provided through area partnerships, LEADER companies, community partnerships, community support projects and local drugs task forces.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Minister of State's withdrawal of funding from the Community Workers Co-operative is regarded as vindictive in some quarters. The co-operative organises the community platform, which is made up 25 organisations that deal with poverty and equality issues. The organisation did not give its support to Sustaining Progress. Many people see a sinister side to this decision. The CWC is an independent voice that criticises Government policies if it feels they are not serving their intended purposes. Will the Minister of State assure me that this is not a vindictive action and an attempt to silence an organisation that is critical?The Minister of State referred to the ten networks, nine of which wrote to him asking that the funding be restored to the CWC. Every organisation dealing with poverty and exclusion has done likewise. This decision is inexplicable to most people in the sector and is deeply regretted. I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider his decision and listen to the people who value this organisation which recently held regional seminars on those issues at which money is directed. The decision does not make sense. I want an assurance that there is nothing sinister or vindictive in it.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I assure the Deputy there is nothing vindictive or sinister in this decision. It was taken because the Department decided to focus its resources chiefly on the communities suffering disadvantage and isolation. We do not take decisions lightly, for good or bad. The other nine networks deal with specific groups: refugees, the unemployed, lone parents, people living in rural isolation, Travellers etc. They are in a different category from the CWC.We want to aim the resources at the groups which reach communities and deal directly with people. The CWC is the voice of those working in the communities rather than the communities themselves. The decision was taken to give the resources to those most affected in the communities and for no other reason.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	28	For the Minister of State to say that the CWC is for workers is to misunderstand the nature of the organisation. It has 800 members. The Minister of State describes an organisation akin to a trade union. People in the sector are members of their respective trade unions but the CWC helps groups to co-ordinate or improve their focus.Is the Minister of State impressed by the level of support for the CWC? Is he prepared to state his reasons for withdrawing the money and to reconsider it with an open mind, as he has conceded that mistakes can be made?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The Deputy may be right that some people see the CWC as being akin to a trade union, and maybe it is doing good work as trade unions do——
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I said the opposite. I said that was the perception on the Minister of State's side.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	31	A great deal of correspondence has been received which makes more or less the same point the Deputy did. We did not, however, decide lightly on this and I am not likely to reconsider it. We examined this issue fully before making a decision. The decision was made to concentrate resources on those most in need.The other nine networks are very different from the CWC because each has a specific focus and deals with particular groups suffering disadvantage and isolation. The CWC has a different work plan. We could perhaps have made this decision a year ago when we took over the scheme because the White Paper stated that we should reassess and reconsider the issue after the three-year period. We did not have sufficient time to do so last year so we carried on the funding for one more year to give us time to examine the matter. Having closely examined the issue we have decided that the funds should be allocated to those most in need. Nine out of ten networks were funded but the one to which the Deputy referred has not.

I am considering this important and valuable report and I hope to be in a position to respond in the very near future. Discussions with the Minister for Finance will take place as and when they are required.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I would like the Minister of State's views on the issue of a vetting system for people who deal with children or vulnerable adults. Undoubtedly there is a difficulty nowadays in that people are somewhat reluctant to volunteer because of revelations in various areas that people abused clients. This is very important in terms of people having the confidence to become involved in the area.On the issue of in-service training for people involved in volunteering, is the Minister of State disposed towards making money available for this training? I gather from previous replies that he does not intend to introduce legislation to deal with this sector. As argued in the report, there is a real need to provide incentives for people to become involved in the sector.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Department is studying the report, which is interesting. Different aspects of the report, which includes some good suggestions, are being examined. Following the Tipping the Balance report, a sub-committee of the IAG considered how to move forward on volunteering. I will attend the committee fairly soon and I hope by then the Department will have examined the report. I do not want to give the impression that I will be able to act on all the recommendations in the report. However, I hope to be able to offer support in regard to some of the good suggestions made. Many training supports are already available to general groups in the community and voluntary sector, but perhaps more training can be provided. There is the general departmental training scheme and, under the FEDS and NETS, training was provided to a number of groups.Vetting is an important issue. Many matters might not come under the aegis of my Department because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are involved in the matter. The report is being examined and I hope to have some good news within the next few weeks.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Does the Minister of State find it embarrassing that four and a half years after the White Paper on voluntary activity and two and a half years after publication of the Tipping the Balance report he is responding to a report from an Oireachtas committee when his Department has not responded to the recommendations of the original report and the response by the community and voluntary sector?The fact that there was a reference to the White Paper in the Minister of State's previous reply indicates he is being selective in how it can and should be interpreted. I argue that one of the factors in determining whether the Department is successful in this regard is the number of volunteers in our society, whether they feel secure in offering themselves as volunteers and whether adequate resources are being provided. The Department is failing on each of those criterion. Rather than being an enabling Department, it has decided to be a distorting and controlling one. On those grounds, there is a case to answer.

Since the Department was set up we have been working with this sector to streamline services. Everything cannot be done overnight. In regard to proposals from the Oireachtas committee, we have been working on proposals for volunteering for some time. A sub-committee of the IAG has examined them from the point of view of a introducing a White Paper and from the point of view of the recommendations in Tipping the Balance. It is timely that the Oireachtas report has come forward, as we were working on these proposals. Within a couple of weeks, irrespective of whether it has taken four and a half years to get to this point, we will be bring forward measures from a structural point of view to assist in working with people who are trying to encourage and promote volunteering on a short-term and a long-term basis.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The committee's report contained other recommendations on where moneys in the dormant accounts fund should be targeted and on the use of the proceeds on the foot of actions taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau. I am referring to the proceeds from drug peddling and so on. It is recommended that those moneys should be redirected into the communities from which they came in the first place to combat social evils. There are many worthwhile suggestions in the report.It is estimated that the activities of volunteers save the State up to €485 million a year. Having regard to that, there is nothing particularly generous in the financing of in-service training. What is the Minister of State's view on how much, if any, of the proceeds of the Criminal Assets Bureau should be redirected into those areas that have been affected by drugs-related crime? Has he a view in this respect on the allocation of moneys in the dormant accounts fund?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I accept calling for CAB moneys to be put back into projects in communities that have been damaged by drugs is a frequent cry of people in the community. All CAB moneys were locked away, kept in suspension or whatever is the proper phrase for a seven-year period. This is the first year any of that money will be available for allocation to these projects or that it can be given to the Exchequer. It would be grand if it was redirected into projects in the community, but fundamentally it is important to ensure that proper resources are allocated to the drug task forces and into community programmes, and that has been happening. Funding to tackle the drugs problem is up 18% this year. If one were advised that one's source of funds would be CAB moneys, one would be concerned about relying on such funds, which may be good or bad from year to year. I do not much care from where the money comes once the money that is needed can be put into these communities.The dormant accounts legislation is going through and some volunteer groups applied for funding under the original tranche of funds. The Department will be examining that when the new legislation is in place and the new system is operating.

As a result of the multiplicity of applications, people who apply to many funds spend more time on administration than they would if things were streamlined in one Department.Is a national campaign to promote volunteering necessary at present? We did not cover insurance in the report but within the context of a national advertising campaign on volunteering, could a national insurance scheme be established so multiple groups could come together to apply for insurance and, therefore, get the best deal possible? Many people using facilities have their own insurance but the building owners are also asked for insurance so sometimes groups are hit with a double whammy when it comes to insurance cover.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	45	There are too many sources of funding for community groups, that is one reason why the Department was established. Some groups spend 95% of their time chasing funds from different agencies, programmes and headings but it all comes back to State funding. We would like to be the only funding agency for many of these community groups — it would make sense but trying to pull that together is a difficult job. It would allow people to spend their time on what they should really be doing rather than chasing funds and making submissions here, there and everywhere.We can help by promoting volunteering. The best way to do that, as suggested in the committee's report, is to bring this into schools and focus on it, particularly in transition year and on to third level. If young people become involved and are interested in and committed to volunteering at an early stage, that commitment will continue into later life. That is a recommendation in this and previous reports and I would like it implemented. I hope I will be able to do that when we have finalised our ideas.The Deputy has spoken to me about insurance and although that comes under the auspices of another Department, I understand where she is coming from. From my involvement in sport and community organisations, I understand this and will examine it to see if we can help groups on that point.

In conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, he could ask schools to become involved in volunteering. They could then direct teenagers to go and visit old people who have no one to visit them at home or in hospital. We are too relaxed about this. It is no wonder that volunteering is dwindling when this Government is not focused on a constructive, determined effort to look after the less well off in the community.Does the Minister of State agree that the money from the Criminal Assets Bureau should not go back into the central Exchequer but should be used in programmes in communities which are deprived and suffer from drug abuse and criminality? The money should be invested into those areas in addition to the existing budget. We know from year to year how much the Criminal Assets Bureau holds because it is held for seven years before——

Areas in 18 counties, amounting to a total population of 362,000, have been selected under the programme, including areas I announced in January 2003 in light of the 2002 population census data. This honoured the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to review the programme. Areas included were those that suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50%. The exception is the Cooley Peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. No areas of counties Carlow or Wicklow were included in the programme. There are no plans for any further review of the boundary of CLÁR areas and no other significant areas fulfil the population criteria for inclusion in CLÁR.CLÁR funds, or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments are made through a series of more than 20 measures which support physical, economic and social infrastructure such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village, housing and schools enhancement, health, broadband and sports and community projects. The measures reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the beginning of the programme.The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas. I intend to continue this practice for new measures I may introduce, depending on identified needs. Equally, I will keep the operation of existing measures under review.The merits of this practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme and vividly demonstrate that relatively small amounts of specifically targeted public funding can have a profound and positive impact in disadvantaged rural areas. Expenditure under the programme amounted to €14.14 million in 2002, €8.613 million in 2003 and €12.116 million in 2004, which it is estimated levered out a further €36 million in related public and private expenditure in those three years. The provisional Estimate for 2005 is €13.7 million, an increase of more than 13% on the 2004 outturn. I have recently decided on the allocation of the 2005 provision to existing measures and possible new measures. As a result, I expect that, once again, a comprehensive work programme will be completed in 2005.I recently announced €6 million co-funding with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for non-national roads projects in CLÁR areas. This funding will continue to improve the provision of local road access and the installation of flashing amber safety lights at schools. Local authorities may also replace, widen or strengthen bridges from their 2005 allocation.I am satisfied that this allocation will be sufficient to improve significantly local roads in CLÁR areas this year. CLÁR will also fund other categories of local roads this year, namely, local improvement scheme roads and forestry access roads. I expect that CLÁR investment in these roads in 2005 will be in the region of €3 million.

Is it the case that funding for local road schemes has not been increased for the past two years and has stood at €6 million a year? Does the Minister agree that, given rising costs and expenses, it is not good enough to say that this will be sufficient to do all the work needed in rural areas, particularly disadvantaged rural areas? Those of us who are canvassing in Kildare North and Meath may not necessarily be in the CLÁR areas, but we know the importance of safety at primary schools. More input is needed from the Minister's Department and the State in looking after the safety and well-being of young children using our primary schools, particularly in rural areas. Will the Minister agree there is a significant number of rural roads that need this funding and it is a shame and a disgrace that the funding has not been increased this year?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The Deputy is correct in saying the amount of money provided this year is the same as that provided last year. The budget is up 13% on the expenditure last year. There are choices to be made. In his question the Deputy highlighted the answer to his question. While there are problems with roads, there has been a huge improvement in rural roads in the past seven or eight years. The fundamental responsibility for roads rests with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities. In terms of CLÁR funding we set out to narrow the gap that we perceived existed between small roads in CLÁR areas and those in the rest of the country, to bring the roads in those areas on a par with the others.We are satisfied that under this measure significant progress will be made during the next three to four years, taking into account the work done in the past two years. If I increase the money for roads, there are other new programmes for which I cannot increase funding. I will certainly spend the whole €13.7 million and, therefore, it is a question of price. A "steady as she goes" policy is very effective. The particular mechanism identified ensures this money is additional in CLÁR areas and it has made a significant difference on the ground in respect of the worst of these small roads.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	55	When the Minister responded to similar questions in December he spoke about introducing new measures depending on demand and indicated that he is looking at new measures. What type of measures has he in mind? In a situation where there is an increase of only 13% in funding over last year, is it realistic to speak of the introduction of worthwhile new measures?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	56	It depends on all kinds of factors, carry-overs and so on. Last year we tried to ensure that the building was done on time and we paid for them all. I am confident that some new measures can be introduced. Some of the measures introduced previously have a certain shelf life, for example, the three phase electricity conversions for businesses. Obviously there was a big demand in the beginning but it appears from the number of applications now being received that most businesses that needed these conversions have converted. Therefore, the demand for that scheme is slowing down.There is a number of other small schemes that do not require the same amount of money this year as in previous years. It is a question of using the money to best effect. We are looking at a number of schemes. Given that discussions are taking place, I do not want to pre-empt those discussions. One of the golden rules of CLÁR is that nothing is agreed until the relevant State agency or Department has come on board and agreed the projects. In general, there are small issues of public infrastructure in typical low-population rural areas, relating to leisure and other kinds of infrastructure.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Will the Minister agree there is a need to be more open about how CLÁR funding is accessed and used? I cite the example of his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who made an announcement on child care last Friday. He stated that €1.1 million of the money was being allocated to RAPID and CLÁR areas. Unless one had a map one could not tell which was specific RAPID or CLÁR funding. Part of the problem in knowing whether the budget is being effectively spent or whether it is additional money is that we do not receive that information.A possible use for CLÁR funding, small as it is, should be to go beyond basic infrastructure and see how isolated rural communities can benefit. Perhaps the will suggest to his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that some of this money be used to update the information technology infrastructure given that many isolated communities cannot take advantage of a world that is moving apace in this area?

None of those troika projects is co-funded under CLÁR as that is not how that programme works. However, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform prioritises the RAPID areas. When the Deputy sees the list which will be published he will be aware that out of the total, it is significant.We have done quite an amount of work on broadband for which we had two schemes. A number of metropolitan networks were installed in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta. Last year we announced 12 wireless-based broadband projects for CLÁR areas. We discussed this matter with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources because, wearing my broader rural development hat, I am interested in ensuring rural areas are not left behind in regard to the whole question of rural broadband. We want to see whether the group broadband scheme is the best vehicle to deliver broadband to rural communities. Those discussions are taking place with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Obviously I will not fund projects where there is enough funding. I am also in consultation with the various partners, the regional development agencies, the Western Development Commission, Údarás na Gaeltachta and so on as they have a major role to play in regard to the provision of broadband in rural areas.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I refer to the idea of an extension of CLÁR and I am certainly not asking for a massive expansion of the existing area. I raised the matter with the Minister previously regarding a couple of specific areas in north County Monaghan surrounded by the Border, the Knockatallon and Bragan mountainous area. Clearly that area is eligible but is not a significant area in its own right in terms of qualifying. That it is cut off by the Border should be taken into account. The same situation prevails outside Castleblayney in the Mullyash mountain. That Bragan and Mullyash mountains can be clearly identified as being eligible shows the difficulty of those residing there. I beg the Minister to reconsider that issue in light of the peace situation — difficult as it is——

It was a good try on the part of the Deputy. I would love to include the whole of Connemara in the CLÁR programme but there was no extension in 2002 of Connemara because it was not warranted. The issue was looked at very carefully. I have here a map that shows the DEDs that are in CLÁR and, in blue, the DEDs in every county that are not in CLÁR that had a population decline of over 50%. There is only one DED in County Monaghan with a population decline of more than 50% that is not included in CLÁR, and it is not in the north but in the east of the county. That is according to the maps that were professionally prepared for us.Since the question was raised in regard to Wicklow and Carlow, according to the maps, it appears there are two DEDs in Carlow with a population decline of more than 50%, one on each side of the county. There are three in County Wicklow which are also separate from each other. The Department has tried to be as fair and objective as is humanly possible. Very clear ground rules were laid down and every area was examined in detail. It seems to me there is no other area that, on any fair and objective grounds, could by any stretch of the imagination be included in the CLÁR area and therefore the current CLÁR boundaries will remain. If the Deputy wishes, I will supply him with a copy of the map.

Seo an fhadhb. Tá an córas ar fad meáite anois ar chomórtas oscailte a bheith ann ionas gur féidir le gach duine iarratas a chur isteach chuige. Bíonn rialacha leagtha síos roimh ré, agus braitheann an toradh ar an bpróiseas. De réir mar a thuigim, sin é go díreach an rud a tharla. Lorg an foras iarratais le haghaidh tograí den chineál atá i gceist ag an Teachta ó phobail, agus fuair sé na hiarratais sin. Bhí critéir leagtha síos aige le na hiarratais a mheas, agus — taitníodh sé nó ná taitníodh sé le héinne — nuair a tháinig sé go deireadh an phróisis, níor thug sé an freagra áirithe a teastaíodh. Ba mhó a bheadh lucht na cáinte ag casaoid dá gcaithfí an córas próiseála a leasú mar nach raibh sé ag tabhairt freagra a bhí sásúil nó an freagra a theastaigh ó dhaoine.Ní fadhb le Foras na Gaeilge é sin ach leis an Státchóras ar fad, agus caithfimid bheith tuisceanach don fhoras sa méid is go gcaithfidh sé obair taobh istigh den Státchóras.

Tá sé ann ó 1893, agus tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh sé sáite go díreach i gceartlár obair na Gaeilge, agus níl an mhuinín ann anois. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go ndéanfaidh an tAire agus muid go léir ár ndícheall chun iad a chur ag caint le chéile arís.

Ní raibh na gearáin nó fadhbanna a bhí aici bainteach le ról an Aire. Glacaim leis go raibh an plé a bhí aici leis an bhforas féin. Mar a mhínigh mé ar ball beag, de bharr gur foras trasteorann é seo, tá beirt Airí i gceist sna bunchinntí. Chomh maith leis sin, tá córas an-chinnte dlí ag baint leis seo ar fad. Tá ról an-chinnte leagtha síos faoin dlí do na hAirí. Tá an bheirt Airí ceaptha i gcónaí feidhmiú le chéile. Tá sé sin teoranta. Déarfainn féin gur thuig Conradh na Gaeilge é sin.Is é an ról atá agam sa rud nááitiú ar chuile dhuine. Ní raibh a fhios agam roimh ré. Cuireadh scéal go hindíreach chugam cúpla lá roimh ré. Níor labhair an duine a bhí i gceist ag an Teachta liom go díreach faoi. Níor thóg sí aon cheist liom, glacaim leis, ar na cúiseanna a luaigh mé. Is é an t-aon rud is féidir liom a dhéanamh ná an dá thaobh a ghríosú suí síos le chéile chun an cás a phlé agus aon rud a dhéanamh chun é a oibriú amach.Caithfidhmid é seo a thuiscint. Tá méid áirithe pianta fáis i gceist anseo. Tá eagraíocht nua ar an talamh — Foras na Gaeilge. Tá athrú cur chuige agus struchtúrtha i gceist, agus aon uair a bhíonn rud mar seo ann le h-athruithe, bíonn fadhbanna ann. Is cuma cén chaoi a dtabharfadh an Foras faoi, bheadh pianta fáis ann mar bheadh buaiteoirí agus caillteoirí ann. Ní hé an rud go raibh an oiread taithí ag pobal na Gaeilge air sa mhéad is go raibh na heagraíochtaí céanna á maoiniú le fada an lá.Tá súil agam anois, ag éirí as an gcomhphlé, go mbeidh tuiscint níos fearr ag an dá thaobh ar a chéile agus nach n-éireoidh na fadhbanna seo arís.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 12, 19 to 21, inclusive, 24, 28, 31, 35, 37, 43, 45, 52, 53, 55, 57 and 264 to 266, inclusive, together.I have dealt with this issue comprehensively during Priority Questions and in previous questions on the matter in the House. The position is that in the context of concentrating the focus of my Department's resources on communities experiencing disadvantage and isolation, I did not believe continued funding of the Community Workers Co-operative could be justified. I prefer my Department's resources to be concentrated directly on communities suffering disadvantage.In this context, the Community Workers Co-operative falls short of the standards of the White Paper that each network should have a membership base which ensures the voice of disadvantaged marginalised groups will find expression in relevant national fora and that individual networks should be genuinely representative and avoid unnecessary overlaps vis-à-vis each other. Other anti-poverty networks which will continue to receive funding have a specific focus, for example, on Travellers, unemployment, refugees and rural disadvantage.It has been asserted that the Combat Poverty Agency's evaluation of the work of the Community Workers Co-operative was positive. However, the documents provided by the agency do not demonstrate that the Community Workers Co-operative is focused on communities experiencing disadvantage.With regard to the project involving the Community Workers Co-operative under the PEACE programme, I have no function in the details of the contract between the CWC and the implementing agency. ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency are jointly responsible for implementing the relevant measure of the PEACE programme. I understand, however, that discontinuing funding of CWC as an anti-poverty network does not, of itself, put the operation of this contract at risk.The CWC decision does not affect the funding for the Rialto Community Network, which will continue to be supported by my Department under the community development programme. The number and nature of the correspondence I have received on my decision suggests an orchestrated campaign rather than a spontaneous response.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	76	With regard to the PEACE programme, how will the contract be fully implemented given that the removal of its core funding would mean the Community Workers Co-operative will cease to operate beyond 31 March?The Minister of State offered general reasons for the removal of all funding from only one of ten national networks, the Community Workers Co-operative. He misunderstands what precisely the Community Workers Co-operative does. For instance, it provides material and news within the sector but more importantly — this is clear from the correspondence received by the Minister of State — it has helped groups within various sectors move forward in a more structured and organised manner and plays a vital role in evaluating national policy. It would be a major mistake to take the view that State-funded organisations should be gagged if they do not agree with some of the measures in which the State is involved.The Minister of State referred to an orchestrated campaign. While the national organisations may have communicated with one another, all of them have written to the Minister of State on this issue. They did not do so because they were asked to write to the Department stating that funding for the Community Workers Co-operative should continue or they believed they had nothing to lose. Rather, from what I can gauge, it is generally believed that the CWC has a distinctive role to play in the sector.The Minister of State referred to the positive report from the Combat Poverty Agency. As he is aware, the agency went much further than that by expressing genuine concern that the Community Workers Co-operative will be forced out of existence by the withdrawal of its core funding.The Minister of State misinterpreted my comment that the Community Workers Co-operative is regarded as a trade union in some quarters. The quarters to which I was referring are the Department and the Minister of State. Individuals in the sector belong to their own trade unions. It is incorrect to view the role of the Community Workers Co-operative as a trade union.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I am sorry if I misinterpreted the Deputy's remark regarding trade unions. The PEACE programme is operated directly by ADM Limited and the Combat Poverty Agency. If the Community Workers Co-operative has a difficulty continuing with the programme, I am sure the matter will be examined. The general opinion, however, is that problems should not arise regarding the programme.Contrary to what the Deputy indicated, my comments were not general. The Department assumed responsibility for the programme after its three-year timeframe had elapsed. It was the function of the Department to evaluate the programme in accordance with criteria specified in the White Paper. We obtained work plans last year and, having examined the work programmes, we decided whether the organisations concerned focused directly on groups suffering disadvantage and isolation.The Deputy stated that the Community Workers Co-operative does considerable good work, publishes news and materials and helps groups. While that may be the case, the Department's decision was taken on the basis of criteria laid down in the White Paper concerning what groups funded under the programme should be doing. Our decision was, therefore, based on the work programmes as presented to the Department.The Community Workers Co-operative is different from the other nine networks because the latter have a much more focused approach and operate much more in accordance with the criteria laid down in the White Paper and applied by the Department. The other networks focus on particular disadvantaged groups such as the unemployed, Travellers, refugees, those suffering isolation or rural poverty, lone parents, disabled people and older people. It was on this basis that the Department made the decision to spend the resources available to it on those working at the coalface with groups suffering disadvantage or isolation.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The answers given by the Minister of State are far from satisfactory. How will the saving of €150,000 he believes will accrue from this decision be allocated? Will a specific disadvantaged community receive €150,000? Will ten communities be allocated €15,000 each? Will 100 communities be allocated €1,500 each?Most of what the Minister of State said is not true and does not bear scrutiny. Of the other nine groups in the National Anti-Poverty Network, several are involved in general activities, including identifying poverty and providing resources to alleviate it. If the Minister of State is arguing that the Department's policy is to address niche poverty, the problems are more serious than we thought.It is not true that the Community Workers Co-operative operates as an organisation of community representatives. It is, like each of the other nine bodies in the anti-poverty network, a representative community organisation. If the Minister of State does not see that distinction, I despair of the reason for the Department's existence. It seems that a saving of €150,000 is to be made because the Government has decided that this body, which has been told it will not participate in the social partnership process because it has disagreed with the Government, should have its funding discontinued on the basis that it has identified how Government policies are operating negatively and to the disadvantage of the poor. The Minister of State does not realise that his Department's decision has created a sense of fear throughout the community and voluntary sector that those groups which receive Government funding are likely to have that funding removed if the Government disapproves of how they operate.It is obvious from the testimonials of the nine other organisations involved in the anti-poverty network that the Community Workers Co-operative does valuable work in terms of training, organising seminars, issuing publications and so on. All this work is dedicated to the identification and alleviation of needs in disadvantaged communities. It is unbelievable that the Minister of State contends that the €150,000 to be saved by his Department will somehow be put to better use for disadvantaged communities when the Combat Poverty Agency, the State body set up to advise the Government on how resources in this area can best be used, has said it will be counteractive to remove this funding.How will the PEACE II programme operate when funding is only made available for the additional work that is done through the programme itself? There will be no workers to deliver that programme because of the removal of core funding.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Minister of State should write down my questions. He tried this tactic earlier.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Deputy Boyle made a speech rather than asking questions.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Minister of State can read the questions I submitted.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I will try to respond to Deputy Boyle's questions. The saving of €150,000 is relatively small in the overall context of the budget of €300 million for such community programmes. However, this saving does not represent a cutback. The overall funding in this area will increase by 8% this year.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	85	To what purpose will the €150,000 be diverted?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The group in question is not the only one with which the Department works. Our function is to examine the situation in communities and to bring order and coherence to the various schemes that were funded by various Departments in the past. We have made some decisions that may be deemed harsh but they have been for the greater good. Last year, we agreed funding for 15 new community development programmes. This year's funding will be spent appropriately in working with communities to alleviate disadvantage. The other nine groups are much more focused and targeted in working with individual groups.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	87	That is not true.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	88	We see the Community Workers Co-operative as the voice of community workers. That is evident from the co-operative's work plan and programme.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	89	That is not true either and the Minister of State knows it.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The other nine organisations are much more targeted. This was one of the key elements of the White Paper, which provides that continued funding of the networks be reviewed at the end of the contract period, that the key criteria should include a membership base that ensures the voice of disadvantaged and marginalised groups will find expression in relevant national fora and that individual networks should be genuinely representative and avoid unnecessary overlaps vis-à-vis each other. The Community Workers Co-operative did not have its own focus or niche area and it overlapped with other groups.The Department gives significant support to communities in assisting their self-development. We fund 38 partnership companies, 185 community development projects, 32 community partnerships and six regional support agencies. Moreover, under the provisions of the White Paper, there are 70 networks and federations. Last year, we made some savings in regard to the regional support agencies by refocusing and reducing numbers. It is our role to constantly undertake such reviews and we will continue to do so. We cannot hope to improve the sector by adopting a policy based only on constant giving. We must evaluate and make decisions. In this context, it may be that some organisations which believed they were doing well will be obliged to alter their focus.This action is not being taken because the organisation in question has taken an independent line. As a consequence of my responsibilities in two Departments, I am aware that community and voluntary organisations are well able to stand up for themselves. The notion that the Government is being hard on a group or wishes to take it out because it can stand up for itself and give a contrary view is nonsense. Contrary views are given all the time and it is the purpose of such groups to provide input. There is no basis for the contention that the Department is venting its anger at one group.I will not comment on the involvement of the Combat Poverty Agency in this matter. The actions of that group are its own business and I will not cause a row with any other State agency. The Combat Poverty Agency originally operated the scheme and may be loyal to that procedure. However, it was decided the scheme should come under the aegis of my Department and the White Paper provides the guiding principles in that regard. We must evaluate and make decisions based on ongoing changes. We have made such a decision in regard to the programme, which was previously evaluated and received a positive recommendation. We are retaining nine of the anti-poverty networks and are providing increased funding. These groups have submitted good work programmes on which the Department can co-operate over the next two years.

Will I have an opportunity to respond on this issue?

The Government is about to commit a political raid on the €200 million contained in the dormant accounts fund for those most in need, the community and anti-poverty organisations. In the past, decisions were not made on behalf of those groups by the Minister of State or his Department but by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board. The Minister of State's political raid on that €200 million is disgraceful and shameful. He stands accused of the most awful political action in taking from community anti-poverty groups, which represent the most needy in society, the facility of an independent decision-making process in regard to the badly needed funding they receive. The Minister of State is taking for himself the decision-making capacity to distribute that money as he wishes and at his consent. The issue has been utterly politicised.I do not know much about the organisation of which the Minister of State has spoken. However, it is clearly a well organised group with nationwide experience of working in this area and it has been treated shamefully by the Government. The Minister of State has handled this matter in a disgraceful fashion and should resign.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I will allow Deputy Boyle a brief supplementary.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I understand the nine remaining anti-poverty networks are all based in Dublin. The organisation for which funding is to be discontinued is the only one of the original ten which is based outside Dublin, in the constituency of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. The Minister's silence on this subject is appalling.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Today, it was alleged to me that within days of the announcement of the withdrawal of funding from the Community Workers Co-operative funding was announced for organisations with no involvement in either anti-poverty or equality measures.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The dormant accounts fund is a different issue and legislation on it will be debated in the House either this evening or tomorrow. Approximately €60 million has been allocated by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	100	It was independently allocated. Now it will be decided by the Minister's political masters.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Funding is going to those groups most in need. Those groups will be targeted in the future, even with our introduction of changes to the board's structure and improved governance. Regarding Deputy Boyle's questions, it has nothing to do with where the groups' staff are located——
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	102	It has nothing to do with their views or their location. The Minister of State is not giving any answers.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It has nothing to do with that whatsoever. The Deputy is playing the "25 counties against one" game. Decisions are based on who the groups work with, not on geography. The target groups, be they unemployed, refugees, elderly, Travellers——
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Where is the decentralisation programme now?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	106	It has nothing to do with where the staff are working. Last year savings were made by the Department and, at the end of year, these were provided for some groups in one-off funding.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Is it true that these groups had no focus on equality or anti-poverty measures?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	108	We are satisfied that the work those organisations are involved in conforms to the purpose and programme of the Department. There is ongoing funding under the national anti-poverty networks. The spare funding was from other programmes from within the Department with no relationship to the programme. Funding came from end-of-year savings in the Department. At the end of each year, the Department receives submissions from organisations in the hope that there may be a one-off payment. Those groups that received it are working in the general field. The issues that they are addressing are in accordance with the work of the programme.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The same can be said of the CWC.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The funding came from one-off savings. This is annual funding which is a different programme. The CWC may get funding from other sources but not under this programme.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	111	As previously indicated to the House in replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 48 and 81 on 14 Nollaig 2004, a process of discussions has been initiated with the other EU member states and the EU institutions seeking official and working language status for the Irish language in the EU under EEC Regulation 1/1958. The regulation is the legal instrument that governs the EU institutions' official and working language regime.The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on 24 November 2004 that Ireland had tabled a formal proposal, by way of a draft amendment to EEC Regulation 1/1958, requesting that official and working language status be accorded to the Irish language. The focus in the discussions, which are ongoing, with representatives of other EU member states and the EU institutions is on securing agreement on the practical modalities for this objective. As indicated in previous replies, it is inappropriate for me to make any public comment on the detail of these discussions until they have been brought to a conclusion.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Minister's reply is identical to the reply given when this question was last raised. No Member on this side of the House wants to involve himself or herself in anything that could be detrimental to achieving official and working language status for the Irish language in the EU. However, one fears we will hear the same old song into the next general election. Have there been any developments since the announcement made on 24 November 2004 in furthering the achievement of status for the Irish language in the EU?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	113	It is all or nothing in this process. We must get agreement from all EU member states. When we are satisfied that this objective has been reached, we will then seek to have a decision made. As the work is ongoing, I cannot say any more. Last February people claimed the Government would never make a decision on seeking status for the Irish language and would keep putting it off. I recall these same arguments with the Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. In that case, we made the decision at the right time. The same applies to achieving recognition of the Irish language. Inniu sé an aimsir, but this is another one of those remarks made in the House about issues that will not be resolved before the next general election. I am confident that it will be resolved before the next election. I am also confident about the methodology used in achieving this objective.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I do not know where the Minister got the idea that people are claiming the objective will not be reached. We simply want to know what is happening. Is the Government being unsuccessful in a limited way? Are there major problems with some member states? Do some agree with the Irish position? Do some disagree, particularly those member states that have languages not considered a main language within their borders, but have larger numbers than Irish speakers speaking them as a first language? Members on this side of the House do not know what is happening, be it good, bad or indifferent. No one is commenting on whether it is desirable or otherwise. Will the Minister simply inform us, in as far as he can, as to what is happening? If all he has told us is all he can say, then he should not bother to reply.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Maybe I should not bother then as I cannot inform the House any more. The Deputy will be aware how these discussions take place. It would be inappropriate for me to discuss informal discussions that have taken place with other member states. The Government is committed to achieving this objective. Last spring, during the negotiations for the EU constitution, a similar process of working around the table in getting member states to agree was successfully handled by the Taoiseach. I am confident that those working in this process will have the same result. I will not go into details as to what is happening as it will not help the case because of how these discussions take place. It is wrong to believe that the Government is not committed to achieving this objective as quickly as possible. The day one decides to proceed with the argument for recognition, all 25 member states must be in agreement.

Article 8 of the Constitution provides that the Irish language, as the national language, is the first official language of the State. The English language is recognised as a second official language. Accordingly, these two languages are the only official languages constitutionally recognised by the State. Official languages are defined in the Official Languages Act 2003 in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. In these circumstances, the issue of amending the Official Languages Act 2003 does not arise.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I recently read that on a daily basis more people in Ireland now speak one of the Chinese languages than the Irish language. According to reports, approximately 50,000 Chinese live in Ireland who use Mandarin or Cantonese as their first language. Coimisiún na Gaeltachta found that of 90,000 Irish speakers, only approximately half of this number spoke Irish on a regular basis. What has gone wrong? Large resources were spent in developing the Irish language yet this comparison emerges. Ireland, whether we like it, is becoming a multicultural society where in the future languages such as the Chinese ones will be the first language to a greater number than those using the Irish language. I am talking about people who become citizens and whose rights are identical to any other citizen in the State. I flag it on two levels. It must make us reflect on how successful the movement for the revival of the Irish language has been over the history of the State and how much our society is changing and becoming more multicultural.

It talks about 90,000 people in the Gaeltacht. I think there are 86,000 people. It goes on to talk about the number of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht. As we all know, a large number of daily Irish speakers do not live in the Gaeltacht. The Irish language is the possession of the people of Ireland and not the people of the Gaeltacht. The Gaeltacht's relevance in all this is that it is the area in which the Irish language is still a community language.If one checks the statistics, there are more daily Irish speakers than daily Cantonese or Mandarin speakers. The only figures on which we can go are the census figures, which are authoritative. When one checks them for daily Irish speakers, and even allowing for the fact children say they speak Irish daily, one finds the article is another one of those in that particular newspaper which is short on fact and quite liberal in the way it interprets things, but good luck to it. I suppose it sells newspapers.The other issue is much broader. I know of no proposal to amend the Constitution to add other official languages. The Irish language was the indigenous language of the country going back 2,000 years and the one which survived. Norman French and English followed. English is now recognised as an official language in view of the fact a large number of people on this island speak it. I presume sometime in the future if there are sufficient numbers of speakers of other languages, the Oireachtas and the people — the only two groups which can do so — might seek to change the official languages of this State, but I do not believe it is an issue at present.

I agree with the Minister that more needs to be done and I fully support his views on preserving, improving and supporting the Irish language movement. It is also important that we interact with people who speak languages other than Irish and English, particularly at local government and local Health Service Executive levels. Does the Minister believe we should have a more proactive approach to employing interpreters locally and in our courts? We need to account for the thousands of new people moving to our country who speak languages other than Irish and English.

People coming to this country, particularly those with children going to school, tend to be very open to the idea of learning not only English but Irish as well. They often have a very open attitude towards languages. Many of them are not only bilingual but are multilingual when they arrive here.The influx of people into this country has changed attitudes towards languages which is very welcome and which, in a peculiar way — I have been asked the question recently by a number of commentators — is very supportive of Irish because it has resulted in a much greater acceptance of difference, multiculturalism and multilingualism which was not so evident 20 or 30 years ago when I was growing up. Every time I gave my name, I was asked what it was in English as if one could not have a name in a language without an English equivalent. There is a much greater acceptance now that one's name is one's name and that one does not have to keep translating it into another language.Written answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Many thousands of elderly people and their families are anxiously waiting for the Government's response to last week's Supreme Court decision which rejected its attempt to retrospectively deny people their legal rights. The net effect of the judgment, as the Tánaiste will be aware, is that tens of thousands of people were illegally charged over a prolonged period. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance promised this matter would be dealt with quickly and in a non-legalistic way.Will the Tánaiste confirm that rather than deal with this issue quickly, the Cabinet, by setting up a sub-committee, has effectively kicked to touch on it? Will she confirm that there will be a statutorily based scheme to repay those who were illegally charged? When will it be established? Will the estates of deceased persons be refunded? Arising from the setting up of the Cabinet sub-committee today and in view of the fact thousands of people are very anxious to know about this matter, how are people expected to proceed with the lodging of claims or will they be contacted by the structure arising from the sub-committee? What level of proof and documentation will be required? When is it likely to emerge? Where will the contact point be for persons who were victims or the next-of-kin of those who were involved in the issuing of probate for estate? When can they expect this matter to be dealt with in a non-legalistic way?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The Government is anxious to ensure the individuals affected and their families or their estates are repaid as quickly, efficiently and as fairly as possible. As the Deputy acknowledged in the number of questions he asked, this is a complex and mammoth task because we are talking about approximately 275,000 people. Clearly, the Statute of Limitations cannot apply to anybody who was not of sound mind, which would include many citizens in mental institutions, or perhaps intellectually disabled individuals. It is the intention to pay into the estates of individuals. However, considerable issues arise, including the administrative issue and the cost issue in that we are talking about a minimum of €500 million, although it may be substantially more than that.For all these reasons and given that we have never gone down this road before in terms of the scale of what is involved, the Government felt, after a long discussion on this matter today, that the relevant Ministers together with the Attorney General should meet quickly — we will meet tomorrow — to look at the issues, including the possibility of a statutory scheme being put in place. Above all else, we want to avoid individuals having to take legal action to receive compensation if we can.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. Arising from it, is she confirming that the Statute of Limitations will not apply to persons of sound mind going back beyond six years or to cases where persons were of sound mind but are now deceased, that is, to the estates of those persons? Can the Tánaiste confirm when she expects to bring the new Bill before the House in respect of the element of the judgment which was deemed to be constitutional, in other words the charges for the future? Most importantly in respect of a question Deputy Rabbitte asked last Thursday and which the Tánaiste answered, can she confirm that no diminution of existing health services will take place arising from the scale and scope of the charge against the State? If this is to be of the order of €2 billion, as has been rumoured, when will the Government bring a Supplementary Estimate before the House? Despite what the Minister for Finance has said, can the Tánaiste confirm that people involved in the health services and other services will not be short-changed this year arising from the Government's decision? When does the Tánaiste expect to have sight of the Travers report? Does she expect it to be published before the upcoming by-elections in view of the clarity of the Supreme Court's statement about that element of the judgment?

Clearly we will need to see the nature of what will be involved this year before we decide when to do that. Regarding the remarks of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, clearly the money that will need to be repaid is money that could be used for other matters. There will be no cutbacks in the Estimate for the health service this year or in other departmental Estimates as I confirmed in the House last Thursday.Mr. Travers interviewed me last Friday and indicated his report is imminent. I expect to have it by or before 1 March. I intend to publish it immediately after bringing it to Government.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Would the Tánaiste agree that in current circumstances it is desirable for the Government to speak with one voice? Can she explain the differences, which have emerged between Ministers and between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Taoiseach? Does she understand why the Taoiseach keeps saying that exclusion of the republican movement brought us 30 years of murder and mayhem when in fact precisely the opposite has happened? It is the 30 years of mayhem that brought us exclusion. Exclusion did not produce the violence. Against the background of the most extraordinary events in recent days, apparent international money laundering, the murder of Robert McCartney, the attempted purchase of a bank in Bulgaria and so many other matters, is it not important for this House to seek, in as far as we can, to best protect our democracy?In the matter of public money being made available for the practice of politics and execution of parliamentary duties, does the Tánaiste agree that we should consider changing the criteria necessary for a qualifying party, applied equally across the board to all of us in terms of public funds being made available and that the most basic prerequisite that we should require of all democratic parties, which want to access public money, ought to be fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State? If a party were not prepared to insert in its constitution a requirement that it subscribes to the institutions of the State that party would exclude itself as a qualifying party eligible for public money to carry on its political affairs.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	127	The matters that came to light last week are grave and very serious. They fundamentally alter many matters. In the first instance, I congratulate the Garda Síochána in defence of democracy. The Government speaks with one voice on these matters and it is important that it should. The reason for the breakdown in the talks process before Christmas was, as I said in the House, that some were not prepared to commit themselves to an end to criminality in all its forms. They were not prepared to sign on for a phrase that stated they would guarantee the personal freedom and liberty and all citizens. At many levels one would think that should be a simple matter to which to agree. However, for some it was far too much.It is not in the interests of or compatible with democracy that some have access to huge amounts of money — the proceeds of crime — to fund a political campaign. That is neither desirable nor fair. While this is the first time I have heard Deputy Rabbitte suggest a basis on which the taxpayer should fund political parties, I would assume the vast bulk of the people would only want their money to go to parties that subscribed to the basic fundamentals of democracy and all it entails.

I do not seek to entrap her into committing to any specific undertaking in this exchange. However, it seems that a very minimalist Bill could be brought before the House. My party has drafted such a Bill and the Tánaiste might be interested in making time available for its discussion. It would require the very basic preconditions for public funding and would exert them equally across the board in the House. In the light of recent events the taxpayers would be horrified to find their money being intermingled with money from such nefarious causes as we have seen for the purposes of funding any political party in the State or in this House. In those circumstances, I ask the Tánaiste if she would be prepared to examine basic legislation along the lines I have suggested that would not seek to exert punishment or penalty on anyone. Rather it would be a charter to which all of us in this House must subscribe if we want to avail of public resources for our parliamentary duties or political activity.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I assume that anyone elected to this House will abide by the Constitution, and will support and recognise the Garda Síochána and the Army. Other issues on funding exist. For example I would not like it to remain possible for some people to launder money overseas and take it back into this jurisdiction, perhaps as part of their fundraising activities. We need to examine many issues surrounding the funding of political parties, I hope, in an all-party context.

Will she note that I go further and state that if there are within this party people who are involved in criminal acts, then they should leave our ranks immediately? Will she note that I say that there is no room in Sinn Féin for other than a clear and unambiguous commitment to democratic politics and the pursuit of our goals by legal and peaceful means? Will the Tánaiste acknowledge that the members, elected representatives and supporters of this party are entitled to the same respect due to all citizens, to the presumption of innocence and not to be damned and demonised? Does the Tánaiste recognise that in a climate such as this, efforts are being made to spread guilt by innuendo, guilt by association and guilt because of the political views of people and not because of anything they have done? Will the Tánaiste note that while it would be easy at this time to devote all our energies to the war of words, remain on the defensive and be distracted from our purpose and pursuits, I have chosen instead to spell out clearly our responsibility to address any and every matter that requires our address? Will the Tánaiste and the House note that if republicans have issues to address, we will address them? If republicans are involved in any activity that besmirches the name of Irish republicanism in any way, they should cease such activity immediately. Any and all activity that falls outside the norms of legitimate political action should cease forthwith.Will the Tánaiste and the House accept that Sinn Féin is as determined as ever to take whatever hard decisions must be taken to move the peace process forward? Will the Tánaiste note our determination to continue to play the role we have played in helping to create this process, helping to bring about the cessations and helping to bring about the Good Friday Agreement and all that has flowed from it? We intend to pursue actively and achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, with all that entails.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I would like to acknowledge all of that, but I will certainly not engage in a convenient fiction for the purpose of responding to Deputy Ó Caoláin. The reality is that many members of Sinn Féin, perhaps all the Deputies from that party, do not believe it is a crime to murder a mother and did not believe it was a crime to murder Detective Garda Jerry McCabe or to attempt to murder Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan. That is a fact. For a party that does not recognise the Garda Síochána, it seems very keen to use Garda uniforms when it gets a chance to do so. Nobody is more eager than me to see Sinn Féin come fully into the democratic political system, but its members cannot have it every way. They have got away with it for too long and patience is running out. Quite honestly, some of us are getting sick of the antics of Deputy Ó Caoláin's party.

She did not listen to what another Deputy carefully said in the House. It is regrettable that the Taoiseach is not here.

Sinn Féin is determined to play a part in the collective effort to create the conditions in which the IRA will cease to exist. Will the Tánaiste accept that republicans have taken many difficult decisions during the peace process? Does she accept that the Sinn Féin leadership has moulded a political strategy that has brought the vast majority of republicans away from physical force? That process has not ended — Sinn Féin is determined that it will be brought to a successful conclusion by both Governments and all parties which are interested in that purpose and intent.I ask the Tánaiste to note that my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, has stated categorically that he has no knowledge of, and was in no way connected with, any of the activity for which four people were convicted yesterday. I ask her to note again that I have made it clear on the floor of the House that my fellow Sinn Féin Deputies and I reject the brutal murder of Robert McCartney. We have called on anyone who can assist the McCartney family to do so.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	191	No. 10 dealing with the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 is insufficient because it does not address the ongoing crisis in Askeaton regarding animal health problems. It should do so and if it does not, then we are not doing the job we are elected to do. Will the Tánaiste and the committee take this into account?I support Deputy Kenny in seeking a debate which I requested under Standing Order 31. It is important that the Government, contrary to what the Tánaiste said, clarifies its position because it is speaking out of two sides of its mouth.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I will make the same point again tomorrow in respect of time for a debate on Northern Ireland to receive clarification on this issue.In respect of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Amendment Bill, I note in newspaper reports that it is intended to wind up the Dunne inquiry into post-mortem policy. This has cost €20 million, has been running for four years and yet no interim report has been produced. The person running this inquiry is the only person running such an inquiry who is not a judge. Will the Tánaiste confirm that a finance officer was appointed to that inquiry to see that value for money was achieved? Were the necessary resources made available to that inquiry to produce an interim report? How was the person involved nominated and did the recommendation come from the Bar Council or the Department of Finance in terms of the money required?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The Government decided in spring 2000 to establish the Dunne inquiry which began work in March 2001. That will be four years ago next month. It has cost €20 million. We had hoped to have a report by the end of December but that did not happen. The Government has decided that 31 March is the final date for that inquiry in that form. In the event that there is no report by then, it will be a matter for somebody else to carry forward the work so far undertaken.On resources, €20 million is a considerable sum and I do not believe that was an issue. It was not a failure on the part of others to co-operate. I am not certain how the individual was selected. I am sure it was discussed between the line Minister at the time, the Attorney General and others. I am not familiar with how these things happened. I can confirm, however, that Anne Dunne is a senior counsel, not a member of the Judiciary.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	201	In the few days since the debate on Northern Ireland, the ground and the public temper have shifted.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The matter can be kept under review. I suggest that the Whips discuss it. There is an ongoing sensitive Garda investigation and there was a recent debate on Northern Ireland so it is a matter of establishing whether questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put in the normal way or some other format is the appropriate way to deal with the matters the Deputies wish to raise. That can be discussed in a different format.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Does the Tánaiste agree that the request being made is not just for a debate on Northern Ireland? We seek a clear Government position which I asked for under the request to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31. This was not allowed and, while I respect the Ceann Comhairle's decision, the Tánaiste should accede to the request for clarity from the Government. Her colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said two months ago there was no IRA activity in the Republic.

Most contributors were incensed by the content of the Bill which they were convinced confers no real rights on people with disabilities. They were also very annoyed — some speakers were outraged — at the Government's intention to push through the legislation without consulting the various groups or listening to their concerns and reservations about the Bill. I realise there was widespread consultation before the Bill was introduced but I understand the Minister has yet to meet a large number of groups who have requested meetings. He may confirm this. This question has already been asked by a number of speakers. I appeal to the Minister to meet with these groups as soon as possible. There are genuine concerns about the Bill which must be resolved before Committee Stage.Almost 90% of more than 30 organisations that made submissions to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights were highly critical of the Bill, particularly its narrow definition of "disability" and obvious resource constraints. While the Minister for Finance is in the House, I would like to say that while everyone welcomes that he committed multi-annual funding to the tune of €894 million up to 2009, it is not ring-fenced for people with disabilities. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this aspect. I listened to the Minister say on radio this morning that the health budget may have to be cut back if there are significant payouts to people in nursing homes and their families because of charges that must be repaid to them. Could any cutbacks in the health budget affect the €894 million funding for people with disabilities? I would like clarification on the matter as people are concerned about this aspect.Speakers expressed concern about a large number of issues with some of which I wish to deal. The disability legislation consultative group, DLCG, was established in 2001 following the withdrawal of the Disability Bill 2001. That group carried out extensive consultation with State agencies and so on across the disability spectrum and it is concerned about the provisions of this Bill. I take that group's views seriously. The DLCG believes that the definition of disability is too narrow. It is concerned that the definition excludes, as mentioned by a number of speakers, episodic conditions and early intervention needs.I point out to the official present that the definition of disability that everyone seems to want included in this Bill is the one recommended by the DLCG and used in the Equal Status Act and Employment Equality Act. I ask the Minister why that definition was not used. There are two definitions of disability, the definition included in the Bill and the definition included in the Equal Status Act and the Employment Equality Act. When it comes to deciding which definition to use, which one will get preference? There will be confusion surrounding the definition in the future. Who will differentiate between the two definitions? Why should we not insert in the Bill the definition recommended by the DLCG, which I am sure Deputy Stanton will propose on Committee Stage? I hope the Minister will accede to this request before Committee Stage.Assessment of needs is very much at the core of this Bill. Some people have referred to this Bill as an assessment Bill. It is important that it provide a clear right to an independent assessment of needs, but it does not do that. It must also provide for an individual's right to progressivity on unmet needs identified in an independent assessment report. This must be done annually or wherever there is a change of circumstances.The complaints system is far too complex and needs to be simplified and made more accessible. The appeals system needs to be independent of the Department of Health and Children and perhaps it should be the responsibility of another Department. The independence of the appeals system has been raised by a number of individuals and bodies. If it comes under the remit of the Department of Health and Children with officials from that Department reviewing appeals on which they would have made decisions, that would seem to present a conflict of interest and a contradiction. Responsibility for the system should be moved to another Department or the system should be entirely independent.I mentioned to the Minister for Finance before he left the House that the Bill must provide for a ring-fencing of disability specific resources. There was widespread welcome from Members on all sides of this House and from all the disability groups and organisations for the €894 million announced in the budget for this area, but if such funding is not ring-fenced, it could be spent elsewhere at any time over the next four to five years. If the Minister were to proceed with his threat to reduce health service funding, which I heard him mention on radio this morning, this multi-annual funding could be under threat. It is important to clarify that such funding will be ring-fenced, although there is no mention of such a provision in the Bill. Provision in this respect is quite open. It strikes me that disability groups and disability services will be provided for only when the money is available, that more or less everything else will be provided for first and then people with special needs and people with disabilities will be looked after. It is important to clarify the ring-fencing of resources for this area over the next four to five years.The Bill should also provide for a clear statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring and accountability. Where people are making decisions on the needs of people with disabilities, intrinsic to all decisions should be the view and voice of people with disabilities. It is important that those people who are affected in various ways are involved in the assessment process and the appeals process if it is to work. Unless one is affected in some way by a disability or working closely with people with disabilities and special needs, it is difficult to comprehend what those people go through and the various ways they are affected. Provision in that respect is also important.There has been much change in terms of provision in the disability area in the past ten years and certainly in the past 20 years. I accept many strides have been made, but any legislation enacted should be subject to review after a number of years, say three to five years.The issue of assessment is important. On reading through the presentations made by the various bodies, it is important that appropriately qualified people will carry out the assessments. Headway Ireland outlined in its presentation those who should carry out the assessments and it included a large number of disciplines. Currently, there is a scarcity of psychologists, sociologists, speech therapists and those in various other disciplines. An individual could be entitled to 20 services but may only get five of them. Where is the commitment to the provision of those other services? It is important that is addressed.The qualifications of the people who will carry out such assessments have not been clearly defined. In terms of the composition of a board that will be set up or the individuals who will carry out the assessments and the availability of staff, will resources be available to provide assessments in a reasonable period for the large number of people who will seek them? There is no guarantee that the necessary staff will be available. There is a major scarcity of speech and language therapists across the country, although 24 individuals are currently being trained. There is no speech and language therapist in the Nano Nagle school in Listowel where there are 90 pupils, and it is critical that such a service is provided. Who will make the assessments? If the service statement outlines 20 services, how will they be provided? If 15 services are not provided, what will happen?The Bill is defective in two key areas — the way in which it addresses the provision of specialist services for people with disabilities and the changes it proposes for public services to ensure people with disabilities are included as equal members of society. The Bill fails to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the high quality specialist support services they require to participate in and contribute to society. The Bill offers a flawed and bureaucratic system that offers little more than what is already available.The definition of "disability" in the Bill is too narrow and restrictive. It may exclude many people with disabilities who require supports and services, including many who are currently receiving services. There is widespread support for the use of the definition contained in other legislation such as the Equal Status Act.The Bill does not provide for an independent assessment of needs, services and complaints. Assessment officers are responsible for deciding what services a person needs and liaison officers are responsible for arranging the delivery of those services. As such, they have enormous powers but they will not be truly independent, as the Health Service Executive will employ them. The complaints and appeals system is so complex and bureaucratic that it will discourage people from using it. The complaints officers will also be employees of the Health Service Executive and thus cannot be deemed truly independent. Many people with disabilities and their families have enough to deal with without having to fill in endless forms and attend meetings.The Bill prevents people from going to the courts when they are being denied a service except in certain circumstances. In these circumstances, where access is allowed, it is limited to the right to go to the Circuit Court if the health or education authority fails to implement the findings of an appeal. Access to the High Court is limited to the right to challenge the outcome of an appeal solely on a point of law.The assessment, liaison and complaints officers should be independent of the Health Service Executive so they can put the needs of the person first rather than being influenced by their relationship with the executive that must deliver the service. There should be an independent and straightforward complaints system, including the Ombudsman's office or the Equality Authority, and people should have more reasonable access to the courts.The Bill does not provide for an individual to have unmet needs met on an ongoing basis. When a person receives his first service statement based on his assessment of needs, some services may not be available at that time. It is vital that if these unmet needs cannot be met immediately or in the short term that they are planned for and eventually met. These unmet needs must be reviewed and taken into account on a regular basis or there is a danger they will be forgotten. The Bill should progressively address the unmet needs of people with disabilities. The Bill should clearly state that unmet needs will be reviewed at least once a year and that the cumulative unmet needs will inform national planning for disability services.Most importantly, the Bill does not promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in all public policies and services or oblige statutory bodies to provide for them. It does not oblige all Departments or publicly funded bodies to ensure that all services provided are available on an equal basis to people with disabilities. There will be six draft sectoral plans by different Departments, plans which will be vague and that will not include important issues. The plan for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will not even address how it intends to respond to the housing needs of people with disabilities. It is vital if the Bill is to succeed that people with disabilities are at all times involved in the consultation and decision making process.The sectoral plans should be extended to include areas covered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. There are 30 million people in Europe with a disability, representing major potential for this country if it became tourist friendly for people with disabilities.Part 10, which details building requirements and access to public places gives a narrow interpretation and will not work. Currently, access is provided at the backs of buildings in areas that are difficult to get at. There are wheelchair ramps but they are unsatisfactory. I will return to this on Committee Stage.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Disability must be debated in an open forum like this. Fianna Fáil gave a commitment in 1997 to bring forward a disability Bill but it was later withdrawn. That, however, afforded an opportunity for people representing disability groups to come forward and discuss these issues on a broad, consultative basis, ensuring their views were heard.There is no doubt looking back that people with a disability were marginalised. They had no advocacy groups and often those with disabilities or those caring for them did not have the time or resources to express their views, to get involved in organisations or to highlight the concerns and needs of the people they represented. The disability Bill introduced in 1997 stimulated debate and brought about a consultative forum where people could highlight their concerns and needs in caring for people with disabilities and the challenges faced by those with disabilities.Deputy Deenihan is right, until recently most public buildings were inaccessible to people who were wheelchair dependent. It is a sad indictment of our society that we have to introduce legislation to ensure there is access to public buildings. It should be standard building practice to make provision for people with disabilities at main entrances and exits.That lack, however, indicates the era we were coming from, a time when government did not discuss disability because there was no effective lobby group to highlight the concerns of the people with disabilities. Every Deputy has chased health boards, tried to secure occupational therapist visits to houses for people with disabilities and gone to Departments to highlight constituents' needs. This Bill tries to address the concerns Deputies opposite and the Disability Federation of Ireland have raised. It is appropriate, therefore, that we acknowledge that we have come a long way in our approach to disability.All Deputies agree that more needs to be done. A major package of €890 million was announced in the budget to ensure funding would be in place to address the deficiencies in the health and education systems in addressing the concerns of people with a disability. As a result of the Supreme Court decision on 15 February the Exchequer faces a huge bill to repay moneys that were taken illegally from people in long-stay nursing care. I diverge slightly from the Disability Bill, but it is important to state that without resources any Bill passed in this House is merely aspirational. We should consider availing of the National Pension Reserve Fund on a once-off basis to pay the bill that resulted from the Supreme Court decision. If we are serious about addressing the concerns of people with disability and of people who may not have a disability but who need other forms of medical care, we should access the National Pension Reserve Fund to ensure that those who need services now will not be denied them. I am quite sure, given the buoyancy in the National Pension Reserve Fund and the efficient manner in which it is being managed, that we will make up the resulting shortfall before we begin accessing it for pension purposes in 2025.I understand there is €11.5 billion in the fund invested in various stocks and bonds and that the possibility of branching out into private property and public private partnerships is being considered. I believe the people who will be dependent on the fund in the future for their State pensions would agree to it being accessed at this juncture to ensure the provision of the myriad of services needed in specific areas, one of which is the disability sector. There were commitments in the budget. People speak about ring-fencing particular areas. However, by ring-fencing one area we deny other areas. For that reason I have tabled questions to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children regarding accessing the National Pension Reserve Fund and I look forward to receiving their answers. I am sure the parties opposite would support such a measure, given that the Exchequer potentially faces a bill of more than €2 billion if we do not invoke the statute of limitations regarding claims.On the Disability Bill, I understand solicitors are advertising to encourage people to go to a solicitor on foot of the Supreme Court decision on nursing homes. Businesses must try to encourage clients to use their services. However, it is disingenuous of solicitors to actively encourage people to use their services with a view to accessing moneys when the Government brings forward its proposals. They might have waited until the Government had addressed the issues raised by the Supreme Court decision and had brought forward a mechanism, which would be published and debated in the House. If there were deficiencies at that stage solicitors could advertise and encourage people to instruct a solicitor in order to access what was rightfully theirs. What they are doing is like objecting to a planning permission before the application is lodged.That situation would be mirrored in the potential of the Disability Bill if it were rights based. The Government is elected and it is in this Parliament that decisions must be made regarding the disbursal of revenue. No group is more entitled than the disability sector. Equally, nobody should head for the Four Courts to access their rights. That would result in diminishing the available resources and the State would be continually in the courts denying people their rights because those rights are resource based. The State would end up paying huge legal bills to solicitors and individuals. At the same time the rights of people who do not go to court would be diminished. Rights based legislation would deny the rights of people who, for various reasons, do not want to access the courts. There would not be a level playing pitch if the Government were to introduce the rights based legislation that some people in the disability area want. I understand their arguments because the issue is a very emotive one. It is traumatic for families and for people with disability. They want to know why they are not entitled to the services they need. Equally, there are many people involved, and in a rights based system the people who do not shout loudly will be left behind. Public policy should not be decided on the steps of the courts.Needs assessment is an area we need to examine. If a person is assessed and deemed to need certain services that are not immediately available, how often will that person be entitled to a needs assessment? Their medical or psychological condition might deteriorate while they are waiting for a service to come on stream. Will they be entitled to a further assessment? Clarity is needed in the legislation to ensure that if a person's needs are assessed and the services they need are not immediately available but later come on stream, their original assessment will be brought up to date. That is an area that must be addressed.Regarding the availability of resources, if we do not rapidly increase the numbers of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists and other specialists, we could end up with many people assessing people's needs and not enough people delivering services. If we do not increase the number of university places in those disciplines or advertise abroad for people with these skills, we will be continually assessing people and using up the resources needed for the provision of services.It frustrates people that funding is available to alter a house for a person with a disability but it takes ages to get an occupational therapist to sign off on the need for a downstairs toilet or wheelchair accessible shower. It should not be necessary for an occupational therapist to visit a home to assess what is required. We need to expedite that part of the process. It is issues like this that frustrate and infuriate people with a disability or family members trying to cater for a relative with a disability. I appeal to the Minister to come up with some way of addressing this blockage in the delivery of good, positive front line service that could make an immediate impact on a person's quality of life. County councils and city councils should have people who are engaged on this work full time and when an application is received they should inspect the house, see what is required and supply it. People have had to wait months and, on occasions, years for an occupational therapist. I do not blame occupational therapists. Obviously there is a shortage of occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists. There is a shortage of those at the front line who try to ensure that after an assessment the services are provided. If in law there is a right to assessment I fear that if the number of places is not increased dramatically and quickly we will end up assessing everybody and not providing any frontline services to those assessed.There is no doubt there have been many positive aspects in terms of mainstreaming in recent years. However, schools are finding it more difficult to cope in trying to provide mainstream education. I have met parents and teachers who are at their wit's end because they genuinely need more support to bring a child into mainstream education. This will have to be addressed in a forthright manner. If we are seriously committed to mainstream education resources will have to be increased. I recognise the budgetary package has been announced and that there is provision for the whole area of mainstream education. It is creating huge problems in schools which are trying to ensure a person with a disability is given the opportunity to be educated in mainstream education to enable him or her reach his or her full potential under Article 42 of the Constitution. We have a long way to go.Rather than provide a mediocre service in every school good quality services should be provided in one or two schools in a particular area which would be the driving force in providing mainstream education facilities to those with a disability. Rather than dilute the services across every school the services should be put in place in schools that are accessible to the bulk of the community and front-loaded with the major supports. There are cases where teachers in rural schools are not able to cope unless more resources are put in place. There may be only one or two children who are drawing on the resources but need full-time care. That issue needs to be examined. Transport must also be taken into account if we are serious about and committed to mainstream education.The equality legislation ensures that those with a disability are not debarred from the workforce. Given the percentage of those with a disability in the workplace this is a matter that needs to be addressed. It cannot be addressed solely through legislation — there must be a mind change among employers. There must be recognition that a person with a disability has much to offer. That a person has some form of a disability does not mean he or she cannot partake positively and productively in the workforce. We can have all the legislation in the world but until such time as there is a change in the mindset progress will not be made in this area.This debate on disability is a positive step because it brings the issue to the fore. For many years as Deputies and public representatives we highlighted the problems of individuals rather than seeking a strong, structured advocacy organisation to highlight the many concerns.It may be worth considering the establishment of a review group on a statutory basis to monitor the implementation of this legislation. It is fine to pass this legislation and hope the services will be in place. If the assessment area is not functioning properly and in the event of a breakdown in the perceived independence by people a review mechanism should be put in place on a statutory basis, independent of the Health Service Executive and the assessment structures. The review group should be from a wide section of the community with the necessary expertise and should assess whether the Disability Bill, with the resources available, has a proper impact on addressing services for those in the community with disabilities. In the area of assessment, there will obviously be challenges and, perhaps, the Health Service Executive and the independence of the assessors will be challenged in the courts. There should be a group of people who would analyse whether the intention of the Bill and the resources that will be provided in the disability package in the budget and elsewhere in the various health budgets are having a profound and positive effect on those with disabilities.This is a positive step. We have already withdrawn a Bill because of rights-based issues. I wish for a positive debate. However, there are a few issues that have to be thrashed out on Committee Stage. When it is passed I hope it will make a positive contribution and increase the quality of life for many with disabilities.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. As Deputy Kelleher said, I hope when it is passed it will be significantly amended from that before the House today.For generations, a set of physical or intellectual characteristics outside the dreaded norm denied countless Irish men and women, their basic civil and human rights. Those characteristics established more what they could not, rather than what they could do.Thankfully, today, society's discrimination against those who are "different" is lessening. That is thanks to equality legislation, the vast bulk of which is EU-derived, to the huge information and rights campaigns conducted by the disability lobbies and documents such as the 1996 report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality.The Disability Bill, long hailed as legislation that would definitively enshrine and guarantee basic rights such as access, has put paid to the hopes of thousands of people living with a disability and to the hopes of their carers. There should be no barriers to inclusion. The State has a moral duty to enable and to encourage, in every way possible, independent living for everyone with a disability. To make that a reality we have to create a system that asks people not what they have but what they need to make life better. We need to become a "can do", not a "could do" State for everyone with a disability and for their carers.According to the Combat Poverty Agency, seven out of ten people with a disability are unemployed. It is unacceptable in this day and age that the ESRI has found that 72% of households headed by a person with a disability live well below the poverty line. It beggars belief that a mother, caring for a child with a disability, is no longer entitled to the carer's allowance if she becomes a widow and receives the widow's pension. Surely, such an unthinking policy confounds common sense and compounds human tragedy.We need more personal assistance services, more aids and appliances, more residential and respite care, more day resource centres and services, more speech therapists, occupational therapists and recognition of the costs incurred by those with a disability in their day to day lives.This Bill has been long promised and we had a previous false start with the 2001 Bill which was withdrawn following overwhelming rejection by disability organisations and activists. In 1997, the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality, recommended the enactment of a disability Bill including the right to an assessment of needs, leading to a statement of needs and a plan which identifies how those needs will be met. After many false starts and promises, this Bill was published in its newest guise last September.There are a number of significant flaws in it. Disability is defined as an impairment resulting in a substantial restriction in the capacity of a person to carry out a profession, business or occupation or participate in social or cultural life. My colleague, Deputy Neville, has already examined this definition in great detail and the impact it will have on people with a mental illness. The area of disability as a whole must be considered. The Minister needs to sit down with the disability organisations to consider the definition of disability.Many people are of the view that the current definition is being used as a filter mechanism to reduce the number of people who will be eligible to qualify for an assessment. The definition is based on a medical rather than a social definition of disability. Genuine concerns have been expressed about the definition. For example, the definition excludes episodic conditions and early intervention needs for individuals and this could be viewed as a restricting mechanism. We need to consider an all-encompassing definition which facilitates all individuals in the State and ensures they have proper access to the type of services needed.It is critically important for this to happen at an early stage in a child's life. Far too often I have come across cases where a child has been neglected in the early stages of life. As a result more resources are required at a later stage to address that child's needs in secondary school compared to the investment that could have been made at an earlier stage with a resultant better outlook and quality of life for the child.The Bill provides for a system of assessment of a person's educational and health needs. This is to be carried out by an assessment officer working for the Health Service Executive who will have an independent statutory function. However it is to be carried out without regard to the cost or the capacity to provide any services identified in the assessment. It is turning into a wish list which is wholly dependent on the availability of resources. It is pointless to have an assessment to find out that an individual requires A, B, and C, when it is known for a fact that B and C will not be available within the resources currently provided for such services in the immediate future. There is no provision or commitment that those services will be provided over time. It is critically important that the Bill should provide for the individual's right to progressively meet the needs identified by the assessment report.Every Deputy in this House knows of children in their constituencies who have been assessed by an educational psychologist and for whom resource teaching support is recommended. The Department dragged its heels in processing those assessments. The initial backlog was in the waiting time for a psychological assessment. The partnership board in County Roscommon provided funding where families could not afford to pay for a psychological assessment. The backlog was then caused by the Department's delay in processing the applications. The reports have now been shelved and the Department of Education and Science has decided to give a lump sum to each school who can then disburse it as it considers fit. This is a return to the situation where the resources are not available even though the assessments have been carried out. My greatest fear about the provision in this Bill whereby assessments are carried out independently is that resources will not be made available.I ask the Minister of State to examine the issue of the domiciliary care allowance which is a cause of great frustration to parents. For example, every year or two, a family of a child with Down's syndrome is hauled in before a medical assessor to decide if the child is still entitled to a domiciliary care allowance. Bar a miracle, that child will still have Down's syndrome in 12 months time, two years time and in 20 years time. When the child is initially diagnosed with Down's syndrome, it should not be the case that he or she must be assessed on an ongoing basis. First, this is a demand on the limited resources available to the local health authorities. Second, it is a gross insult to the parents and many of them are extremely annoyed with the way in which they are being treated. They are hauled in for this medical assessment on a routine basis, either to determine if the child is cured or if the parents are abusing the child. This is what the parents believe is being assessed. I suggest that the Minister of State adopt a sensible approach and that the public health nurse should make a home or school visit to certify that the child is still in need of that domiciliary care allowance, rather than this medical assessment procedure which causes much frustration to parents in receipt of that allowance.I acknowledge there are instances where over time a child may not require the domiciliary care allowance but a child with Down's syndrome will have that condition for life. I do not understand the need for these medical assessments on a regular basis. Families regard it as a gross insult to be asked to appear before the medical assessor.The complaints system envisaged in the Bill is far too complex. It needs to be simplified and made accessible. Accessibility is a key issue of this legislation. I refer to accessibility to services and my colleague spoke about accessibility to buildings. The appeals procedure as provided for in the Bill is not accessible. I ask the Minister of State to significantly amend this provision and ensure that it is not a complaints system that is cumbersome, expensive and incapable of taking a person's needs into account. An appeals system should be freely available especially when section 19 is very similar to section 47 of the previous Disability Bill which stops people taking legal action. The State acknowledges that people have a need but in order to meet that need, they cannot take legal action. Section 19 only affords a person a right to appeal on a point of law and not on the issue of the decision. The appeals system should be independent. It should be freely available and accessible and not cumbersome as it currently seems to be.It is critically important that resources are ring-fenced and that this is provided for in the legislation along with a commitment for multi-annual funding. Far too often, people in the disability services area believe that when the squeeze comes — as was indicated by the Minister for Finance last night in respect of the health budget to pay for the elderly in nursing homes — those with disabilities will be the first to suffer because they are not the ones who will be able to shout the loudest. It is important that clear and concise mechanisms are provided to ring-fence resources.When funding is made available for a service it is important that this service follows the individual client who needs it. This would be the single biggest step forward. The legislation would ensure that the service would be client-centred rather than service-centred, which is currently the case.Turf wars are taking place among voluntary organisations across the country. Thankfully this is not the situation in County Roscommon where the Brothers of Charity Order is the one service provider but it happens in most of the neighbouring counties. A number of service providers seek to draw down funding from the Department. Unfortunately, their services are not subject to independent evaluation. While I was a member of my local health board, we did not have an opportunity to carry out any type of evaluation of services, although we saw the mess and turf wars. Every year the service providers made recommendations to the health board in which they presented a fait accompli.  They divvied up the money, leaving health board members with no role. It is critically important that we eliminate the ongoing turf wars among an array of agencies.If funding were to follow clients, the focus of services would shift towards individuals rather than services per se and people would be given commitments. I ask the Minister to shift the current focus from overall service to clients. This would be a major step forward.I will give one example of the type of a turf war I encountered. A number of children from County Roscommon received speech and language therapy services in a facility operated by the Midland Health Board in its catchment area. The therapist providing the service was paid by the Midland Health Board which received resources from the Western Health Board to provide the service because the children were from its catchment area. Due to budget restrictions, however, a decision was taken to exclude children from County Roscommon from speech therapy services. As a result, children were left without services for 12 months, during which the Western Health Board continued to pay the Midland Health Board for the service.This is only one example. I could provide numerous other examples of facilities lying idle because of disputes between different arms of the same voluntary agency or voluntary agencies competing with each other for clients to obtain capitation grants. This issue needs to be addressed. I ask the Minister to provide for client-focused services as opposed to allocating funding for services in their entirety.While it is critical that we legislate for genetic testing, in which I have a particular interest, the issue should not form part of the Bill. I urge the Minister to remove Part 4 and introduce separate, parallel legislation to address genetic testing. The Disability Bill is not the correct forum for addressing the matter. It is wrong to shove in at the end of the Bill provisions on an important issue that needs to be teased out more thoroughly.The Bill provides that a review of the legislation will commence on 1 January 2014. Ten years ago technology in the area of genetics was much less advanced than today. If someone had told us then how this technology would develop in the next ten years, we would have considered that person a raving lunatic. Technology has advanced in leaps and bounds and if it develops exponentially, this legislation will be obsolete by 2014. The Bill must be reviewed in five years at the latest, especially in light of rapid change in this technology. A broad debate is required on genetic testing and related issues such as cloning, on which we have no legislation. It is wrong in principle to deal with genetic testing at the end of a Disability Bill.Consent for genetic testing is provided for under section 40. What is the position as regards a child? Will a child or its parents give consent? I presume a guardian must gives consent, although this is not expressly stated in the legislation. What is the position regarding children in care? Will the Health Service Executive be required to give consent? I do not want a repeat of circumstances that arose in the 1970s, when children in care were treated as guinea pigs for vaccine trials by the health boards. The Health Service Executive will have responsibility to protect children in care, while having an interest in ensuring that clinical trials proceed. This is wrong and I ask the Minister to remove the section from the Bill.The position regarding the disabled person's grant is a mess. Its budget has been dramatically reduced and every local authority interprets the criteria differently. In County Roscommon, for example, an applicant may visit a general practitioner, rather than an occupational therapist. In addition, the level of resources available for grants is appalling. Unless a person is virtually bound to a wheelchair, he or she will not be entitled to a disabled person's grant in County Roscommon. Due to limited resources, many people with disabilities are being ignored.I am disappointed with the Bill. I ask the Minister to make significant amendments on Committee Stage to ensure we have legislation of which all Members can be proud.

The federation welcomed the Government's recent announcement of an €894 million multiannual funding package which, it stated, "will go some of the way in addressing the historic under-funding of services and supports for people with disabilities." I assured the federation that I would raise its genuine concerns about the Disability Bill during this debate.As a Government Deputy, I fully support the thrust of the legislation, for which the Government parties seek the support of the House. As a constituency Deputy, however, I must plead the concerns of my constituents and, as the only Deputy for County Westmeath, I have given my word to raise a series of concerns this evening.

Colleagues who were in the party for a time are now enjoying the pleasures of the Opposition benches. I fully respect everyone's view and the democratic rights of constituents who have proven loyal and faithful to Deputies.In its submission to me, the Disability Federation of Ireland described the recent announcement of funding as an "unprecedented and welcome development by Government." It added that while the new funding is important, it is only part of a difficult solution. It continued:We believe that, if people with disabilities are to become truly equal citizens in Ireland, this can only be achieved through legislation that ensures, promotes and enforces their status as equal citizens.In Ireland, people with disabilities have the same rights as everybody else. What we need is to be able to exercise those rights. If the Bill is adapted to provide for specialist services and secure the inclusion of people with disabilities in public policies and services it will vindicate in legislation these rights. People with disabilities will have become equal citizens in Irish society.Maria Fox, regional support officer of the Disability Federation of Ireland, asked me to raise ten points about which the organisation has serious concerns. The DFI argues that the definitions of disability are too narrow and that the Bill must provide a clear right to an independent assessment of need. It also contends that the Bill must provide for an individual's rights to "progressivity" on unmet needs, identified in the assessment report. This must be done annually or whenever there is a change of circumstance. The DFI believes the complaints system is too complex and must be simplified and made more accessible. Moreover, the appeals system must be independent of the Department of Health and Children and should perhaps come under the aegis of another Department.The DFI asserts that the Bill must provide for a clear ring-fencing of disability-specific resources. It must also provide for a clear statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include persons with disabilities in their plans and services and to establish appropriate monitoring and accountability mechanisms. Public services should include all those provided in the public system by statutory and non-statutory entities. The DFI contends the Bill does not take into account the wider context. For example, it claims the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not addressed some housing needs. The DFI further observes that clarity is needed on the impact of this Bill on section 14 of the Equal Status Act 2000. Its final point recommends a review of legislation after three years.These are the concerns expressed by the DFI, which I have given my word to read into the record of the House. However, as a Member of this House for 23 years and a member of the Midland Health Board for 18 years, I recall difficult times in the 1980s, as will other Members such as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Michael Higgins. In 1987, after the Midland Health Board had put through its estimates, I drove home from Tullamore to Castlepollard and wondered what dreadful event had occurred when I discovered more than 40 cars outside my home. These were staff who had been put on protective notice in the local hospitals.We have come a long way in providing for the needs of those who have never had an opportunity to grasp the benefits of the Celtic tiger. It is only with the return of the tiger that the difficult question of funding in this area has begun to be addressed under the aegis of a Minister for Finance who was formerly a Minister for Health and Children. It was a pleasure to be in the House on budget day to learn of the initiatives in regard to the funding for disability services.I do not wish to be political in my contention that the difficulties in my constituency are no greater than those in the constituencies of other Members. However, if we put our hands on our hearts, we must acknowledge that this Bill represents a decent start. There is a long way to go and many issues to be addressed in providing for those who find themselves in this unfortunate position. All Deputies want to see a decent and well-formulated approach in regard to the needs of those with disabilities.The provisions of this Bill have been carefully considered by the Government over the period since 1997. The Taoiseach has taken a personal interest in assisting the Minister for Health and Children during these deliberations. As much as possible should be done in the next several years, while decent funding is available from the Exchequer, to ensure that those in urgent need of assistance are given a reasonable quality of life. All Members agree that this is their entitlement. I hope the Bill has a safe passage through the House and that the Minister will find ways to accede to the concerns of professionals. The DFI is at the cutting edge and has daily experience of the ongoing problems in this area. The issues that organisation has identified should be addressed, either through this legislation or in the near future.

It is proper that Deputies on both sides of the House should welcome the commitment to expenditure on a multi-annual basis as announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day. The speeches made by Members of the Government parties have been thoughtful and committed, showing a great deal of care for the issues and cases that have arisen in different constituencies. I congratulate Deputy Cassidy on his wonderful achievement ag freastal ar an dhá thrá. It is one matter to be able to hear the concerns of the DFI in his constituency but another for him to change his sense of direction in regard to voting.The case Deputy Cassidy outlined is interesting. However, I wish to make several points which are fundamental and representative of real difference between us. What is missing from the legislation is the word "rights" itself, or the acceptance of rights from a theory of citizenship. This is not an academic argument but one that draws attention to the question of how one views the entire issue of disability. Should we, on the one hand, look at the person who has a serious impairment, whether of a physical or psychological nature, which stops him or her from participating in a particular activity, or should we look rather at the society which contains within itself a set of barriers that stop all citizens from participating equally?The first view suggests the necessity of a set of measures which propose a narrow definition for addressing what one feels to be particular difficulties in a manner in which one can afford to address them. The second perspective, which relates to the fundamental reform of society so as to take fully into account the rights of those with disabilities, requires that one must adopt a rights-based perspective. This does not require the immediate provision for everything that would be so recognised but it would require the Government to take upon itself the responsibility for a basic standard of provision and a set of principles which must be achieved progressively in order to meet the needs of every citizen.This is fundamental. We have been invited to reflect on the current situation whereby parents must justify their children's needs before a court. If one takes a rights-based perspective, no court would require the State to do what it cannot do but it would require the State to show that it was meeting the basic rights identified in the citizen's case. This is what the Department of Finance has set its face strongly against at every attempt to introduce disability legislation.It is interesting that while moves have been made at the level of the UN to introduce a convention that addresses the issue of disability, it will be opposed tooth and nail by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who uses the Constitution not as a means by which internationally asserted rights can be introduced into the lives of Irish citizens but rather as a conservative shield to block such rights as may arise through EU or UN conventions. He will argue that it is his business to say both citizens and any external assertion of rights will attune themselves to his conservative version of the Constitution's fundamental right. The Bill's fundamental flaw, therefore, is its deliberate eschewing of the responsibility of citizenship as would be carried in rights-based legislation. The Bill's drafters took upon themselves the issue of definition. A practical example of this is contained in section 2. It states:. . . "disability", in relation to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment;Representatives of the Irish Epilepsy Association have pointed out that an epileptic is one who is at risk from episodic impairment. Are they to be excluded from the legislation? This can be clarified on Committee Stage.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Using this as an illustration of this narrow construction, the term "enduring" will create immense difficulties for other forms of disability. If one had rights for having a disability, one would demonstrate it and it would be evaluated and accepted. The decisions as to whether it will be an enduring disability is an example of the difficulty associated with definitions based on premises that do not consider rights. When the Disability Legislation Consultative Group issued its report in February 2003, it entitled it Equal Citizens. It had spotted that if the problem lies with the society that places difficulties in the way of those who are disabled, then it is the society that should change, rather than it seeing the imperfections of the person, which is a defining purpose of this legislation.We debated this issue long before the Disability Bill 2001. It has been debated since 1993. The Commission on the Status of People with a Disability was established in November 1993, with Mr. Justice Flood as its chairperson. It produced 402 recommendations, the ninth of which called for a disabilities Act to be introduced to set out the rights of people with disabilities and provide a means of redress for those whose rights are denied. The report recommended that the Act should outlaw all discrimination against people with disabilities and should require public and private bodies, employers and educators, to make reasonable accommodation to meet their needs. The sheer thrust of this is to accept the citizenship basis of the rights that are involved. Having acknowledged a rights-based legislation, no one asked that provision be made for it overnight but that only the acceptance of the burden of responsibility of inclusiveness by the State.Regarding the debate so far, I am fascinated by the arguments for designing a society in which through access no impediments would exist for the disabled. Opposition Members have received correspondence from the Design Institute, pointing out that it was not consulted on the wider issue of designing buildings and an environment in which those with disabilities would not be impeded. It is not only about them being impaired or the removal of obstacles, it is about facilitating the fundamental principle of inclusiveness.There is an interesting example of what might happen with the legislation in future. Recently I listened to a report from the Minister for Finance claiming the costs of the debacle of taking moneys from vulnerable patients in nursing homes might have to be met by cuts in the education budget. This is waving a threatening stick, saying that if demands for rights-based legislation go too far, funding will be taken from others more needy. Immediately this exposes the absence of the acceptance of the principle of right-based legislation. The Minister of State is as familiar as I am with the extraordinary convolutions of people who assess and then handle the appeal process. Take the following scenario. After a liaison officer has prepared an assessment claim, one may wish to bring an appeal through the system proposed in the Bill. First, the liaison officer, or as many as the chief executive may decide, will offer his or her opinion on the case to the chief executive. The liaison officer, who enjoys his or her position at the whim and bid of the chief executive officer, is involved in an assessment that is neither free nor independent. It does not satisfy the basic principle of seeking another opinion. The necessary distance between the original opinion and the revised opinion does not exist. In any event, there is no question of changing the original assessment unless the circumstances of the individual involved are drastically altered. It is a representation of what we know already to be a less than satisfactory appeals process.I would be glad to be corrected, if I am wrong, about my argument concerning epilepsy, but I can think of other examples. The term "enduring" and the concept of permanent disability is a nonsense when referring to those who have suffered strokes or are recovering from them. All one knows is what one needs at the time. One cannot say if one is permanently disabled or otherwise. There is an issue of accessing evaluations. The appeals mechanism is flawed. Section 19 is reminiscent of section 47 of the previous Bill, and is a nod at abolishing what would have been the full function of a judicial review in the courts. In section 19, it was decided that an appeal could not be frustrated on a point of law. It states "an appeal to a court shall not lie against a determination of the appeals officer other than an appeal on a point of law to the High Court". The substantive matter, therefore, cannot be brought to court. One loses that right regarding the full statement in the court at the price of what is accepted in the Bill. It behoves us as legislators to look precisely at what is on offer in the Bill.I have sympathy for the Government on several points. I was a Cabinet member between 1993 and 1997. I shared a building with the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor. I know the difficulty one has in any Cabinet when introducing rights-based legislation. I also know of those with the permanent opinion within the Department of Finance who say over their dead bodies will they allow the principle of an open-ended system as suggested by rights-based legislation. Instead, they will only allow the introduction of what they consider to be an appropriate system that we can pretend is practicable. Draw the conclusion from where all that brings one — it is the defined availability of resources to the relevant Departments by the Department of Finance, which is defining the extent of the service available to those in need. The need is no longer associated radically with the person or reforms of the society; it is associated with what one can pay for.If one looks at the United Nations convention and what is going on in the draft convention there, it has taken an entirely different role. If one looks at the proceedings in the Commission and in the European Union, the European Union's definition of disability is a social one and it is quite wide. In the language it uses, it speaks of full participation and inclusion. The language in this Bill is at the other end of the spectrum; it is in terms of medical definition. We can argue on Committee Stage as to precisely how narrow that medical definition is and I am as open as anybody to be corrected on any part of it.It would always have been difficult in any Cabinet to carry through rights based legislation, but it would have been the right thing to do. It would have been the genuine road down which to go if one was talking about some kind of principle of equality in a constitutional sense. I know it is not for me but for others to decide whether this Bill is consistent with the Employment Equality and the Equal Status Acts if asked that constitutional question. Certainly, there are matters on which those who have been gifted by the Constitution with the right to require such opinion by the Supreme Court might well seek it. They would be wise to do so because, frankly, the definition of equality in the two Acts referred to is not the definition, as I detect it, in this Bill.There is also the incredible practical difficulty. Many Deputies who made good speeches, including those on the Government side, spoke about the nightmare experiences of those with disability in dealing with such fundamentals as basic housing provision. It is an absolute nightmare and it is coming down with forms that must be filled in. Some disabled people would almost wish themselves dead because of the amount of time it takes to come to terms with the dramatic change in a person's life when he or she can no longer climb a stairs. I will give an example with which I dealt recently. In a city development the plan required that one could not build an extension unless one left so much free space — that is, free space which the houses never had — so if one demolished the coal shed and half the kitchen, one would meet the requirement and the stairs was too narrow for a stair lift and so on. All of this convoluted nonsense is there and yet this is what we will see again as we make our way from liaison officers to assessment to appeals officers and so on. Not one of them will be able to change the fundamental decision and, under section 19, those involved have no recourse to the courts except on a point of law. No doubt we will come back to the definition of a point of law in section 19 on Committee Stage.What I was speaking about in relation to housing was the importance of mainstream housing. I am not imputing anything to Members on the Government side; I am simply saying there is a fundamental difference between us. I have welcomed what the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech, the real commitment he has given and the multi-annual structure but I cannot say this is rights based legislation. It is nothing of the kind. It falls short on all the fundamental principles I have mentioned, that is, in terms of definition, the right of independent appeal, the absence of commitment to progressivity, which might be made a matter for review, the whole nature of inclusiveness, mainstreaming through housing and in terms of what it leaves the citizen.I wish to dispose of one point a previous speaker mentioned, that there were many in the disability sector, across all the organisations, who accepted the principle that with all the rights based legislation, we would be giving the money to lawyers. That is a terrible suggestion. Quite frankly, there are some wonderful people working on rights based legislation here, in Europe and in the United Nations, including my colleague, Professor Gerard Quinn. I have heard it before. It is the failure of the State to treat every child equally that has required children's rights to be vindicated by the Supreme Court through their parents who have had to drag the needs of their children through the courts with the State, including different Governments, often resisting until the last minute. That was an abuse of the legal system.What those of us who have been advocating a rights based system have been arguing for is not to place an impossible burden on the State but simply for the State to take the responsibility to show why needs are not being met rather than for the parents of the person who is disabled or the child in need to vindicate their right. Something very good might come of this as more and more Deputies and Members of the Seanad debate this Bill. I hope the Government, before Committee Stage, comes to accept — it would be a very good day for these Houses — the theory of citizenship which generates rights for which we may not have the money this year or next year but within four or five years. That is what would define equality for us. That is the direction in which the Equal Status and the Employment Equality Acts were going and that in which the rights commissioners in Northern Ireland and here and the United Nations were going. It is also most implicit in the language of the European Union. That is the road we should choose.

This is the second attempt by the Government to introduce such a Bill. The first attempt failed miserably under a barrage of criticism from the disability groups. Unfortunately, it now appears that this second attempt will not provide the answers to the problems and is not the solution. The attempt to enact this legislation takes place against a history of neglect of the disability sector by successive Governments over the years. That neglect has led to a mistrust of governments by people with disability and for that reason, I fully support the campaign by the disability groups to put in place, once and for all, legislation which is foolproof and which, as far as possible, does not leave any loopholes through which this Government or future governments can evade their responsibilities. I hope the determined decision in the recent budget to put in place a €900 million multi-annual funding package will go some considerable distance to address the wrongs done to this sector of society over the years. This multi-annual funding is to be warmly welcomed and is certainly a very positive development.The great expectation for the Disability Bill 2004 was that it would be rights based. It was more than expectation because Government appeared to confirm that it would be rights based. However, it is now very disappointing to find that promise has not been delivered on. I find the Taoiseach's reason for not doing so implausible. He has basically said that it is not rights-based because we do not want to spend all our time in courtrooms. This does not stand up and it is a very disingenuous and regrettable remark as it infers that the only reason the disability groups want the legislation to be rights-based is so that they can go to court. In reality nobody wants to go to court and least of all the disabled and their representative groups. They find it hard enough to survive and progress without having to engage in courtroom battles with the establishment.It is very simple. The legislation should be rights-based because disabled people are entitled to their rights and this principle should be enshrined in legislation. In 2003 the disability legislation consultative group published a report entitled, Equal Citizens. This report contained many principles and recommendations. However, it is now a great disappointment that this Bill does not contain many of the principal features and recommendations of that report. This is very regrettable as the report contained the agreed vision of the disability sector on disability legislation.I will now outline a number of specific flaws in the Bill, which have been highlighted by the disability groups. The definition of "disability" is too narrow and is not consistent with other legislation. For example the definition of "disability" in the Equal Status Act 2000 is more inclusive. The disability groups contend, and I agree, that the current definition of "disability" would exclude many people with disabilities who require services. For example the Brainwave organisation has stated that people with epilepsy would not qualify as disabled and consequently would not be entitled to access to services to which they are at present entitled such as disability allowance and occupational therapy. While the Minister of State has rejected this view this evening, I await further clarification.The Bill does not provide the right for an independent assessment of needs and it does not address the individual's rights to have their unmet needs addressed over time. The proposed appeals system is too complicated. It is recognised that the appeals process would create a great deal of unnecessary bureaucracy resulting in resources being diverted from the provision of services on which they should be focused. The proposed system entails the system appealing to itself, which is unacceptable and must be changed. It is vital for the integrity of the legislation that the appeals system be independent of the Department of Health and Children.The Bill makes no provision requiring Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring. The Bill applies itself to the health and educational needs of people with disabilities. However, these people have other needs such as housing and employment needs. The provisions of the Bill need to be expanded to encompass those areas. While the disability legislation consultative group also proposed that the implementation of the legislation be reviewed after three years, regrettably this provision is not contained in the Bill. This omission needs to be addressed to allow for regular monitoring.While one can have all the legislation one likes if the resources are not provided to meet the needs, it is useless. The Bill should provide for the clear ring fencing of specific resources. The deficiencies I have outlined need to be addressed and rectified if we are to progress in the confidence that at long last people with disabilities will get their rightful dues.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Disability Bill. Obviously I welcome the multi-annual funding package recently announced by the Government, which will go some way towards addressing the historical under-funding of services and supports for people with disabilities. While the funding is important it only represents part of the solution. People with disabilities can only become truly equal citizens through legislation that ensures, promotes and enforces their status as equal citizens. In Ireland people with disabilities have the same rights as everybody else. We need people with disabilities to be able to exercise those rights.The disability legislation consultative group identified ten flaws in the Bill in two key areas, namely the access to specialist services and public services. While these flaws have been mentioned during the course of the debate, they bear repeating. Fundamentally the definition of "disability" in the Bill is too restrictive. Many people who require services will be excluded under the terms of the Bill. Some people who already receive services may also be excluded. People will have no right to an independent assessment, which is a major issue for disability groups. No provision has been made for people to have all their identified needs met over time. The complaints system is cumbersome, expensive and basically incapable of taking account of disabled persons' needs.Fundamentally the Bill is not rights-based. It protects the State's right to refuse services to disabled people by implementing in legislation clauses such as "where resources permit" or "where practicable". It does not contain a statutory duty to mainstreaming and does not extend to the private sector. It pays little or no attention to existing equality legislation and its enforcement mechanisms. The various sectoral plans are not underpinned in legislation. As many Deputies have already said, section 19 has a very similar if not identical effect as section 47 of the disability Bill that was withdrawn some time ago.In the area of specialist services, the Bill fails to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the high-quality specialist support services they require to participate in and contribute to society. The Bill currently offers only a flawed and bureaucratic system, which guarantees little more than what is already available. Disability groups and individuals have serious concern about the Bill not providing for an independent assessment of needs, services and complaints. In the Bill as proposed the assessment officers will be responsible for deciding what services a person needs and the liaison officers will be responsible for arranging the delivery of those services and as such will have enormous power. However, these officers will not be truly independent. The Health Service Executive will employ them. The complaints and appeals system is so complex and bureaucratic that it will only discourage people from using it. As the complaints officers will be employees of the Health Service Executive, they cannot be deemed to be truly independent. Many people with disabilities and their families have enough to do without having to fill in endless forms and attend various meetings.Section 19, which has already been mentioned, prevents people from going to the courts, except in specific circumstances. One will be able to appeal to the Circuit Court and one will be able to go to the High Court only on a point of law. Truly independent assessment officers, liaison officers and complaints officers are needed. They should not be employees of bodies like the HSE.The Bill does not guarantee the ring-fencing of funds for disability services and supports. It has been claimed that the Bill ensures that the Minister will have to set aside a pot of money to be used for disability services only. However, the Bill limits the amount of money that the Minister can spend on such services. Funding for disability services will be provided only after the Minister has provided funding to meet all other services.Disability groups and individuals have a particular difficulty with the Bill's provisions in respect of mainstreaming. The Bill does not promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in all public policies and services. It does not oblige Departments and publicly funded bodies to ensure that all services are made available on an equal basis to people with disabilities.The Government has produced draft sectoral plans for the various Departments. The plans, which are vague and general, do not address important issues. The plan for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, for example, does not outline how the Department plans to respond to the need to house people with disabilities. More importantly, the Bill fails to oblige such statutory bodies to ensure that people with disabilities are included in the development of their policies, plans, programmes and services.The disability bodies and individuals have serious concerns about the Bill before the House. They are disappointed that it is not rights-based legislation. It will need significant amendment if it is to meet the demands of such groups and the needs of people with disabilities.

The Bill is a key part of the National Disability Strategy being put in place by Government to underpin the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.The memorandum then lists a number of other elements of the strategy. I submit that the Bill will not achieve its objective of underpinning "the equal participation of people with disabilities in society" because it is quite clear that is deficient in many ways. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has presented the Bill. Given that three years passed since the Disability Bill 2001 had been introduced, I would like to know what the Department did for three years before it completed its preparation of this legislation.I do not doubt that people with disabilities were marginalised in society in the past. Such people were so busy with their own lives, for example, working to overcome the obstacles placed in their way, that they were not involved until recently in the lobbying process necessary to achieve their rights. That has changed in recent years, however. For example, people with disabilities succeeded in ensuring that the defective 2001 Bill was withdrawn, with the help of public lobbying and pressure and the work of Opposition parties in the Dáil. The Government withdrew that Bill in shame just before the last election, while promising that it would introduce a rights-based disability Bill. It broke that promise, which helped it to be re-elected at the last election.The then Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, promised representatives of disability groups that she would consult all such bodies fully before publishing a rights-based disability Bill after the 2002 general election. The Deputy has been sacrificed in the intervening three years — she has lost her position as Minister of State — because of her determination to introduce a rights-based disability Bill, as promised. Before the last election, she said she would consult the various groups about the promised rights-based legislation.Although the 2001 Bill was withdrawn almost three years ago, we continue to debate the inadequacies and shortcomings of the Government's proposed legislation in this area. Why did whoever was responsible for the production of this Bill — it may have been the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, or the Minister, Deputy McDowell — not consult fully the disability lobby groups and the bodies representative of people with disabilities and their carers? They have disappointed those with disabilities yet again.The following motion was passed at a meeting in the RDS on 8 February last:This meeting, representative of people with disabilities throughout Ireland, resolves that the Disability Bill 2004 is seriously inadequate and defective. As it stands, the Bill will do nothing to improve the lives of people with disabilities or their families; it will not meet the widespread demand for basic rights; and it will force people with disabilities into a bureaucratic nightmare in the search for essential services.This meeting further resolves that at a minimum, the Bill must be amended to include a clear, unequivocal right to an independent assessment of need for every person with a disability. That assessment must be translated in law into a statement of entitlement to services, together with an agreed plan to secure access to those services within a reasonable timeframe if the services are not immediately available. The Bill must also provide for a genuine appeals and complaints procedure that is independent in every way, so that persons with a disability have the right of redress in any situation where essential services are being unfairly denied to them. Finally, the Bill must provide for meaningful progress and targets in relation to issues of employment and access to buildings and services.This meeting finally resolves that we will continue to campaign vigorously, and lobby our public representatives, until this reasonable position is met.That motion, which was passed at a well-attended meeting, is fair enough. Deputy Cassidy mentioned earlier the faults with the Bill, as outlined to all Deputies by the various groups. I had great hopes until the Deputy clarified his remarks by saying that, despite his reiteration of the groups' opinions, he would support the Bill and the Government's amendments to it. It was quite a weak response, especially as the Deputy had given the impression that he was in favour of the rights being sought by the groups representing people with disabilities.The Bill does not provide for a clear right to an independent assessment of the needs of people with disabilities. It does not put in place an independent appeals and complaints procedure, or meaningful targets for access to buildings, services and employment. Does it help people with disabilities who wish to upgrade their skills to return to college or full-time education? Will such people be allowed to retain their invalidity pensions when they return to education? I do not think that is catered for in the Bill. Such a provision should be included in the Bill because it can be shattering for a person on disability allowance to be told he or she will lose his or her allowance if he or she returns to full-time education. We are saying to such people, in other words, that they will never work again, or they will not be in a position to take up work again, so there is no point in them trying to improve their educational qualifications. It is totally unacceptable. This issue should have been dealt with in the Bill.

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The motion before the House acknowledges in its opening lines that progress has been made in the area of special needs education, including the passage of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the Act was a positive step forward. The Minister acknowledged last October that the record of the State over decades in providing for children with special needs had been poor. She stated that, in many ways, the State was playing catch-up.We acknowledge that recent years have seen additional resources put in place. They are most welcome, if long overdue. That said, we do not hesitate to raise this important issue in the House again and to devote our Private Members' time thereto. The people concerned deserve all the attention and support the Oireachtas can devote to them. Since we last debated this issue in the Dáil, there has been growing frustration and concern among parents, teachers and principals at the plans for future provision for those with special needs.My fellow Sinn Féin Deputies and I have been in touch with many people and it is no exaggeration to say that anger and dismay are felt among broad sections of people in the education sector, especially among the hard-pressed parents and other carers of children with special needs. Old chestnuts that arise time and again when talking to parents include the lack of psychological services, speech therapists and occupational therapists and the inability to gain access thereto. The Minister must address these issues urgently.Let no one be under any doubt that the situation is extremely serious. The Irish Primary Principals Network, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the Irish Learning Support Association and many others have expressed grave concern at the proposed weighted system for the allocation of special needs teachers. The new system is due to be put in place for the start of the next school year in September 2005, which is only just over six months away. To plan properly, schools need to know as soon as possible what resources they will be allocated. Principals, in particular, bear a heavy responsibility under the Act and as time passes the pressure on them will undoubtedly increase. However, far worse is the pressure on children with special needs and their parents, many of whom face the actual loss of services under the system as proposed.In December last the INTO released the results of a survey of almost 300 of the most disadvantaged schools. It was carried out in October and November and replies were received from a total of 289 schools, representing 3,600 teachers. The results point to the major difficulties in the areas of special needs and in staffing, funding and attendance.The survey found that under the new system of allocating special needs teachers to schools proposed by the previous Minister for Education and Science, more than one third of the country's disadvantaged schools were set to lose teachers. The survey also found that 117 schools would lose teachers, compared to the 102 schools that would gain teachers. This vindicates the view of the learning support teachers who described this system as a quota system rather than a weighted system.The Irish Primary Principals Network has acknowledged the commitment of the Government to provide a comprehensive and satisfactory system of special needs education resource delivery. However, it states the following about the weighted system:Circular 09/04 refers to a ‘weighted system' of teacher allocation for SEN. This is actually a misnomer, as it is more of a Quota System using pupil teacher ratios as a blunt instrument that does not address the many nuances of disability. A true weighted system would address each individual child's educational needs giving a points rating appropriate to their learning disability or impairment. Each child would be individually rated in terms of their additional teaching and learning needs and the challenge they present in a mainstream classroom situation.Consequently the overall points rating of the school would reflect each individual child's educational needs and would ultimately determine the staffing level for the year. This system would be both fair and transparent.The Minister stated she would review the proposed new system and was committed to ensuring that no child would lose resources to which he or she is entitled. I welcome that commitment.One of the main reasons we tabled this motion was to give the Minister an opportunity to outline the results of the long-awaited review and to set out a revised and improved system for the deployment of special needs teachers. As I stated, doing this is becoming more urgent. Schools now need to plan in detail for September of this year.I hope the Minister will respond to other serious questions raised, especially regarding the range of special needs which will be addressed under a new system. There is concern that children who have been identified as having mild general learning difficulties will no longer be entitled to access resource teaching. Under the old system, each pupil in this category was entitled to two and half hours of one-to-one resource teaching per week. If the Minister is to fulfil her commitment that no child with special needs will lose out, this must be addressed.What of the position of children with severe specific learning difficulties, otherwise known as dyslexia, or children with Down's syndrome? In this regard, there is concern that the move to a new system will mean that many of these children will have to move back to special schools and out of mainstream education although the whole thrust of an enlightened policy is to ensure that these children are educated with their peers and with all the assistance they need. I hope the Minister has noted very carefully the view of the Irish Primary Principals Network that Circular 09/04 appears to be in conflict with the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act and the Equal Status Act. The individual's entitlement to an assessment of needs and an individual education plan is emphasised in the Act. As the Irish Primary Principals Network implies, the provision of resources on a quota basis whereby many schools' total resourcing will disimprove does not appear to be compatible with the thrust of the Act. The legal implications of this anomaly need to be addressed urgently.I want to cover some of the other key issues raised in the motion. I have mentioned the case of schools in disadvantaged areas. There are a number of such schools in my constituency. It would be scandalous for any school in a disadvantaged area to lose out under the new special needs allocation. I urge the Minister not to allow this to happen. However, disadvantaged schools have other pressing needs. One of the main issues is the high turnover of teachers and the relatively high number of inadequately trained teachers working in these schools.The INTO survey states that more than one in five pupils in disadvantaged schools misses more than 20 school days per year. This is substantially higher than the State average in primary schools, which is roughly 10%. In the most disadvantaged schools, nearly one third of all pupils misses more than 20 days per year.Another statistic speaks volumes about the education system and highlights what people often call the myth of free education. In disadvantaged schools only approximately 8% of income is from fundraising and voluntary contributions from parents, whereas in non-disadvantaged schools over 30% of income on average is from parents' contributions and fundraising. That is a massive gap. In addition to the fact that children in non-disadvantaged schools can avail of paid grinds, this is another real indication of inequality at the heart of our education system. Our primary schools should be places of equality in our communities. Instead, inadequate State support means that they reflect directly, in the classroom, the social and economic divisions outside the school gate.Our motion focuses on primary education but it is important also to point out that there is a huge shortfall in the provision of special needs education at second level. Applications for resources for second level schools have risen from 3000 in 2001 and 2002 to 12,500 in 2003 and 2004. This motion is about real people. It is about families and children who often struggle against the odds and about people with disabilities who demand their right to education. It is about parents whose lives revolve totally around their children and the struggle to allow them to reach their full potential. All they ask for are the proper supports and rights that the Government has promised them repeatedly. This is a constructive motion and I urge Deputies to support it. I look forward to the Government's response and the debate this evening and tomorrow night.

These rights include the right to education which is not adequately protected in the Constitution of 1937 or in Irish law. It is, however, a right enshrined in international instruments. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone, without discrimination, has an equal right to education. This right is also recognised in article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.The new draft international convention on the protection and promotion of the rights and dignities of persons with disability develops this further at draft article 17 which recognises "the right of all persons with disabilities to education". It states that the aim must be:c. the development of the child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential;d. take into account the best interests of the child, in particular by individualising education plans;2. In realising this right, States Parties shall ensure:a. that all persons with disabilities can choose inclusive and accessible education in their own community (including access to early childhood and pre-school education);b. the provision of required support, including the specialised training of teachers, school counsellors and psychologists, an accessible curriculum, an accessible teaching medium and technologies, alternative and augmentative communication modes, alternative learning strategies, accessible physical environment, or other reasonable accommodations to ensure the full participation of students with disabilities;c. that no child with disabilities is excluded from free and compulsory primary education on account of their disability.3. States Parties shall ensure that where the general education system does not adequately meet the needs of persons with disabilities special and alternative forms of learning should be made available. Any such special and alternative forms of learning should:a. reflect the same standards and objectives provided in the general education system;b. be provided in such a manner to allow children with disabilities to participate in the general education system to the maximum extent possible;c. allow a free and informed choice between general and special systems;in no way limit the duty of States Parties to continue to strive to meet the needs of students with disabilities in the general education system.This draft convention sets the standard. We welcome this and have called for it and hope that eventually Ireland will ratify it.Despite Government rhetoric, children with special needs do not receive the education which is theirs by right. Families find it difficult but necessary to seek redress through the courts for the State's failure to meet the educational needs and ensure the equal rights of their children.Deployment of teachers is not based on the right of individual pupils to have their special educational needs assessed, and the right of each pupil to the resources required to ensure that he or she can reach his or her full potential. When education is not provided on the basis of equal rights for everyone the vulnerable are left behind. That happens every day. For example, yesterday in my constituency, the mother of a four year old with special needs, who attends a school in Ballyfermot, contacted me. The child is sent home from school early each day because a special needs assistant is not available to him, despite the recommendations made at his needs assessment in September 2004. This is unfair, puts the child at a further disadvantage and is an act of neglect on the part of this State, in denying the child's right to education.The 1916 Proclamation commits republicans to ensure that all children of the nation are cherished equally. This is a core task for republicans and the source of our equality agenda. Sinn Féin believes in building a rights-based society, an Ireland of equals in which social and economic rights are fully protected in the context of human rights-based governance. This is why we recently recommended constitutional amendments, including a new article on the rights of the child and a stronger article on the right to education. I also commend the leadership and initiative of the former Minister for Education in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Martin McGuinness, who made education for people with special needs a priority under his tenure.I call on Deputies to put aside their politics of condemnation for one night because there is a significant consensus among us on the rights of children with special needs to education. I commend this motion, not because it concerns the rivalry of political parties but because it concerns children and our future. Let us move forward together.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	268	This motion concerns the unacceptable hardships people face in attempting to secure education for their children. It aims to ensure access to education for people with disabilities and special needs by applying pressure on the Government to provide this urgently.Sinn Féin acknowledges that progress has been made in special needs education, including the passage of the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. Like every other Deputy, however, I encounter numerous ongoing cases of parents fighting for access to education for their children. For example, the parents of a child in Ardee diagnosed with dyslexia, progressing from infants to first year, were told he must wait 18 months to be assessed by a psychologist. Imagine the effect of that on the child's education.Officials of the Department of Education and Science refused to grant co-operation hours for teachers of practical subjects in St. Brigid's school for children with mild general learning disabilities in Dundalk. This would involve an additional four hours and 45 minutes per day in the school. The result is that students with disabilities receive practical subject input on a week on, week off basis, which is not acceptable.It is also important to provide proper training for special needs teachers. There are instances in my constituency of ordinary teachers — perhaps they are extraordinary teachers — with no training or experience who are asked to cover resource hours. This needs to be addressed.The motion urges the Government to take immediate steps to fulfil its commitment to reduce class sizes for children under nine years of age to less than 20, and to plan for future teacher supply requirements, including the immediate establishment of a forum for teacher supply. This is particularly important for children with special needs. Last November, the INTO expressed its shock and disappointment at the announcement by the Minister for Education and Science that class size for all children under nine years of age will not be reduced below 20:1, a commitment made in the programme for Government.Class size is linked to special needs education. Reducing class size in the early years is a preventative rather than a remedial approach. A smaller class size gives pupils a better start and enables teachers to identify the particular needs of individual children. In the words of the INTO, "It is not that we cannot afford to reduce class size — we cannot afford not to reduce them".This State has the second largest class size in western Europe, with over 80% of children under nine years of age, 170,000 children, in classes of greater than 20. According to the INTO, to reduce average class sizes to under 20:1 will require approximately 2,500 more teachers. More will be needed to provide a smaller class size for children under nine years of age.Average class size here is 24.5 while the OECD average is only 22. Most states in the European Union have an average class size considerably lower than here, including Denmark at 19, Belgium at 20, Italy at 18 and Luxemburg at 15. Average class size at second level is 21 in the European Union while the OECD average is 24. The Government must place the issue of addressing class size at primary level at the top of its agenda. It needs to ensure that the commitment given in the programme for Government is met in full.Each Member could easily recall many representations regarding difficult individual cases in this critical area. We have chosen not to deal with individual cases tonight but to consider the broad issues. I hope the Minister will take on board the content of the debate, particularly the contributions of my colleagues.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Tugaim lán-tacaíocht don rún seo de chuid Shinn Féin i leith oideachais speisialta. I fully support the motion with particular emphasis on the need for the allocation of resources to meet the special needs and equal rights of all pupils, including the need to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools, the need to conclude the review of the proposed quota system for the allocation of special needs teachers and the right of each individual pupil to have his or her special educational needs assessed and the resources required to reach his or her full potential made available.I have always felt strongly that these are the initiatives that should have been taken at a time scarce resources were squandered on free fees for the affluent in third level institutions. This seemed more to do with attracting middle class votes than with achieving equality in education. I am not blaming the current Minister or Government for that. However, I hope the Minister will try to make rapid and radical progress on the reduction of class sizes, particularly in disadvantaged schools. I have spoken to many teachers in such schools, and those few who were lucky enough to have participated in the Breaking the Cycle programme were unanimous in the view that the scheme made a real difference to children's educational development, the only drawback being that the programme was only introduced on a pilot basis in a small number of schools. Even in these schools, it was only introduced in the junior cycle. If the principles of that scheme were put in place in all disadvantaged primary schools at junior and senior level, it would constitute the single most significant step in tackling inequality and disadvantage in the education system in this State.On the issue of the quota system for the allocation of special needs resource teachers, many of the very small primary schools in inner city areas are extremely concerned that under the proposed quota system they will lose out and larger schools in more affluent areas will benefit at their expense. I hope this is not permitted to happen. I tabled questions on this to the Minister in October-November 2004, including one which suggested that, under the proposed system, small inner city schools could each lose a special needs teacher while, at the same time, two national schools in Foxrock could between them gain up to seven teachers. That assessment was made by people involved in education and I had no reason to doubt them. I hope it does not happen. In her reply on that occasion, the Minister accepted that she was conscious of the difficulties that could arise, particularly for children in small and rural schools. She went on to say that the proposed model would be reviewed. However, we are still awaiting the outcome of the review. I support the call in the Sinn Féin motion that the report be published and an improved system of deployment of special needs teachers be initiated that will not disadvantage small inner city or rural schools.A number of parents of children with dyslexia raised with me one of the 60 recommendations of the task force on dyslexia which they believe has great validity, namely, that a database system be set up in view of the widespread need for such a service. I raised this matter in a number of Dáil questions with the Minister. For example, where children with learning disabilities are transferring from one school to another, arrangements should be put in place so the new school can link into a central database to inform itself fully of the child's needs arising from its disability. The reply I received from the Minister was far from encouraging. It stated that there is currently no central database available in the Department of children with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia, and that the responsibility rests with the school to apply to the Department for the necessary supports if these cannot be provided from within the school's existing capacity. This simply does not work. I hope the Minister will re-examine that particular recommendation of the task force and act on it.Many parents have put forward their experience that a great deal more needs to be done for children with basic dyslexia, but who have no other learning or behavioural difficulties. Many of these children simply do not have their needs identified early enough. When I raised this issue in yet another Dáil question, the reply I received from the Minister was that these children are catered for in the mainstream primary schools by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. The reality appears to be that in large and difficult classes, especially in disadvantaged schools, the needs of many of these children are not realised or responded to, despite the best efforts of teachers. Many more children with more difficult behavioural problems have far too long to wait for the necessary psychological assessment.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to this excellent motion on special needs education and the broader issue of all children with disabilities. While I welcome the debate, I believe we have had enough debate and it is now time to fucus on the needs of the children and provide services on the ground. I fully recognise that progress has been made in regard to some services, but that does not mean we should take our eye off the ball and ignore the reality of children in this State without services or adequate back-up.Last week, a young mother of a child with autism contacted me about her reality. There was no place for her child who wanted to commence school. First, she was told there was no place and when she visited a particular school she was told there was a long waiting list. She then contacted me and I made representations to the Department of Education and Science. I am also making representations to the Minister on the case. The Department is now working on the case to try to assist that young family. However, that is not the point. It is unacceptable that a young family with a child with a disability must walk the streets looking for a place for their child, or contact a Deputy to get a place. It is a disgrace and shame in 2005. It is also blatant discrimination. It is a reminder to the Government that rights-based legislation in regard to disabilities is the way forward. It is no longer acceptable in a wealthy country to have children with disabilities on waiting lists. This scandal and crime must end now.I support strongly sections 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the motion, which offer a solution to the issue. I urge the Government to ensure there is further progress in delivery of promised improvements, including allocation of the resources required to meet the special needs and equal rights of all pupils and to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools. I also raise the widespread concern among parents, teachers and principals that the proposed weighted system of allocation of special needs teachers to schools would, in practice, be a quota system which would result in the loss of teachers to many schools, particularly in disadvantaged and rural areas, and the loss of support to many pupils with special needs.I acknowledge the statement from the Minister that she wishes to see a system introduced that would not result in the loss of services to any child. I commend her for that statement earlier. I now call on her to conclude immediately her Department's review of the proposed weighted system, to publish the outcome of the review and to initiate a revised and improved system for deployment of special needs teachers as soon as possible. I urge that such a deployment of teachers be based on the rights of each individual pupil to have his or her special educational needs assessed and on the right of each pupil to the resources required to ensure that each can reach his or her full potential. These are all sensible proposals in the motion and I call on all Deputies in the House to support the pupils, teachers and parents.On the issue of the courts in section 2 of the motion, as a parent of a child with a disability, I find it insulting and degrading when I see other parents forced to go to the courts to get a service. This should not be happening, especially with the passage of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2004. Parents of children with disabilities have enough on their plate besides having to go to court and all the hassle that entails. The simple solution is that all children with special needs get a service as a right. For those who have not woken up, this is all part of the equality agenda and we need to quickly get on with it. We need the Minister to quickly move to recruit the additional 650 teachers needed to implement the programme of improved education for persons with special needs.There seems to be much confusion, bureaucracy and delays in assisting children with special needs. These genuine complaints must be dealt with head on because the children are losing out. One school I know of was granted 1.6 resource teachers but this allocation is being delayed by the Department. Children are losing out and these delays in the provision of a service are not good enough. People are forced to jump through major hoops and obstacles and the fact that the IQ must be below 55 excludes thousands of pupils. There is no automatic entitlements for some children with special needs. I am concerned about provision for children with dyslexia. I urge the Minister to act on these complaints. Teachers are being dragged all over the place, meeting various agencies and dealing with bureaucracy when they need to be in the classroom with the pupils. I urge the Minister to listen to parents, the views of teachers and those in the schools trying to provide the service.I thank and pay tribute to the many teachers working in this field. They deserve our support and deserve action from the Department of Education and Science. We have had enough talk. We should get back to basics and let teachers get on with teaching.I wish to raise the major crisis of the lack of speech therapists and occupational therapists. This shortage of such personnel must be dealt with. I urge Members to support this motion. It is about children, assisting teachers, education, providing a quality educational service for all our pupils and, above all, giving our children a chance to go forward in the future. I urge all Members to support this motion.

Admittedly, the Government has made some progress but it has also been found wanting in a number of areas.During my relatively short contribution I would like to examine a number of aspects of education for persons with special needs as they relate to this debate. Before going into detail, it is worth pointing out the Green Party's broad support for this motion. We support the thrust of the motion and call for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Report on Educational Provision and Support for Persons with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. It goes without saying that we believe that existing schools which cater for pupils with special needs are under-resourced and this is another area that needs prioritisation. In addition, we share the concerns regarding the development of the Middletown Centre for Autism.The time available does not allow for an in-depth analysis of all these areas but there are a number of key issues in other areas that I would like to address. They include concerns over the weighted system of allocation of special needs teachers to schools; the need for the Government to fulfil its commitment to reduce class sizes for children at primary school level, particularly those under the age of nine; and the fact that many families still consider it necessary to take legal action to ensure their children receive an adequate education.Like other speakers, I recognise the work that has gone into the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. It is certainly a major progression. The Minister's predecessor and the collective Cabinet worked hard to ensure that the Act was far-reaching, but however far-reaching it appeared, it was not far-reaching enough.The issue of education as a basic fundamental right for all our citizens remains an illusive goal. Ireland has signed up to a number of international and regional conventions, including the UN convention on economic, social and cultural rights, which clearly outlines the desirability of a rights-based approach to education. Economic factors even under a rights-based approach will always come into the equation but there must be recognition that the rights take priority, all other factors being considered.For all its benefits the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act did not go far enough. The Government needs to address a number of important areas. In terms of this motion, the significant number of people who have sought redress through the courts and are continuing to do so is cause for alarm. Media reports under the Freedom of Information Act point to more than 100 High Court cases having been initiated by parents of children with special educational needs. Some were taken by parents seeking compensation for failing to provide services in the past. However, most cases were taken by parents to force the Department of Education and Science to provide services for their children in recent times. Many of the cases have been adjourned and facilities for the children introduced but I am sure the Department is rightly worried that the cases will be reactivated.Another issue arises in this regard. The Department, for obvious political reasons, will try to make sure that many of the services are provided for those parents who take court cases. If this is seen by other parents to be the only way they will get facilities, more court cases will be taken over the years, and that will result in a dangerous vista.Parents mistrust the Department based on past record and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act does not go far enough to restore confidence. As stated in the motion, I express my concern that court action is still seen as somewhat of a necessity rather than a luxury.Where resources are provided schools and parents still have to deal with the spectre of the proposed weighted system. I spoke to a number of parents around the country regarding the proposed weighted approach to allocating resources for children with special educational needs at primary school level. They are greatly concerned that their children will lose existing services. In this respect, I acknowledge, as does this motion, the statement by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, that she wishes to see a system introduced that would not result in the loss of services to any child. However, while the new weighted approach has potential to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and the unacceptable length of time it takes the Department to respond to particular specific requests for children with special educational needs, it also has a number of pitfalls. That is the reason a review of the current system needs to be completed and its findings implemented before any new weighted system takes hold. I await the publication of the review with great interest.A number of groups such as the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals Network have suggested that rather than having a weighted system, it is a way of spreading limited resources in an even way using a quota system. A real weighted system was suggested under the special education review committee in the 1990s but that was never implemented. Following the review, what is needed is a genuine weighted system with a points rating for each child with a special educational need. This would be supported by a proper and transparent national pupil database obviously only accessible to certain groups of people.Similar to my call for an audit of sports facilities by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, we need a nationwide audit of pupils and their needs. This would go beyond educational disability but it is specifically relevant to this case.I mentioned the issue of legal cases taken. If parents of children who up to now have enjoyed one-to-one resourcing for special educational needs suffer under the quota system in any way, they might be inclined to take legal action. I take on board the Minister's statement and hope this will not happen. There has been a number of such examples. Deputies Gregory and Finian McGrath mentioned small schools in the inner city and in rural areas.Another issue relates to gender in terms of the difference in the level of support given to boys and girls. While we acknowledge that boys tend to need extra support more often than girls, that does not necessarily mean that girls should suffer under a weighted system vis-a-vis the situation that pertained previously. Why we welcome the reduction in the ratio from 150:1 to 140:1 for boys, girls should not be penalised unnecessarily.Other improvements are put forward under the existing proposal such as an 80:1 pupil-teacher ratio for schools designated as disadvantaged, but there are many schools with significant numbers of pupils who are disadvantaged which do not fit into the disadvantaged category. The quota system benefits some but is it truly needs based let alone rights based and how will it work properly without additional teachers? The INTO stated that another 650 teachers are required to make the system work effectively, which we must take on board, acknowledging that the increase in special needs assistants is welcome. The INTO at its consultative conference made a number of recommendations, of which I am sure the Minister is aware. I would like to outline the recommendations but I do not have time to go into them in detail.I wish to deal with the need for the Government to fulfil its commitment to reduce class sizes for children at primary school level. In 2002, the programme for Government stated that by 2007 the class size target of fewer than 20 for children under nine years of age would be reached. There is no timeframe for this, however, it will not be reached and could appear as a last minute election promise. That is not good enough; primary level must have a reduction in class sizes not just for special educational needs cases and notwithstanding special needs assessment.Speaking of elections, last night the Green Party candidate in Meath told a forum of principals and deputy principals how the Government broke its pledge on primary class sizes. County Meath is 33rd out of 34 in the league of maximum class sizes. That is an embarrassing track record on which to fight a by-election.I support this motion and urge the Government to take on board the concerns raised by the various Opposition Deputies.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"—notes that progress has been made in the area of special needs education, including the passage of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004;—commends the Government for the significant additional resources made available for the education of pupils with special educational needs; and welcomes the legislative and administrative measures being taken by the Government to improve the framework within which services are delivered to pupils with special educational needs, their parents and schools; and—further acknowledges that there are over 4,000 more teachers in our primary schools and over 2,000 in our post-primary schools than there were in 1997, that these extra teaching resources have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional support for children with special needs, and that the Government is committed to reducing class sizes further."Listening to the Deputies, I know we can have a constructive debate on this and I welcome the acknowledgment in the motion of the level of progress that has been made. It should also be noted that in the four months since we last discussed this, the National Council for Special Education has been established on a statutory basis, 80 special educational needs organisers are working on a local basis with schools, parents, children and teachers, an extra 500 children got the benefit of a special needs assistant, new units have been opened and the weighted system, as announced last year, is being reviewed. All that has happened in four months and credit should be given that in recognising that the progress that needs to be made is being advanced.We all share the same aim, that every child should have the opportunity to reach his or her potential and it is my aim, as Minister for Education and Science, to create the environment where that can be achieved. In the case of a child with special needs, a particular targeted response is needed to enable that child develop his or her abilities, enhance his educational level and prepare him for participation in society.The record of the State over decades in providing for children with special needs has been poor. Without doubt we are now playing catch-up. In any area of historical under-provision it takes time to improve services to an appropriate level. We have accelerated our investment and efforts to ensure that people with special educational needs and their parents are provided with appropriate services in a timely, efficient and customer friendly manner. Significant advances have been made in the past six years which have made a real difference to the lives of many children with special needs and their families.We are not there yet, however, and I will not pretend we are — we have progress still to make. While I record achievement, I also acknowledge that services provided for the education of people with special educational needs, including services provided by my Department, were not always as developed as we would have liked. The recent establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the transfer of functions to it will resolve many of the difficulties that existed in the past.I remind the House of the progress made in the allocation of resources and the increase in staff in this area in the past six years. There are now more than 2,600 resource teachers, up from 104 in 1998. There are 1,500 learning support teachers, more than 1,000 teachers in special schools and more than 600 teachers in special classes. There are nearly 6,000 special needs assistants in our schools — there were only 300 such special needs assistants six years ago. More than €30 million is being spent on school transport for special needs students and more than €3 million goes on specialised equipment and materials, up from £800,000 in 1998.The scale of resource allocation has facilitated the provision of education for children with special needs in mainly mainstream national schools. However, education for children with special educational needs is provided in a variety of settings. In addition to supported provision in mainstream classes, placement may also be made in special classes and units and in special schools. Pending such a placement, arrangements have also been made for tuition to be delivered in the child's home.Where appropriate for the individual child, integrated provision with necessary supports is the desired choice of most parents. For children for whom mainstream provision is not appropriate, placement may be made in one of the 108 special schools and the 654 special classes and units located throughout the country. To appreciate the scale of improvement in the provision of resources to primary schools for special needs, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, at approximately 10,700, the number of adults providing services to children with special educational needs in primary schools today is more than half the 21,100 teachers in the system in 1998. The debate cannot question, therefore, the Government's commitment to providing resources for special educational needs.In 1998, the Government took a decision that has transformed the level of provision for pupils with special educational needs. Pupils with such needs would be entitled to an automatic response to meet those needs and the allocation of resources to meet those needs no longer depended, as it had in the past, on the limited resources that were available to meet those needs. Instead, the response was based on the nature of the disability involved and, once the required supporting professional assessments were made available, the resources were automatically allocated. It was this decision that gave rise to the enormous expansion in resourcing levels to which I have referred.While the Government decision of October 1998 authorised the allocation of significant resources, it posed significant challenges to the Administration in processing the significant level of applications which were made in response to the Government commitment. I pay tribute to the staff of my Department's special education section, the inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service for the efforts they have made to service the demands which were exacerbated by the lack of investment in the past.It must be acknowledged, however, that despite their efforts, service delivery in this area has not always been adequate to provide the level of service that pupils with special educational needs, their parents, their schools and teachers require and deserve. The Department recognised that it was neither properly resourced nor structured to deliver these services. Arising from the report of an internal planning group, which was endorsed by the Cromien report on the Department of Education and Science and its operations, the Government decided to establish the National Council for Special Education to coordinate the provision of service to children with special educational needs.The council was established in December 2003 as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. The council currently has 12 members all with a special interest in or knowledge of the area of education of children with disabilities. Since September 2004, 71 special education needs organisers have been employed by the council and deployed on a nationwide basis, with at least one SENO being deployed in each county. Each SENO is responsible for the primary and second level schools in their area and they have made contact with each of their schools and informed them of their role. A recruitment process for a further nine SENOs has been commenced by the council to bring its total up to 80 persons nationwide. In addition to the SENOs, there are 17 staff employed at the head offices of the council in Trim, County Meath.With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. The council will also co-ordinate the provision of education and related support services with health boards, schools and other relevant bodies. This will help those parents who find it difficult to get speech and occupational therapists because it will now co-ordinate the delivery of services for the child.The people with whom we deal in the special education area frequently raise the issue of the lack of co-ordination between the health services, with parents feeling excluded from such decisions, and the role of the teacher locally. Placing organisers in the locality will enable them to work with the parents and the schools, particularly to co-ordinate the services on a local level, ensuring that when a child has been identified as having a special need, the services can be put in place immediately.The special educational needs organisers are responsible for ensuring that all special educational needs in their areas are addressed in an effective manner. They are charged with facilitating access to and co-ordinating education services for children with special needs in their areas. They will do this by liaising between local providers of educational services, necessary ancillary services, the council, the Department and parents. In many cases provision will be based on individual education plans for the children involved.The SENOs were recruited in an open, competitive process and all have previous experience of direct service provision to people with disabilities and have wide-ranging experience from which the whole system can benefit. The SENOs who have been appointed are being assigned responsibility for specific primary, post-primary and special schools in their areas. The council and the Department have put transitional arrangements in place to ensure a smooth transfer of functions. The establishment of the NCSE will greatly enhance the provision of services for children with special educational needs and will result in a timely response to schools which have made application for special educational needs supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council's operation through the SENOs will provide a focal point of contact for parents and guardians and for schools and will, I am confident, result in a much improved service for all.Arising out of the ongoing review of the resource allocation process, it was clear that the automatic response was operating in a manner that was far from automatic. The reality was that every single application had to be accompanied by a psychological or clinical assessment and had to be processed individually. The requirements of the process diverted school principals and psychologists from other work and delayed the processing of applications. The process was both cumbersome and time consuming.In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, has developed a model of general teacher allocation for these disability categories. This model, which was announced in 2004, to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard, as Deputy Gogarty accepted.The logic behind having a general allocation model is to reduce the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments, and put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools and greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils' special needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.I am, however, very conscious of difficulties that could arise regarding the model announced last year, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. For that reason I announced in October that I would have the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting representative interests, including the National Council for Special Education. I have received a number of submissions from around the country and these have been taken into consideration. The views of the council, which is comprised of people with a particular expertise, will be considered as part of this review.I have made it clear that I am in favour of using a general allocation model to ensure that we have in place a permanent resource in our primary schools to cater for pupils with high incidence mild disabilities and learning difficulties. However, it will not be as announced last year. The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks, in time to be implemented for the next school year. The revised system will reduce the administrative burden on schools and allow them to concentrate on the delivery of services to pupils with special needs. It will also allow psychologists to devote more time to advising teachers on planning for individual children and for whole school provision. It will reduce pressures placed on principals, teachers and psychologists by the previous allocation system, which was time-consuming and could delay the allocation of resources for special needs. Action had to be taken to reform the system and the model now being introduced will, over time, significantly improve the capacity of the system to cater for children with special needs in a speedier, more effective way. In the lower incidence disability categories resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications.Judging by some of the comments made tonight, there seems to be some confusion about that. It has always been the case that the more serious disability will continue to receive individual allocation. It is important that where there is a particular and special need in the low incidence category these children are considered individually. The resource will be allocated to them according to their individual needs. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education and the organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.The general allocation model will allocate an appropriate level of resources to schools. The deployment of those resources is, as it should be, a matter for the schools and in particular for school principals in consultation with their staff. The needs of children change over time as they develop and as programmes devised by their teachers take effect. I know it is the aim of every parent that their child would have no need for a resource teacher. The best people to recognise such a need are the class teacher and the principal. Decisions in this area are best taken at school level rather than at a remote distance by the Department of Education and Science.My Department has supported and will continue to support schools and principals through the provision of advice and not least through the support of the national educational psychological service. Applications for special needs assistants will continue to be made on an individual level in accordance with the criteria set out by the Department. The criteria referred to a significant medical need for such an assistant, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function, or where the child's behaviour is such that he or she is a danger to himself or herself, or to another. There was a significant care element included in those criteria. It is important that we continue to highlight that because the last thing we want is that children should become unnecessarily dependent on a special needs assistant. I know it is the aim of parents that where possible that dependency should reduce over time to give the child the skills to survive in school and in society in a more independent fashion. The processing of these applications for special needs assistants has been transferred to the National Council for Special Education with effect from 1 January last.In addition to the changes made in the delivery of resources to date, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 provides a map for the future development of special educational needs services. The Act reflects the Government's commitment to putting in place a strategy to address the needs of people with disability. It will begin in steps over the next few years, in accordance with an implementation plan to be drafted by the National Council for Special Education. The Act creates enforceable rights to an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs, the development of an individual educational plan and the delivery of education services on foot of the plan. It also ensures that the resources necessary to vindicate those rights will be available to schools, the Health Service Executive and the council.Resources are of major importance to the provision of the service. There are duties on the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children, and Education and Science to ensure that adequate resources are provided for the delivery of services. In particular the Minister for Finance is obliged to have due regard to the State's duty to provide for an education appropriate to the needs of every child under the Constitution and the necessity to provide equity of treatment for all children.One of the principles underpinning the Act is that parents must have a right to be consulted and fully informed at every stage of the process. If they feel their views are not being fully recognised or the plan is not being implemented effectively, they have a right to appeal decisions concerning their children to an independent review board. The board will have the power to compel bodies, including the Health Service Executive, to take specific action to address matters before it. Nothing in the Act will restrict the right of recourse to the courts, rather it will simplify the process of enforcing the right to an appropriate education through the appeals board and the introduction of a mediation process prior to full scale litigation if the parents remain dissatisfied with the appeals board's findings. None of us wants to see parents forced to go to court. We would much rather see the resources that go into fighting court cases put into the delivery of services. That is the aim and, I believe, the outcome of this Act.Of equal significance is the facility under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 which provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil. Separately, the National Educational Welfare Board can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The welfare board has indicated that it will treat children for whom an appeal under section 29 has been unsuccessful as priority cases in offering such assistance. While the rights under section 29 and the assistance of the NEWB are not limited to children with special educational needs, they nevertheless provide an important mechanism for parents of all children in attempting to resolve difficulties surrounding enrolment issues. The rights of the parents are protected to ensure that they are satisfied with the provisions of the findings on the needs of the child and the services to be provided for that child. I appreciate that previously parents of children with special educational needs felt they had little option but to resort to the court to meet the educational needs of their children. I am confident that increasingly parents will not find such actions necessary in the light of the extensive funding and statutory measures the Government has introduced to provide for the special educational needs of our children.The Cornhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 will provide an advocacy service for parents, so that in addition to the support to be provided by the special needs organisers there will be another source of advice and support for parents. Taken together the provisions of the Acts amount to a comprehensive framework to address the gaps in the system, a framework which deals with the issue not in aspirational terms but gives parents the means to enforce their rights easily and quickly.The Opposition motion referred to the full implementation of the recommendations of the task force on autism. These recommendations provide an invaluable basis for the development of educational services and supports for persons with autism. However, in responding to the recommendations, my Department has had to give priority to a number of key areas before detailed individual recommendations can be addressed. These key areas involve the implementation of the core legislative and structural measures required to underpin service development and delivery. This approach is critical to the implementation of many of the individual recommendations of the task force including those relating to assessment, parental involvement, service delivery, information dissemination, promotion of inclusion and co-ordination between health and education authorities.The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has been enacted while, on the structural front, I have already outlined the position on the establishment of the NCSE on a statutory basis. These developments represent significant progress and I am confident they will have a positive impact on services for children with special educational needs, including those with autism. The issue of the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the task force continues to receive detailed consideration within my Department. This work will be carefully planned and executed over the coming months in consultation with the council and other interested parties.However, it is the case that my Department has already acted on many of the recommendations of the task force and it is continuing to develop the network of special educational provision for children with autism. The extent of progress can be measured from the fact that, since 1998, when autism was first recognised as a distinct special educational need, the number of dedicated facilities that have been developed is as follows: 141 special classes for children with autism, attached to special schools and mainstream schools, have been created, ten pre-school classes for children with autism have been established, eight autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism, are being funded, and five special classes for children with Asperger syndrome have been created.My Department sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home-based applied behavioural analysis programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement. In addition, the task force on autism put forward a range of important recommendations in the area of continuing professional development. The Department continues to address these recommendations, on a phased basis, through existing supports, through newly established structures and through specific interventions.Some developments worthy of note are the establishment of the special education support service in September 2003, the provision by the Department on an annual basis for 140 places on a post-graduate diploma programme in special educational needs and 20 places on a postgraduate programme in autism. The Department also funded the development of an applied behaviour analysis training programme in Trinity College Dublin and funded the participation of 12 teachers on the course in 2003-04. The successful participants are now available to the Department, as classroom teachers and as a further training resource.The role of the special education support service is to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The service is hosted in Laois Education Centre and is funded by the Department.As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the special education support service has established teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas of autism, challenging behaviour, dyslexia and inclusion at post-primary. This training is delivered locally across the State through the education centre network. In addition, the service provides immediate responses to requests from schools for support in a variety of autism-related areas. The service also funds the provision of on-line training courses, including a course on autism, during the summer months of July and August and during the autumn and spring terms. The service funds approved approaches to the teaching of children with autism such as picture exchange communication system known as PECCS and Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children known as TEACCH and the Hanen approach.Another major landmark in the development of autism specific services was the joint launch last month by my predecessor and the Minister with responsibility for Education in Northern Ireland of the Middletown Centre for Autism to which the Deputies have referred in the motion. This marked the successful completion of the purchase of the former St. Joseph's Adolescent Centre, Middletown on behalf of the Department of Education in the North and the Department of Education and Science in the South. Both Departments plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders.Four key services will be provided by the centre: a learning support service on a residential basis, an educational assessment service, a training and advisory service, and an autism research and information service. The motion further refers to the matter of accelerating delivery of the Middletown Centre. A number of working groups are continuing to address the legal, financial, organisational and infrastructural aspects of the proposal. For example, work is continuing on the development of a campus masterplan for the Middletown property which, when complete, will guide the commissioning of any necessary infrastructure and refurbishment works. In addition, the process for recruitment of a chief executive officer to operate the centre is being formulated.The steps taken in recent years and those in hand represent significant progress in the development of services for children with autism. However, I fully recognise that further progress is required and my Department in consultation with parents and existing service providers will seek to ensure the recent rate of development is maintained.The record of this Government in the area of special education is one of action. We have greatly expanded the level of resourcing for pupils with special needs. We have put new structures in place through the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, which will improve and speed up the delivery of services to pupils with special needs their parents and schools. For many years there was a deficit of recognition for these children or their needs. It is because of that we can point to so much development and so much resources in the past six years, as well as further improvements that I hope to put in place to meet the needs of the children more efficiently. We have also provided a comprehensive legislative framework to govern the delivery of these services. During my tenure as Minister for Education and Science I will look forward to making further improvements in services for pupils with special educational needs.On the issue of the pupil teacher ratio in our schools and the class sizes at primary level, significant improvements have been made in recent years. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.The allocation of posts for children with special needs and improvements to the staffing schedule have helped ensure the overall pupil teacher ratio in primary schools has improved substantially. The type of improvements implemented include: the appointment and retention figure for the first mainstream class teacher has been reduced to 12 pupils; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools where there are nine or more teachers including ex-quota posts; the enrolment figures required for the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools and Gaelscoileanna have been reduced; the allocation of resource teacher posts to either individual schools or to a cluster of schools where a need has been identified; the allocation of teaching posts to schools where 14 or more pupils with significant English language deficits are identified and the allocation of additional learning support teachers.As a result of the allocation of these extra teaching posts, the pupil teacher ratio at primary level has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97.Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break-Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. It is interesting to note, in light of the figures quoted by some Deputies, in regard to the OECD figures that the outcomes from the classes in Ireland are far better than those with smaller classes in some of the OECD countries. However, we can only reduce class sizes on a phased basis having regard to the available resources. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and pupils in junior classes. Obviously there are factors in respect of teacher supply and the work which has been done in that area.My colleagues will expand on the work being done in that regard in tomorrow's debate. As I have outlined in my contribution, it is evident that in the past six years, particularly in the past few months, substantial progress has been made in providing services for children with special educational needs to ensure they are given the opportunity, in an environment suitable to their needs, to reach their potential, while recognising that the progress which has been made must continue.

This motion is on a matter of grave importance to many children, families and schools throughout the country. I wish to speak on the motion in my capacity as education spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party.However, I cannot speak to a Sinn Féin motion without first expressing Fine Gael's deep concern and disgust at the revelations of criminality which have come to the fore in recent weeks regarding members of the republican movement. I and my parliamentary colleagues have listened to the recent verbal gymnastics of representatives of Sinn Féin with a growing sense of outrage and disbelief. It is difficult to swallow the expressions of sympathy by Sinn Féin for children with special educational needs, given its links to an organisation that has made orphans of children on this island. I remind Sinn Féin that those children are real people too.In speaking to this important motion, I will not forget that the Sinn Féin Deputies in this House do not regard the murder of a young mother as a crime, battle on behalf of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and do not recognise the legitimacy of the Garda Síochána. This evening I will not forget that Sinn Féin election material turns up in peculiar places, surrounded by most peculiar electioneering tools, and that a man convicted of membership of an illegal organisation——

While the main thrust of the motion is towards the enhanced provision of resources and supports for children with special educational needs, it calls for more generalised improvements in primary education through the reduction of class sizes.Of principal concern is the introduction of the weighted system for the allocation of special educational resources and I welcome the Minister's statement tonight that the scheme will not be in the same form as was announced last year.Historically, children with special educational needs were poorly provided for within the education system. However, in 1998 with the advent of the Education Act, a clearer intention was signalled to provide education for children with special needs. This was followed by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, which was a flawed document in many ways when first presented. Fine Gael tabled more than 300 amendments to that Bill and, by working with parties, ensured that the Act significantly improved upon the presented Bill. The Minister at the time, Deputy Noel Dempsey, accepted many Opposition amendments.Following the Education Act 1998, a number of circulars issued from the Department of Education and Science. One of these, circular 08/02, is of particular interest. This departmental missive listed, in appendix one, categories of disability and the corresponding number of hours per week that a pupil experiencing such difficulties should expect. Circular 08/02 acknowledged the need of children for resource teaching hours. For example, for borderline and mild general learning disability, the weekly allocation was listed as 2.5 hours. A similar 2.5-hour allocation was indicated for children with a specific learning difficulty, such as dyslexia. However, just before the schools closed for summer holidays last year a new procedure was instigated and the details of this new departure were included in circular 09/04. This was the new weighted system which the Minister has dealt with in her contribution.In appendix one of this more recent circular, the specific time allocations for the categories of mild general learning disability, borderline mild general learning disability and specific learning disability have disappeared to be replaced with the words "Access to SET support-weighted model". When the former Minister for Education and Science was questioned on the result of the implementation of this circular, he stated clearly that some schools would lose resources under the new arrangements. I am pleased that the Minister is considering a revision as I believe it cannot be allowed to continue.Where resources have been allocated to meet assessed needs, the needs do not change and the resources should remain in place. Why was no mention of this system made in the lengthy discussions on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act? It would have been a major mistake for the Government to have continued in the direction in which it was heading with circular 09/04. Following her statement tonight will the Minister clarify whether from September 2005, children with special educational needs will be entitled to the allocation of resource hours as was their right under circular 08/02 or whether this will change? These 30-minute per day allocations cannot be lost. It is not the appropriate response from the Department of Education and Science, which should seek to meet learning needs and not curtail its response to them. The Minister has provided the House with some explanation in her contribution tonight as to the reasons for the weighted system.

#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	280	My party raised this issue last October but we did not receive a clear reason from the Minister for proceeding with this system. Why is the Minister now changing the system if she believed her own reasoning? The reasoning was flawed because the situation was not improved in the case of many children. As the previous Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, admitted, it would disimprove the lot of many children.I remind the Minister that learning difficulties come in many guises. The appendix to circular 09/04 lists 14 disabilities that come under the consideration of that departmental directive. I again ask whether this will be changed. The Government must realise it cannot neglect borderline, milder or specific learning difficulties to meet the needs of students with more moderate or severe difficulties. All students are entitled to be treated equally and fairly. Borderline and mild difficulties can become compounded if ignored over time. In addition, children with specific learning difficulties can be assisted, but can also suffer a considerable lack of confidence and educational attainment if they do not receive the right help at the right time. In my experience and in that of my party colleagues, since last summer many children with borderline and mild difficulties are being ignored. To put it bluntly, it appears that their disability is neither obvious enough nor apparent enough, nor is it causing enough disruption in the class to warrant attention from the Department of Education and Science. It is this new direction which causes me most difficulty. There may be no circulars specifying it but it is certainly one of the single biggest issues that I deal with in my constituency offices and clinics, and I know other Deputies have the same experience.Children who up to this year had 2.5 resource hours teaching per week find they have none because they no longer fall within the Department's guidelines. It does not seem to matter that their psychologist, the only person making a decision who has met and examined the children in question, has recommended that they need resource hours. Their parents who know the child better than anyone feel that they need this help. The teacher who has the child in his or her class every day believes that the child should be given extra assistance. The resource teacher who had previously been teaching the child is of the opinion that much more progress could be made if the child could continue with the resource hours.What will the Minister say to the parents of a six year old boy whose psychologist recommends he attend a special school because of his speech problems and discrepancies between his verbal and performance domains and who cannot even get resource hours from the school he is attending? The only response given is "number of hours recommended, zero". What will the Minister say to the parents of a little boy whose school has been unofficially giving him five resource hours per week and which is allowing him for the first time to make what his mother described in a letter to the Minister last December as "slow but steady progress", but the Department is refusing him resource hours from September of this year, despite the assessments recommending this? What will the Minister say to the numerous parents whose school principals have told them that they will have to await the outcome of her review of special education and the introduction of the weighted system before their children will receive resource hours?The nonsensical situation still remains that young boys and girls are allocated special needs assistance but only until lunchtime or 2 p.m. when the school day continues to 3 p.m. Despite promises, this situation has not been improved in many instances.Referred to also in this motion is the commitment to reduce class sizes which was made by the Government in An Agreed Programme for Government 2002. The commitment made was clear and unambiguous and stated that over the next five years, maximum class guidelines would be introduced to ensure that the average size of classes for children under nine would be below the international best practice guideline of the ratio of 20:1. The importance of this commitment should not be underestimated. It is somewhat surprising that the Minister for Education and Science so casually discarded this commitment last year.By describing this undertaking as a "noble aspiration", the Minister entirely failed to take account of the conviction of those in the education sector and the parents of children being taught in crowded conditions that this was not an aspiration but a sincere promise. At the time the Minister withdrew from this commitment, her Department stated it would take at least 2,000 extra teachers to meet the target and that it was not feasible to recruit this number in the time set out in the programme for Government. I dispute these figures and I have always thought that the Government was hiding behind the fig leaf of teachers' supply when they simply do not want to hire the additional teaching staff.The INTO claims the target was achievable and pointed to the fact that almost 2,000 new teachers would be trained over the coming year. This figure included those graduating from St. Patrick's College and Mary Immaculate College as well as the smaller colleges. The reduction of class sizes is a very important step in improving general primary education. There are currently approximately 215,000 children under nine in classes from junior infants to second class of whom over 80%, 170,000 children, are in classes with more than 20 children. The average Irish class size is 24.5 while the OECD average is 22. Most EU countries have significantly smaller class sizes. It is unacceptable that today more than 110,000 children are in classes of between 30 and 39 in number.The Government amendment to the motion notes the extra resources being allocated to tackle educational disadvantage, yet there is no evaluation of the results of this investment. One thousand children per year are still failing to make the transition from primary to post-primary school. The Education Welfare Board is still critically underfunded and the problem of truancy is greater than anticipated. Fine Gael and the Labour Party raised this issue in the House last October. The Special Education Council, which had been planned long before then, has since been established. How much longer must children wait?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on a topic which touches every citizen, namely, the need to address the educational needs of our nation's children. I will focus first on the psychological assessment of children in primary schools. While this debate concentrates on the important issue of the provision of services, psychological evaluations of children with special educational needs and those experiencing difficulties in school are vital. Whether one's child attends a school covered by the National Educational Psychological Service can be a simple matter of geography. For example, whereas in some counties almost 100% of general primary schools are covered by NEPS, the figure in County Clare is 27%.The failure to address special needs of children is closely associated with educational disadvantage and is a major contributor to early school leaving. This phenomenon has wide social repercussions. We must ensure that improvements promised in special educational needs are delivered to meet the special needs of children as of right and for the good of society.The Barnardos 12-year strategy published in January last shows that, of those experiencing difficulties at school, children with special needs are falling through the cracks in the State's educational services. Children are not being assessed in time and, as a result, not assisted on time. Confirmation in the Barnardos report that 1,000 children per annum do not make the transition from primary to secondary education demonstrates that the Government's actions are not good enough.I heartily endorse calls on the Minister to improve and enhance supports for children with special needs, especially in the context of the Disability Bill 2004, which was before the House today. The system pertaining to special educational needs proposed by the Minister could have a detrimental effect on smaller schools. For example, if the Department proceeds to implement the allocations announced last June, special educational needs provision in County Clare could be decimated. The ratio being applied for special educational needs nationally is one special needs assistant per 240 pupils, which is much too high for small schools, including many in my constituency, particularly west Clare. This approach would require a teacher to double as a learning support teacher and resource teacher for special needs.The Minister stated that so-called lower incidence children, the bottom 2%, would receive additional hours. Notwithstanding this provision, current special needs assistants would still be badly hit by the proposed ratio, which will result in fewer teachers working with children with special needs than is currently the case. For example, in terms of teacher equivalents, including part-time teachers, County Clare could face a loss of 20 full-time special needs teachers. The Minister's approach means small schools, of which there are many in west Clare, will be hardest hit. Irrespective of the progress being made at a broader level, the people of County Clare will not accept a loss of services for children with special needs or learning difficulties.It is necessary to acknowledge that some progress has been made and resources for special needs have improved in some schools in recent years. Many children receive the support of special needs assistants and the current level of support sustains many of them throughout primary school, although special needs pupils are often in classes of up to 30 pupils. Considerable praise must be reserved for parents who sought to vindicate the rights of their children in the courts. It is regrettable that in many cases they were forced to do so in the face of significant opposition from the Department.While it is important to acknowledge the Minister's sanction in October last year of 295 additional special needs assistants to support children in almost 500 schools, the response to special needs applications is much too slow and must be speeded up. The House must insist that applications for special needs supports are processed as quickly as possible and every child is given the necessary resources once his or her requirements become known at school. Children's needs must be assessed as a matter of priority. As Deputy Enright noted, many children who have received special needs assistance until junior level are left unsupervised, perhaps for an hour in the afternoon, when they move to first class. As the INTO in County Clare has demanded, this matter must be addressed immediately. The Government must provide what is needed, when it is needed for the good of all our children and the wider society.

All Deputies are contacted regularly by parents concerned about children who require a special needs assistant or other needs met. As the Minister pointed out, it is important to look after children from a young age.Although I agree with her that we must have an automatic response to meet the needs of pupils, it is a pity her Department does not pursue such a policy. If such a policy was at the top of its agenda, I and other Deputies would not need to table parliamentary questions regarding specific pupils every week. I accept the Minister was appointed only recently and wish her luck.I will give two examples from the many cases of parents who visit my clinic. Two weeks ago, I received a call concerning a child with a major behavioural problem. The school indicated that its teachers were no longer able to facilitate the pupil because of his behavioural problem. The boy in question comes from a broken family and is being looked after by his grandmother. It is sad that a child has been sent home from school because teachers are unable to look after him. The grandparent of the child has had a number of meetings with the board of management and principal of the school. I would love to be able to tell the grandparent that, having spoken to the Minister, a special needs assistant will be provided for the child and everything will be fine. Unfortunately, I will not be able to do so due to red tape, which is worse in the Department of Education and Science than in the Department of Agriculture and Food.

Another case I have encountered involves a parent who has a child with a behavioural problem attending a special needs school. The child in question was kicked off a bus by a driver and the parent was told that the child's behaviour could not be tolerated. The woman in question travels 90 miles per day from the heart of the Enniscorthy district to Wexford and back because of a child's behavioural problem on a school bus. She was offered 60 cent per mile to bring her child to school. When I asked her whether it would not be much handier to have an assistant on the bus, she replied that the Department was not prepared to provide an assistant but had offered her money to bring her child to school. It is neither acceptable nor fair that a parent must travel 90 miles per day to take a child to school.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue. It has been a cause of concern to me for some considerable time, as I am sure it has for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.It relates to the application of the new rules, as annunciated in last year's budget, which imposed restrictions in regard to amount and eligibility in terms of the rent allowance scheme, thereby affecting many who would previously have qualified. In the row between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as to where responsibility should lie in the provision of housing, as evidenced by exchanges in this House, it is the applicants for this scheme who have suffered.Typical of the current situation is that the applicant is told to seek a house for which the rent is low. A house for which the rent is €400 per month in my constituency is one which is not fit for habitation. There is no option other than an unfit house for that type of rent. Moreover, if an applicant finds a house that is rentable and supportable in the view of the local health board, he or she is forced to undergo a variety of bureaucratic turns and twists. If the applicant survives this, he or she will be exhausted and in some cases homeless.I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is fully aware of the seriousness of this situation. I raise this issue in the knowledge that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has indicated in the past that he is fair and caring. A sufferer of Crohn's disease in my constituency, whose PPSN is 6857327Q, has been run around the system for the past four months. This person was refused the rent allowance and told to return in six months. It is disgraceful that his needs have not been addressed. Another constituent, whose PPSN is 6788230R, has spent most of the past 12 months attempting to apply for rent allowance. On each occasion, some excuse has been given as to why she is not entitled to avail of the scheme. This person has been chased from pillar to post by the antics of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, through the local health board.I do not wish to denigrate any Department. However, the current situation is intolerable and I hope the Minister of State will do something to rectify this. A by-election will take place shortly in my constituency and I can ill-afford to be here on this errand. However, I have tried every other approach. I have heard the comments of social welfare officers to the effect that it is of no avail to bring such issues to one's local public representative because the officer is the only person who counts in these matters. The day is fast approaching when those who adopt this attitude will get their answer.The cases I have listed are genuine and those concerned are entitled to have their applications dealt with in a sympathetic manner. I could say much more, which might be inflammatory. I will refrain, however, on the basis that I expect an immediate resolution to the issues I have raised.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this issue and apologise for the absence of the Minister. The rent supplement scheme is administered on the Minister's behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has no role in determining entitlement in individual cases.A number of measures were introduced in the rent supplement scheme in January 2004 to re-focus the scheme on its original objective, which is the provision of short-term income support as opposed to long-term housing solutions. A working group was subsequently established under the Sustaining Progress agreement to facilitate engagement with the social partners in monitoring the impact of the changes to the scheme. In its report in August 2004, the group concluded that the new measures were not having any significant adverse impact having regard to the design of the measures, including the operation of the levels of discretion by community welfare officers. As part of the ongoing monitoring of the rent supplement scheme, the working group was reconvened last November to undertake further examination and consideration. I understand the group is in the process of drafting a report on its latest deliberations.In the meantime, based on the work of the social partners and other consultations, the Minister introduced new regulations on 31 January 2005 to make two significant changes in the conditions for receipt of rent supplement. First, the requirement regarding six months of prior renting was abolished to ensure that bona fide tenants may access rent supplement in appropriate circumstances. Rent supplement may now be paid where applicants have been established in rented accommodation from within their own resources but can no longer meet the payments because of a change in circumstances, such as illness or redundancy. In addition, rent supplement continues to be payable where there is an assessed housing need and the applicant is unable to meet this from his or her own resources and also in other specific circumstances.Second, the rules relating to the refusal of local authority accommodation have been eased. Up to now, rent supplement was not payable where a person refused, within a 12-month period, a second offer of local authority accommodation. Rent supplement may now be paid unless a person has refused, within an 18-month period, three offers of accommodation from a local authority.In regard to the four cases raised by Deputy Durkan, none of the four was affected by the measures introduced in January 2005.

Coincidentally, the last issue I requested to raise on the Adjournment also referred to this company, in regard to the brewers' strike. Fortunately, that issue was resolved and I thank the Minister's office for the support and assistance received at that time.The loss of 150 jobs has both saddened and angered my constituents, many of whom are my friends and neighbours. I empathise with those employees and their families but, sincere as this sentiment is, it will not put food on their tables, petrol in their cars, pay their rent or mortgage or offer any of the other provisions which require a weekly pay packet. I promise to ensure that every effort will be made by the relevant Ministers and appropriate State agencies to attract and support alternative employment in this part of west Limerick. These job losses add to others in the area. The Kerry Group has announced the closure of the chicken processing plant in Kantoher with the loss of 140 jobs. O'Reilly's Fruit and Veg., a food preparation, packaging and distribution business, recently announced its closure. In Drumcollogher, Drum Engineering Limited is also about to close its doors.This close-knit area of west Limerick has taken a proverbial hammering. It is now time for the closing of ranks across the political divide, rural communities and State agencies to show support and solidarity to our friends, colleagues and neighbours. This is at a time when such support is badly needed. Playing politics and ranting and raving in front of broadcasting microphones will not replace a single job. Neither will playing the blame game. We must work together to encourage and promote small business ventures. Those brave enough to take commercial risks must get the assistance they deserve.I was heartened by the initial reaction of the ATGWU regional organiser in the area, Mr. Seán Kelly, who did not rave and rant. Instead, he immediately accepted the company's offer to enter negotiations to minimise job losses. From his comments, I understand the figure of 150 job losses is not written in stone. We must provide for the long-awaited and necessary financial investment deserved by a diligent, committed and responsible workforce. We must ensure that Castlemahon Food Products Limited, synonymous with west Limerick like Kantoher Chickens, will grow with confidence, increase its market share, improve wages and conditions and become profitable and viable, giving employment to future generations.Will the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, investigate why jobs are being shed in the agrifood sector, which has been so successful in the past? Is it due to competition from imported products? Our population is growing and, with it, our food outlets, but we are shedding jobs in the chicken processing industry. I appeal to all parties concerned to ensure that as many jobs as possible are maintained at Castlemahon. I have full confidence in the trade union officials involved and management to save as many jobs as possible.My thoughts tonight are with those who will lose their jobs at the Castlemahon plant. Of the 410 employees in the company, 150 will lose their jobs. The employees have not been told, however, who will be affected. This is a difficult situation for those individuals. I hope that those who remain in employment at Castlemahon will have viable jobs into the future. For those unfortunate to lose their jobs, I hope they will be re-employed as soon as possible in the locality.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I share Deputy Cregan's concerns for those workers affected by the recently announced job losses at Castlemahon Food Products Limited. The decision by the company to lay off 150 staff has been taken in the context of a major restructuring programme designed to improve its cost base and to secure its future operation. This is a commercial decision by the company. Castlemahon is owned by O'Kane's Poultry, Ballymena, County Antrim, a major Northern Ireland poultry operator, and the announced restructuring is part of a groupwide initiative. Castlemahon has been an important employer in the Limerick area. While the company will seek to achieve the reduction in numbers through voluntary redundancy, there will be huge disappointment among affected employees and their families. There is never a good moment to announce a restructuring that causes job losses. However, decisions that have broader strategic aims are quite often critical in securing the sustainability of an organisation and maintaining jobs.The company has indicated that it will retain 260 full-time jobs and, therefore, will continue to be a vital element of the west Limerick economy. Last year, Castlemahon Food Products Limited processed approximately 10 million chickens, accounting for 15% of national throughput. The company intends to maintain and possibly increase the volume of poultry throughput. I urge it to work towards this objective. Approximately 60 farmers are engaged in the rearing and supply of chickens to the Castlemahon company, making a valuable contribution to agricultural incomes in the area. I am glad there is no threat to this. The Castlemahon-O'Kane group has a significant presence and experience of selling in the UK market. Getting its cost base down is essential to its ability to compete in that market. I am optimistic that the company will continue to be a successful and significant contributor to the poultry sector.My Department has been in contact with Enterprise Ireland on the matter. For some time, Enterprise Ireland has been engaging with the company and will continue to work with it to develop the existing business and secure optimal production levels and sales. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has stated that the full services of FÁS will be made available to any workers who wish to use those facilities. Particular services of relevance to affected workers are those relating to retraining and upskilling. This will be of assistance to them in getting back into the labour force at the earliest opportunity. Fortunately, west Limerick is well serviced with industries by several major employers in the area. My Department will continue to maintain a permanent veterinary presence at the plant and will assist in every way possible in its ongoing operations.The poultry industry is a competitive sector due to the increased volumes of poultry meat imported from low-cost countries outside the EU. Nevertheless, the volumes of poultry produced in Ireland have remained at satisfactory levels for both producers and processors, with an increase of 4% in 2004. The poultry and egg sector is an important part of the overall agrifood industry, with a farmgate value of €150 million. The sector provides valuable employment, supplying quality products to the domestic and export market. Last year approximately 66 million chickens and 10 million birds of other species were slaughtered, maintaining high level continuity of production in the face of increased competition from imported products.Despite increased import penetration, the poultry sector is a net exporter, when the valuable processed products sector is taken into account, contributing €244 million to our balance of payments. Increasingly the industry, in common with other sectors, must face up to the pressures of severe price competition from lower cost products from abroad, a fact of international trade. The trading environment is undoubtedly difficult. Tight controls on costs, full capacity utilisation and economies of scale are essential to the prosperity of the indigenous poultry industry.The Castlemahon company announcement is aimed at strengthening its cost competitiveness and placing it in a better position to adapt to the current international market environment. Both the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, are concerned at the job losses in this area and will take action on the matter.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment.Last Friday, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced that approximately €2.5 million of capital and staffing grants were to be made available for several child care projects. While it seems a good news story, when read between the lines it is disappointing for those who provide child care services, particularly those in disadvantaged communities. The parents in such communities only have one opportunity to see their children cared for in such a fashion. For the past three years, the 36 community child care services in Cork city and the 12 in the greater Cork area have been in receipt of staffing grants from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, at the end of last year in December 2004, a letter issued to all these voluntary and community-based child care providers stating that funding would only be in place on a roll over basis until 31 August 2005. This has contributed to a great deal of uncertainty in the provision of the service, low staff morale and a great deal of fear among the parents of children catered for in this way, because they will not be able to cater for their child care needs in the commercial sector.The announcement of these capital and staffing grants has been greeted with a great deal of derision despite the suggestion that disadvantaged communities would be catered for. Not one allocation has been made in Cork city despite the suggestion that particular emphasis would be placed on communities rated as RAPID or CLÁR communities. In the four RAPID communities in the Cork city area, including one in my constituency, none received an allocation.It is unfortunate the response to this Adjournment matter will be from a Minister of State who is not even attached to the Department concerned. I hope by placing my concerns on the record, we will at least get a more honest response from the Government because hidden in the detail of the press release issued last Friday was an indication that of the promised €90 million for child care — that is, for current and capital expenditure and other associated costs —€50 million has been spent to date by the Government. It seems the largest part of the remaining €40 million and the additional money the Government has promised in a ten year envelope will not come on stream until 2007.As an Opposition Member, I must admit that I can only treat such an announcement cynically. Given the importance of child care, decisions will be made to remove services now but to introduce additional funding in the run up to the next general election. If that is the Government's strategy, it is letting down many disadvantaged communities, child care service providers and the parents and children who depend on the barely adequate infrastructure that exists.The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is hardly in a position to reply comprehensively to the issues I raised but I hope he will communicate them to his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or, if he is able to find him, to the senior Minister if his ego rush has eased down in recent days. As the senior Minister in that Department, he has an overall responsibility to meet a need that everyone in this Houses accepts must be met. I am very angry the Department, with this latest small tranche of additional funding, has caused disappointment and confusion about Government policy in this area. I would like a response as to how child care service needs will be met and properly resourced in my constituency and in the greater Cork area.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I apologise for the absence of the Minister but I assure Deputy Boyle the views he expressed will be passed on. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and for giving me the opportunity to update the House on the important issues of child care and its development in Cork city and county.Child care is an important priority for the Government and it has increased funding for this important sector on a number of occasions since it first made commitments to the broad child care sector in 1998. The equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-06 is a key element of the national development plan and its original funding package of €318 million set as recently as 2000 has increased to €499 million to be spent within the life of the national development plan or before the end of 2007.The funding package has increased because the Government is aware of the importance of providing child care to support the economy and to support social inclusion through labour market participation. The Government has listened to requests from many groups, such as those in Cork, seeking to build child care facilities to meet local needs. The Government has responded to those requests by making more capital funding available immediately rather than awaiting a follow-on programme to build on the momentum which has been generated by the EOCP in community groups throughout Ireland.Capital and staffing grant applications for funding under the EOCP from groups in Cork were submitted to the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform. The EOCP is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.The demand for capital grant assistance from groups such as those in Cork was such that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform considered it important to increase the capital provision for the current programme. Following discussions with his colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, additional capital funding of €90 million was made available over the period 2005-09 in the context of the 2005 budget. Of this amount, €50 million is being made available under the current programme and the remaining €40 million will flow under the next phase of the post-2006 EOCP. The total funding available for the programme is €499.3 million and includes an increased provision of €205 million for capital developments.Efforts are being made to achieve a good geographical spread through the appraisal and approvals process. Cork city and county has been approved more than €30 million under the child care programme with 134 capital grants approved to establish either new or quality enhanced community-based not-for-profit or private child care facilities. The county has also benefited from 112 staffing grants to community groups that have a focus on disadvantage. This funding to child care providers in Cork city and county will lead to the creation of more than 3,400 new child care places and to the support of more than 3,100 existing places. Cork city and county child care committees also receive annual funding to support their developmental work.The Deputy referred to an announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of an allocation of almost €2.5 million in February 2005, which did not include any allocation for the greater Cork area. However, the Deputy may also be aware that the Minister announced to community-based not-for-profit groups in December 2004 an allocation of almost €35 million in capital funding, which included an allocation of almost €3.2 million to groups in Cork city and county.The availability of the additional capital funding will enable the Minister to make further capital grant assistance available over the coming months and years to groups which address significant child care service gaps and where the project proposal represents good value for money. In light of this, groups in Cork have been advised that while their projects were not prioritised for immediate funding in December 2004, they are being reconsidered with all the other applications on hand. The Minister hopes to make further significant capital commitments during 2005 and thereafter to good projects which link with the aims of the programme in supporting child care needs of parents in employment, education and training, offering value for money and filling a service gap in their local area.Expenditure under the programme covers the period to end-2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times. Every county has benefited from considerable support for new child care facilities under the EOCP. In all, funding to create some 33,254 new places has been approved to date. This will, when fully drawn down, bring an increase of nearly 60% in the number of centre based child care places throughout Ireland since the start of the programme in 2000, well ahead of original expectations.The Minister understands from the Area Development Management review that support allocated to the city and county of Cork under the EOCP compares very positively with other counties in the southern and eastern region. The EOCP is the Government's response to the need to develop a child care infrastructure to support parents. There has been significant progress in creation of a good child care infrastructure and the Minister hopes the Deputy will acknowledge the progress made to date in the city and county of Cork and will be reassured that every step is being taken to further develop services in the area as expeditiously as possible.

The initiative is aimed at identifying barriers inhibiting small food producers, ranging from the scale of the enterprise, access to funding and distribution, marketing and promotion as well as the provision of skills and training and the regulatory environment. Achievements to date under this initiative include completion of a needs analysis with small food producers, Leader groups and agencies supporting the small food sector; holding of regional seminars with Leader groups; liaison with statutory agencies and producer groups to develop areas of co-operation; development of a small food business development training programme, in co-operation with FÁS services, for small businesses in the Cork-Kerry area covering areas such as finance, marketing, development of sales skills, distribution and quality management; completion of guidelines to assist Leader groups in establishing farmers markets and voluntary codes of practice; and compilation of a database of farmers markets; issue of templates and guidelines for the development of regional food guides to Leader groups.My Department maintains regular contacts with the relevant Government Departments and statutory agencies, such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Bord Bia. Arising from that, the co-ordinator has recently being appointed as a member of the FSAI artisan forum.

The review is being overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department, and comprising representatives from a number of relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. A comprehensive consultation process was undertaken as part of the review and PA Consulting Group was engaged to assist the steering group in its work.The review is examining the progress made to date in implementing the strategy and identifying future priorities for the remaining period up to 2008. The review is also examining the relevance of the strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of drug misuse in Ireland, including emerging trends.I expect the steering group to report to me by mid to late March. I will then be making recommendations on the way forward to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion at the earliest opportunity.

While I would not like to predict with certainty that this ambitious target can still be met on the nail, I can assure the Deputy that work is proceeding as speedily as possible within my Department. A further milestone in the process was reached only last week when, on Wednesday, 16 February, I launched the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on proposals for reform of charitable trust law.The Law Reform Commission agreed to assist and advise my Department in addressing certain governance issues as they relate to charitable trusts. The consultation paper represents a specialist contribution towards achievement of the Government commitment to regulate the charities sector for the first time in Ireland. The intention is that the outcome of the public consultation would be available to my Department for consideration during the course of preparation of the draft legislation.As to what new information has been made available on our charities regulation webpage, at http://www.pobail.ie/en/CharitiesRegulation/, the press release which I issued on the occasion of last week’s launch can be found there; and the consultation paper itself can be accessed via the hyperlink on the webpage to the Law Reform Commission’s website.

Expenditure on that programme in the period February 2004 to end January 2005 was €21.677 million. This funding supports 185 community development projects, CDPs, in communities experiencing social and economic disadvantage. These projects provide facilities such as meeting rooms, crèches, office facilities and training or education projects to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups in their communities. The programme also includes groups that act as a resource for community development work with particular interest groups, for example, Travellers, lone parents, people with disabilities and ethnic or cultural minorities. The programme is designed to reduce poverty and social exclusion through targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from economic and social development. Funding for the community development programme has been increased to €22.4 million for the 2005 year.My Department provides a range of once-off grants to a wide variety of locally-based community and voluntary groups. Funding of approximately €3.3 million was provided in the past 12 months for grants in the following categories: equipment and refurbishment grants — targeted at voluntary and community organisations in disadvantaged areas; and education, training and research grants — providing once-off payments to fund training, education or research initiatives aimed at supporting and enhancing the effectiveness of local community and voluntary groups in disadvantaged areas.The scheme of community support for older people encourages and assists local support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. Funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations, which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. My Department provided funding of approximately €2.5 million in the past 12 months under the scheme.In 2004, €3.2 million was paid in grants to county-city development boards to fund cohesion and better delivery service projects which have been proposed by various agencies under the improved co-ordination of local and community development schemes.In 2004, there was a provision of €42.144 million in my Department's Vote for the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP. Funding was allocated to partnerships and community partnerships and territorial employment pacts to deliver the programme under three measures — services for the unemployed, community based youth initiatives and community development.Capital funding of €4.5 million was available in 2004 to support small scale localised actions in RAPID areas, through co-funding with the relevant Department or agency. Funding of €1.3 million was also available to support ADM and local areas in the implementation of the RAPID programme.Details of the areas covered by LDSIP and RAPID are available on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie.The PEACE II programme is a distinctive EU Structural Funds programme aimed at reinforcing progress towards a peaceful and stable society and promoting reconciliation. My Department, through ADM-CPA, implements 12 measures of this programme that range from developing community infrastructure to new skills and new opportunities. Funding of €10.615 million was provided in my Department's Vote to meet commitments under the programme in 2004.My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.In this context, my Department has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces in Dublin, Cork and Bray and the ten regional drugs task forces located in all areas of the country. The Department also funds the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects and the young people's facilities and services fund development groups which are based in the 14 local drugs task forces areas, as well as in Carlow, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.In 2004, my Department spent over €27 million on the above areas. In addition, an amount of over €6.5 million was transferred from the Vote of my Department to the Vote of the Department of Education and Science in early 2004 for mainstreamed young people's facilities and services fund projects.An amount of €21.98 million was provided in 2004 for schemes to benefit communities in Gaeltacht areas, including road improvement, marine works, group water schemes, leisure facilities and cultural initiatives. In 2004, a capital allocation of €10.35 million was available for island development purposes. While the greater part of this funding was spent on essential public infrastructure on the islands, a proportion was also allocated towards community led projects such as recreational facilities and community centres.My Department also provided funding of €33.183 million in 2004 to Údarás na Gaeltachta to assist in developing industries, services and employment opportunities, in addition to fostering and strengthening the Irish language, in Gaeltacht areas.In the past 12 months, CLÁR funds of €10.9 million were spent on the various measures under the programme. This expenditure supported the provision and improvement of facilities ranging from roads, water and sewerage, village, housing and schools enhancement, health, broadband, electricity conversions and sports and community projects.Under the programme, community groups availed of assistance under the measures detailed in the appendix set out below.The rural development fund, provided for in the White Paper on rural development, was established to support research, evaluations and pilot actions mainly in disadvantaged rural areas. In the period in question the fund supported a number of initiatives including training in traditional skills; employment of local development workers; local tourism development projects; and the employment of a co-ordinator to examine barriers facing small food producers. A total of €582,634 has been spent on the rural development fund from February 2004 to end January 2005.My Department provides support to rural communities under the Leader+ initiative and the area based rural development initiative and the rural development initiatives of the cross-Border programmes INTERREG IIIA and PEACE II.The essential aim of the Leader+ initiative, which has a public contribution of some €73.7 million, is to encourage new approaches to integrated and sustainable development in rural communities. The initiative is in place in 22 areas throughout the country.The area based rural development initiative has a public contribution of €75.6 million. The initiative complements the Leader+ programme and ensures the availability of funding in the 13 areas that were not appointed to deliver the Leader+ programme. Funding for rural-agritourism is provided from this programme on a nationwide basis. In addition, the three collective bodies, Muintir na Tíre, Irish Farmhouse Holidays and Irish Country Holidays that are not eligible under Leader+, receive assistance under this programme.The rural social scheme was introduced in 2004 to focus on the provision of direct services in the community and at the same time to ensure an income for small farmers on long-term social welfare benefits with a working week compatible with farming.There are 1,114 participants on the scheme at present. There are 36 implementing bodies throughout the country and of those 27 have commenced projects under the rural social scheme to date.My Department continued to provide support to rural communities in the past 12 months under the rural development initiatives of the cross-Border programmes INTERREG IIIA and PEACE II.Under the INTERREG III Ireland-Wales Programme 2000-2006 there is a rural development and diversification measure to promote the economic and social well-being of the rural communities in INTERREG target areas. The total funding package for this measure is €10 million, 2000-06. To date over 60% of this funding has been committed.The rural initiative measure of the INTERREG IIIA Ireland-Northern Ireland Programme 2000-2006 aims to develop and strengthen the rural economy in disadvantaged cross-Border areas. The funding package amounts to €14 million over the period of the programme, 2000-06. To date, €5.9 million has been committed.Funding is also provided in two measures under the PEACE II Programme 2000-2004, promoting rural community networking in marginalised rural communities and rural development co-operation and diversification. The funding package for both measures amounts to €5.7 million, of which over 60% has been committed.The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which is currently responsible for overseeing the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts, comes under the aegis of my Department. The board is an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. Funds from dormant accounts are targeted at assisting disadvantaged groups and communities and assisting persons with a disability. During 2004, the board approved 420 projects for funding totalling approximately €42 million.

The provisions of the draft EU regulation, which will apply to the period 2007-2013, include diversification of the rural economy through, for example, development of micro-enterprises and rural tourism. Implementation will be through a local development strategy based on the Leader methodology. The negotiations on the details of how these arrangements, including funding, are to be implemented continue at EU level.

The survey was co-funded by the commission, my own Department and by Foras na Gaeilge. The BCI published the results of the survey on 20 January 2005 and I intend to discuss those results with the relevant parties in the near future.As I have already outlined to the House, this issue was brought forward in the context of the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta and in subsequent discussions by the advisory committee established by me to advise in regard to practical actions to implement the recommendations of the commission. Responsibility for the overall issue of establishing any such radio service on a national basis would rest with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

I understand that discussions have already taken place on these issues.The provision of this once-off funding to the Health Service Executive by my Department for this improved service represents another positive and significant measure in the practical implementation of the recommendations of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta and will help to ensure that the language is carried forward in the Gaeltacht as a living spoken language to the next generation. It should be noted that the grant was sanctioned on the understanding that the Health Service Executive would assume full responsibility for funding the initiative after the first year.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	326	In accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, a comprehensive reform of the law relating to charities will be brought forward to regulate the sector for the first time in Ireland. As I informed the House on 14 December 2004, the content of the draft legislation would be likely to reflect the proposals in the Government-approved Consultation Paper on Establishing a Modern Statutory Framework for Charities, which received a broad overall endorsement in the public consultation phase last year.While it would not be possible at this stage for me to predict with certainty that the best estimate which I gave last year of end 2005 for publication of the draft Bill can be met on the nail, I can assure the Deputy that work on preparation of the draft legislation is proceeding as speedily as possible, and that it is being given priority within my Department. In the context of the overall timeframe, I might also recall that I advised the House on the same occasion last December that the draft legislation would involve statute law revision and restatement, in addition to the new regulatory provisions. Going forward, therefore, we would be looking at a future charities regulation Bill of substance in vision, content and size.

The scheme recognises that farmers have a wealth of experience and talents that need to be preserved for future generations and these talents are being harnessed for the good of the community. This scheme focuses on the provision of direct services in the community.There are 1,114 participants on the scheme at present. There are 36 implementing bodies throughout the country and of those 27 have commenced projects under the rural social scheme to date. I expect the participant numbers will continue to increase and that all 2,500 places will be availed of in the near future.

The report of the investigators was submitted to the Departments and actions to be taken on foot of the report have been agreed with the chief executive of Waterways Ireland.The issue of a joint statement by the Departments in the matter is under consideration. I will arrange for a copy of any such statement to be supplied to the Deputy.I welcome this opportunity to again acknowledge the efforts of the chief executive and staff of Waterways Ireland in advancing the work of this important North-South body, often in complex and difficult circumstances. As I stated in the House last December, the promotion of North-South co-operation in areas within my Department's remit remains a high priority for me and I will continue, in particular, to support the work of the North-South bodies responsible for inland waterways and language matters in every way possible.

However, as I have stated previously, there appears to be an anomaly in relation to Ballyfermot, which despite meeting the criteria for inclusion in strand I of the programme, was omitted due to its inclusion in the URBAN II programme. I have met representatives from Ballyfermot in relation to this issue and I am awaiting their proposal.

Details of the contracts awarded by my Department are listed in Appendix 1, and details in respect of bodies under the aegis of the Department are listed in Appendix 2.The PR consultancies listed were not engaged previously by this Department during the lifetime of the current Government.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	331	My Department does not have a figure for the total weight of waste disposed of per year. We have a figure for the quantity of paper waste disposed of — the amount in 2004 was 104,000 Kg. All paper and cardboard waste is recycled. Paper waste is disposed of through a private contractor, Leech Papers Limited. This contractor also removes cardboard free of charge for recycling.Redundant photocopiers are removed by our current suppliers, Toshiba Ireland, who comply with the EC directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, and the EC directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, RoHS, on the disposal of photocopiers.During 2004, my Department had three areas of IT hardware disposals. These included: empty toner cartridges are boxed and collected by a company called Ergo Services for recycling. As part of this arrangement, Ergo Services donate a sum for each toner cartridge returned to them for recycling to The Jack and Jill Foundation charity; hardware that is still useable but not good enough for newer applications is made available for reuse. A number of these PCs were disposed of to staff in my Department, for a nominal fee, while others were given, free of charge, to a charity called PCs for Africa and to schools-community groups; and hardware which could not be recycled-reused was disposed of in 2004 to a company called Systems 2000 following a tendering process. This comprised 62 monitors, 42 PCs, 11 laptops, 12 printers, 47 keyboards, one scanner and two routers. None of this equipment was of any further practical use.We are in the process of putting in place arrangements for recycling of cans and plastic bottles.General waste is removed by Dublin City Council. We are continually reviewing the possibility of increasing the amount of such waste which can be disposed of by recycling. Most stationery used by my Department is recycled paper.

If the person does not know the name of the agency involved, he or she may contact the Adoption Board for advice. The Adoption Board working with the various representative groups is currently finalising plans for a contact preference register which will aim to facilitate contact between adopted people and their natural families. This register will initially be established on an administrative basis, but it also forms part of the adoption legislation proposals approved by Government in December on foot of the adoption consultation process.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the assessment of applications for medical cards. The periodic review of eligibility and the frequency of such reviews are also matters for the HSE's local area to consider and determine. However, the HSE takes into account the circumstances of each case when setting the renewal dates. Reviews are necessary to ensure the medical card databases are accurate and that public accountability issues are addressed.On the issue of children with very serious illnesses, an operational group overseeing the medical card scheme has been asked to put processes in place that limit the need for frequent reviews in these cases, where a review would normally result in automatic renewal of the medical card. Persons aged 70 years and over have a statutory entitlement to a medical card since 1 July 2001, otherwise applicants, including those who may suffer from the diseases mentioned by the Deputy, must apply to the local area of the HSE to have their cases assessed on the basis of income and medical need.Under the Health Act 1970, the HSE may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme. The conditions are mental handicap, mental illness — for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis were added to the scheme in 1975. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for chiropody services. The provision of chiropody services is a matter for the local areas of the HSE. There is no statutory obligation to provide these services; but nationally, a variety of arrangements are in place for the provision of chiropody services; however, there are no plans presently to introduce a statutory scheme. It was discovered that chiropodists in the former ERHA area were imposing additional charges for their services on medical card holders. My Department informed the authority that it was inappropriate to impose such charges and it recently wrote to the HSE with a view to getting an early resolution to this matter.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	348	On 29 March 2004 most enclosed places of work became smoke free. The primary purpose of this measure is to protect the health of workers and the public from exposure to toxic second-hand tobacco smoke. The Deputy will appreciate that decisions in regard to workplace safety are not influenced by considerations relating to their effect on trade. A survey on the smoke free workplace measure commissioned by my Department was carried out by a market survey company and published in August 2004. The figures show that of those surveyed 82% support the smoke free at work measure; 90% agreed that going smoke free is of benefit to workers; 82% agreed that it benefits everyone in public places; and 95% agreed that the legislation is a positive health measure.The survey reported a positive response to socialising in smoke free hospitality venues with a majority of people confirming that the new smoke free legislation improved their experience in pubs, 70%, and restaurants, 78%. More than half of respondents, 53%, indicated that they would be more inclined to eat in a pub since 29 March 2004. Research carried out by Fáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority, in respect of 2004 shows that 97% of visitors would recommend a holiday in Ireland. With regard to the smoke free measure, the research showed 77% of overseas visitors were in favour with 26% saying they would be more likely to holiday in Ireland as a result and 5% saying they would be less likely to holiday here.With regard to the impact of the smoke free workplace measure on sales of cigarettes, alcohol, food and beverages my Department has not commissioned any research. However, provisional figures from the Revenue Commissioners indicated that sales of cigarettes have decreased by 10% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The media have reported that beer sales in licensed premises have declined in recent years and this is ongoing. However this is being attributed to a number of factors and not only the introduction of the smoke free measure.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 with the intention of financially helping those who chose private nursing home care over public long stay care. It was intended to help with the costs of this care for people who could not afford to pay the full fees involved, but it was never envisaged the scheme would cover the full cost of care. To this end a means test was employed to ensure that the available funds were allocated to those most in need. Some €5 million was allocated to the scheme in 1993 and that figure has risen to more than €120 million in 2005.There are currently three rates of subvention payable under the regulations, that is €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The above rates, which include a 25% increase from April 2001, were set by the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005.

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for orthodontic services. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a number of measures have been adopted to improve orthodontic services in the HSE mid-western area and on a national basis.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the former health boards funded 19 dentists from various health board areas for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 19 trainees for the public orthodontic service include six dentists who successfully completed their training in September 2004 and have taken up duties with the HSE. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork dental school. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. My Department has given approval in principle to a proposal to further substantially improve training facilities for orthodontics at the school, which will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region, including the HSE mid-western area, under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long term illness scheme, LTI. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness, for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis were added to the scheme in 1975. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.Prior to 1971, there was inadequate provision for assistance to people with large ongoing medical expenses. The purpose of the LTI scheme was to protect patients with a specified condition from excessive drug costs, by providing free drugs and medicines to treat that condition only. Following the establishment of the GMS scheme in 1971, to provide free treatment for those who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange to provide it for themselves and their dependants, various co-payment schemes have been introduced to provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for non-medical card holders with significant ongoing medical expenses, without restriction to the treatment of a particular condition. Since 1999, non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the LTI have been able to use the drugs payment scheme, DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.In light of the protection from excessive drug costs provided by the GMS and DPS schemes, there are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions under the LTI.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The forum on fluoridation was established to carry out a review of the fluoridation of public water supplies in Ireland. The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation. The forum produced a comprehensive and conclusive report which it presented in 2002. In its report the forum set out a number of conclusions and made a number of recommendations with respect to the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The main conclusion reached by the forum was that the fluoridation of public water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The forum also recommended the establishment of an expert body to implement the forum's recommendations.The Irish expert body on fluorides and health held its inaugural meeting in April 2004. The terms of reference of the expert body are to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research — including new emerging issues — on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his or her request or on its own initiative. The expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride in the future.The Dental Health Foundation was established more than 20 years ago as a charitable trust dedicated to raising the profile of oral health in Ireland. Its establishment was initiated by the dental profession with the agreement and support of the Department of Health. The foundation plays an important role in facilitating and supporting the promotion of oral health in line with the Department's 1994 dental health action plan. It works closely with the Department's health promotion unit, providing a focus for oral health within the wider context of health promotion in Ireland. In 2004, my Department provided funding of €120,500 to the Dental Health Foundation in its role providing the secretariat for the Irish expert body on fluorides and health.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I regard the report of the national task force on medical staffing as a significant contribution to the development of acute hospitals services and to the organisation of medical staffing.The report makes important proposals for reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in line with the European working time directive. It highlights the need to implement changes in medical staffing to ensure safety and quality of patient care and to reduce significantly the unacceptably long working hours of NCHDs.The Hanly report recommends a significant increase in the total number of consultants, working in a "consultant provided", team based system, so that patients can receive faster access to senior clinical decision making. The report also deals with medical education and training with particular reference to the changes that will be needed in the context of a 48-hour working for NCHDs.Regarding the organisation of hospital services, I consider that the report proposes an appropriate way forward in terms of regional self-sufficiency, investment in hospital services and the organisation of those services around hospital networks. In line with these recommendations, I will continue the Government's planned investment in new hospital facilities and additional consultant posts. This approach will be to the benefit of all patients.The national hospitals office is best placed to further the recommendations of the Hanly report regarding hospital services. While the acute hospitals review group which was to carry out this work will not now proceed, Mr. David Hanly who chaired the report of the national task force on medical staffing will continue to be available for advice on the reform process.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Births and Deaths Registration Acts 1863 to 1996 include a provision for the correction of an error of fact or substance in a register of births, which allows for a correction on foot of a statutory declaration setting out the errors in the entry in question. These provisions may be used to remove erroneous details from a birth entry. The Acts also include provisions for the entry of paternity details in the register of births in respect of children born to parents who are not married to each other.The Status of Children Act 1987 amended section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland) 1880 by the substitution of sections 7 and 7A. Section 7A sets out the procedures for the re-registration of a birth to include paternity details where the birth was initially registered without such details being included. As it would appear from the information furnished that a man has been named in the entry in the register of births, the provisions of section 7A may not be availed of in the case referred to by the Deputy.However, if the Deputy were to furnish details to an tArd-Chláraitheoir, including details of the putative father, he could investigate to see what measures, if any, can be taken to resolve the matter, either under current legislation or the provisions of the relevant parts of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which are due to be commenced in the near future.

In addition to quantifying the level of assaults and making recommendations on prevention, the report contained proposals for a scheme of compensation for psychiatric nurses who have been seriously injured as a result of an assault by a patient in the workplace.Government approval would be required for the introduction of any new State compensation scheme, which would be additional to the existing serious physical assaults scheme, last revised in 2001. The serious physical assaults scheme provides enhanced sick pay arrangements for nurses assaulted at work. Medical expenses are also refunded. In circumstances where a nurse is certified permanently unfit to resume duty he or she may be paid five sixths of full salary until retirement.In late 2003 a draft memorandum for Government was circulated and during the consultation process, complex legal and financial issues emerged on aspects of the scheme proposed by the task force and their implications for the health service and the wider public service.In March 2004 the Psychiatric Nurses' Association and SIPTU were advised that particular concerns had been raised concerning the proposed scheme. In the meantime officials from my Department have been in consultation with the Department of Finance and the office of the Attorney General. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the issues involved are very complex and have far reaching implications for the health service. I expect to be in a position to provide more definite information shortly.

The service has been operating since December 2002 and to date it has received more than 95,000 patient contacts. Westdoc has 107 general practitioners providing service to public and private patients in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.A patient satisfaction survey, independently conducted by the National University of Ireland, Galway in July 2003, found that patient satisfaction with the Westdoc service is very high. A further patient satisfaction survey will be conducted in 2005. The funding provided to the Health Service Executive's western region for the expansion of out of hours co-operatives since 2000 is contained in the following table.200020012002200320042005Total€0.076 million€0.159 million€2.059 million€2.575 million€2.7536 million€3.5536 million€11.176 millionThis dedicated funding does not include fees paid to participating general practitioners.During a recent visit to Galway, I met a delegation from east Galway who expressed concerns about the operation of Westdoc in their area. In particular they raised issues about the considerable distances that some people were required to travel to access a doctor.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Health Level 7, HL7, is one of several American National Standards Institute accredited standards developing organisations operating in the health care arena. Its mission is to:provide standards for the exchange, management and integration of data that support clinical patient care and the management, delivery and evaluation of health care services. Specifically, to create flexible, cost effective approaches, standards, guidelines, methodologies, and related services for interoperability between health care information systems.HL7 standards are being adopted worldwide as crucial elements in creating the environment necessary to support the delivery of integrated, person centred health services, by making relevant information available as appropriate to authorised care professionals.In 2003, the HL7 messaging standard was adopted by the health service, through the work of the former health boards executive's messaging project, as the national standard for appropriate messages. As new messages are developed, they will be built to conform to that standard. Selected messages between a number of hospitals and general practitioner offices have been developed and are being delivered, conforming to this standard. It is intended that further secondary care to primary care linkages will be made, particularly between hospitals and general practitioners, as the underlying information and communications technology systems are made ready to receive them. As new information and communications technology products and services are acquired for the health service, appropriate components will be required to confirm to the HL7 standard at the time of acquisition, or to have a clear plan for ensuring such conformance within a reasonable timeframe.

This matter will be dealt with by each nursing home and institution giving the opportunity to discuss the matter with the relevant local staff. The Health Service Executive is working with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this regard. The emphasis is on ensuring choice is given to those who are in a position to exercise it and that the best interests of the patient are maintained at all times.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The practices of charging or seeking a contribution from clients with a disability in residential care who had income which may include a disability benefit or allowance has been common practice. Following the Attorney General's advice that there was no legal basis for such charges, the health agencies were instructed to stop charging for long-stay care on 9 December 2004. The situation concerning contributions sought for rent or other expenses was further clarified by the Department in a letter issued on 23 December 2004.The Health Service Executive has obtained legal advice on these practices which supported the Department's decision in December to cease charging or the payment of contributions by eligible persons. My Department is considering the extent to which these practices are affected by the Supreme Court decision of 16 February 2005 and this will be taken into account in the detailed operation of the repayments scheme which I expect to put in place shortly.

Such schemes, which have been administered by the Irish Red Cross, provided for the relief of hardship and were not compensation for losses or a substitute for insurance. The aid was not designed to put victims in the position they were in before the catastrophic event but to alleviate extreme hardship and to assist flood victims in restoring their lives to some semblance of normality.The local authorities are the housing authority in their respective areas and there are no plans to involve the Irish Red Cross in cases where houses have been damaged beyond repair. Arising from the Government decision last September which approved the recommendations of the flood policy review group, the administration of humanitarian assistance in the future by the community welfare services of the regional health executive in conjunction with, as appropriate, local community and voluntary groups and non-governmental organisations is being examined.

The following table, which was provided to the Deputy in a previous parliamentary question response, outlines the old rates which were applicable up to 1 December 2004, as well as the new rates as applicable on or after 2 December 2004. It also shows relevant information available regarding the number of transactions and the stamp duty yield relating to first-time buyers who paid stamp duty in 2004 as provided to me by the Revenue Commissioners:ThresholdsFirst-Time Buyer Rate Pre-BudgetNo. of transactions for First Time Buyers (Pre-Budget)First-Time Buyer Rate Post-BudgetNo. of transactions for First Time Buyers (Post-Budget)Stamp Duty Yield for First Time Buyers%%€m€190,501 to €254,0003.003,970Exemptn/a26.7€254,001 to €317,5003.752,542Exemptn/a26.5€317,501 to €381,0004.501,06933516.4 (4.5%)0.4 (3%)€381,001 to €635,0007.50Unknown6160.4As the Deputy was previously advised, stamp duty rates for property transactions exceeding €381,000 up to 1 December 2004 and for transactions exceeding €635,000 on or after 2 December 2004 were the same for all purchasers and, therefore, it is not possible to distinguish first-time buyer transactions from other transactions in excess of those values.As the Deputy was also advised, statistics on stamp duty transactions are not compiled by reference to the address of the property purchased and, accordingly, it is not possible to provide the information requested by reference to counties. Particulars of transactions where no stamp duty applies are not normally captured. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide reliable information in relation to exempt categories.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The guidelines for engagement of consultants in the Civil Service, produced by my Department in March 1999, outlines in paragraph 3.05 a number of general criteria to be adhered to by Departments in relation to consultancy projects. One of the general criteria outlined is that Departments should ensure that additional costs and-or expenses are included as part of the fee. Where this is not feasible, particular care should be taken to ensure that such costs are adequately vouched and are reasonable. Where additional costs for travelling and subsistence cannot be avoided, they should where possible not exceed those appropriate rates applying in the Civil Service. Officials in my Department are, therefore, aware of the requirement that the costs of only necessary and reasonable travel relevant to a project by consultants should be met by the Department.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	410	There are three sets of guidelines which set out the criteria in question: general guidelines on procurement, general guidelines on the engagement of consultants and new guidelines which will apply particularly in the public relations or communications area.In March 1999, my Department issued the guidelines for engagement of consultants in the Civil Service. The latest public procurement guidelines, public procurement guidelines competitive process, were issued by my Department in July 2004. Both documents are available on the Department's website. I have arranged for hard copies to be sent to the Deputy.Following consideration of the recommendations in the recent report prepared by Mr. Dermot Quigley, additional guidelines in relation to certain proposed consultancy contracts have now been agreed for incorporation in the Cabinet handbook. These guidelines will apply particularly in the PR or communications area where there is a significant element of direct service to a Minister or where a Minister has suggested the name of a person or enterprise for a consultancy or contract. The additional guidelines are in effect since 15 February. The full text of the guidelines is available on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	411	There are no tax incentives available for persons towards paying crèche fees. Over recent years, the Government has considered carefully the area of child care. It has been decided as a matter of policy that child benefit will be the main instrument through which support will be provided to parents. One of the main benefits from this approach is that, whereas tax relief would be of little or no benefit to those with low incomes, the provision of support for parents through the child benefit route means equality of treatment for all recipients.In line with this policy approach, the Government has substantially increased child benefit since coming into office in 1997. Overall expenditure on child benefit has increased by 279% from €506 million in 1997 to an estimated €1,916 million in 2005.To address the availability of services, the supply of formal child care places is being stimulated through a programme of investment under the national development plan equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP. The EOCP funds capital development to increase places, support staffing costs for facilities targeting disadvantage, and improve child care quality. Over the next five years, 2005-2009, the capital envelope for the planned programme of continued investment in child care facilities will be €313 million, which is expected to create about 17,000 places, 3,400 per annum for each of the next five years. The 2005 allocation for the EOCP provides €83.4 million of which €43.8 million is current and €39.6 million is capital funding.The Government has also undertaken measures to favour the supply of child care by tax incentives to set up facilities and relief from benefit-in-kind taxation for free or subsidised child care where this is provided by employers. Taken together, these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care and I have no plans to introduce additional measures at this time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Under section 6 of the Unclaimed Life Assurance Polices Act 2003, a life assurance policy is treated as unclaimed if, in the case of a fixed term policy, the specified term has expired, if an amount would be payable if the policyholder were to make a claim, and if the insurance undertaking has received no communication from the policyholder for a period of at least five years. In the case of a policy which does not have a specified term, these conditions are met only when a period of 15 years has elapsed without any communication from the policyholder.Section 8 of the Act sets out the procedures for notification of the holders of unclaimed policies before a transfer is made to the dormant accounts fund. The insurance undertaking must give written notice to the policyholder, at the last address known to the undertaking, of the following: the name and current address of the undertaking and any information regarding a change of name since the policy issued; that an unclaimed policy to which the policyholder appears to be entitled is held at the undertaking; that if no communication from the policyholder is received by the undertaking, the net encashment value of the policy will be transferred to the dormant accounts fund; and that the policyholder is entitled to claim the moneys payable under the policy.Where the value of the policy is €500 or less or the undertaking has been either instructed not to contact the policyholder or is unable to do so, section 9 of the Act requires the undertaking to advertise the fact that it holds unclaimed policies. In the normal course of business, insurance undertakings may contact policyholders whose policies have not yet matured for a variety of reasons unconnected with the unclaimed policies legislation. These include the requirements under the Insurance Act 1989 and the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001 referred to in to my reply to the Deputy's question of 10 February last.I understand that it is also common industry practice to send out annual communication to clients, including such information as unit allocation statements, indexation notices and annual benefit statements. Where a policy has a fixed term, such as in the case of single premium investment bonds, the undertaking will normally write out to the policyholder in advance of the maturity date to advise them that the policy is about to mature. These commercial practices may vary from firm to firm and may not extend to all types of policy.I am informed by the financial regulator that it is not aware of any complaints regarding life companies' correspondence in respect of unclaimed policies, including single premium investment bonds. However, any complaints should in the first instance be made to the regulator at: Consumer Information Department, Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, PO Box 9138, College Green, Dublin 2, lo-call 1890 77 77 77.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The Minister for Education and Science, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, issues guidelines regarding section 50 student accommodation. Under these guidelines there is a requirement for a minimum of three bed spaces per unit and a maximum of eight per unit. In this regard, I am informed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government that the 4,718 units certified and completed to date have on average 3.7 bed spaces which amounts to an average of 17,500 bed spaces. The majority of the units certified and completed relate to Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork. The following table illustrates the location of the approved units.The guidelines issued by the Department of Education and Science also contain a requirement that tax-relieved accommodation can only be let to students of a certifying educational institution during the academic year and to non-students outside of the academic year. Claims for tax relief for the capital investment in student accommodation schemes by investors are made under the self-assessment system. In this regard, a certain number of such claims are audited as part of the Revenue Commissioners' audit programme.

However, the employee tax credit may be due to each spouse against her-his other emoluments, if any.A "proprietary director" means a director of a company who is either the beneficial owner of, or able, directly or through the medium of other companies or by any other means, to control more than 15% of the ordinary share capital of the company. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics on the number of spouses of proprietary directors who are not in receipt of the PAYE allowance are not maintained and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue Commissioners' records.

Section 20(1) of the Act states that "the Commission shall not make any payment from the fund to the Exchequer before the year 2025".The reimbursement of nursing home charges is primarily a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children who, I understand, is considering the judgment of the Supreme Court and will bring proposals to Government very shortly. As the Tánaiste indicated in the House last week, the cost of reimbursement will be met from the Vote for the Health Service Executive. A Supplementary Estimate to cover the costs will be moved in due course.

The pilot project in relation to income tax experienced some technical difficulties not related to the external contractor and steps are being taken to resolve these. The essential difficulties were technical issues regarding the speed of transfer of captured data from the external contractor to Revenue, amendments to computer software rules relating to the validation of information on return forms and amendments to computer software rules used to generate computer assessments.Work to resolve these issues involving software development and testing is ongoing. It is estimated that this work will be completed by the end of March 2005. In the meantime, the income tax forms included in the pilot project are being assessed to tax in the normal manner. Overall, in excess of 92% of paper income tax returns submitted to Revenue have now been processed.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 268 of 8 February 2005.The authority to implement pension increases was delegated to An Post, subject to certain conditions, as this activity was considered part of the day-to-day operations of the company. In practice this allowed the company to implement pension increases following pay increases to employees. However, decisions outside the scope of the original delegated authority still require the consent of both the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Finance.Following a proposal from the board of An Post to amend the existing pension increase terms of An Post, in this instance, my Department and the Department of Finance undertook a review of the situation. While I fully empathise with An Post pensioners for the position they find themselves in due to the failure of An Post management and unions to reach agreement on implementation of the recovery strategy, the wider overall policy issues raised by the proposal from An Post also need to be considered.By way of background and as the Deputy may be aware, the existing terms of the An Post superannuation scheme provide for pay parity, that is, that pensions are increased in line with the pay of serving staff. This is in accordance with public service defined benefit pension increase policy generally, pay parity being an integral and well established practice which is widely applied in public service defined benefit pension schemes.Unfortunately, following examination of the issue and taking into consideration the implications of providing a precedent which could impact adversely on the cost of pensions in the wider public sector and the existing practice of pay parity, increases to pensioners of An Post linked to increases under Sustaining Progress are not possible at this time.While I understand the current frustration of An Post pensioners with the situation, agreement in partnership with An Post unions to the restructuring plan aimed at securing the future of the company and providing sustainable long-term employment for An Post workers is the way forward. With this in mind, I have urged both the unions and the management of An Post to engage fully with the industrial relations mechanisms of the State to agree a way forward for the future of the company and all stakeholders in this matter.

Consequently, the local authority put revised proposals, involving relocation of the overflow pipe, to the Department.The revised proposals were put to public consultation in December last. The submissions received, together with the county council's responses to them, received by the Department on 19 January, have been examined by the Department's engineering division. The matter will now be put before the next meeting of the marine licence vetting committee, an expert group that advises me on proposals of this nature. I understand the issues to be considered by the committee in this case will include possible impacts on fishing and fisheries as well as possible implications for the navigation channel for the port of Waterford. A decision on the county council's proposals will be made as soon as possible after the marine licence vetting committee has completed its consideration of the application.

However, the application of such a permit charge is an operational matter solely for the relevant board to decide, in this instance the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, and is not something over which I, as Minister of State, have control.I am advised by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board that it has had a permit charge for trout angling for many years on fisheries that it controls and manages in the region. I am also informed by the board that the permit income is reinvested in the conservation and day-to-day management of these fisheries.I understand that the fisheries board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the board controlled fisheries on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species on the same water was not charged. As this is an operational matter, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to address the particular queries raised and to reply directly to the Deputies.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	424	My Department is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy including biofuels and I am committed to the development and promotion of a biofuels market in Ireland's transport fuel sector. The targets set in the biofuels directive for market penetration of biofuels are indicative and not mandatory and present a challenge to Ireland given the low base from which we are starting. An interdepartmental group has been established, chaired by my Department and comprising officials from Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport, Agriculture and Food, and Finance. The group is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. As part of the work of this group, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by SEI in December which examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel. The report is being considered as part of the overall policy objective to increase market penetration of biofuels in Ireland, which is at a very low level.In March 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the scheme is to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel. It is envisaged that the scheme will encompass market development for pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol. The European Commission has confirmed that the scheme would represent a state aid and consequently its approval is required. In this regard the Department of Finance has written to the Commission seeking approval. Once the necessary clearance is granted, a commencement order will be signed by the Department of Finance and the process for project selection and approval will be implemented.Sustainable Energy Ireland is also funding a number of biomass projects and studies through its renewable energy research development and demonstration, RERDD, programme. Under the programme, Sustainable Energy Ireland offers capital grant aid for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories.

The survey was conducted in conjunction with the Lough Swilly Wild Oyster Development Association, LSWODA, and other wild fisheries interests and its findings were widely disseminated at that time. Since then a number of smaller-scale surveys of specific areas of Lough Swilly have been carried out. Most recently, a survey was conducted adjacent to the Ballygreen area, the results of which, I understand, will be reported to the Department before the end of February. At the request of the LSWODA, a further local survey of the Ryebridge area is to be carried out in the next six months by BIM and aquaculture initiative staff as before.I am advised that as a result of the work carried out in recent years, the location and extent of the Lough Swilly wild oyster beds are quite well understood. In these circumstances, there are no proposals at present for a further comprehensive survey of the oyster beds.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	426	The Fisheries Consolidation Act 1959, as amended, expressly empowers the licensing authority to make it a condition of a sea-fishing boat licence that a certain proportion of the crew of a boat shall be of a specified nationality. The requirement for a certain proportion of crew members to be of EU nationality arises from the importance of achieving the maximum economic benefit to coastal communities and the Irish economy generally from the operation of an Irish sea-fishing boat. The requirement was reduced from 75% to 50% in 2001 following representations from industry representatives. It should be noted that the recent enlargement of the European Union has increased the number of potential crew members from EU nationalities. Since this change was implemented, there has been no demand from industry representatives for any further change in this requirement. In the event that a change in the requirement is pursued by industry representatives, I will review the matter.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I propose to take Question Nos. 178 to 180, inclusive, together.The particular licence applicant referred to by the Deputy wrote to me on 31 January 2005 seeking a polyvalent sea-fishing boat licence for the vessel in question, without the provision of 100% replacement capacity, on a short-term basis. I wrote to him on 9 February informing him that responsibility for the licensing of sea-fishing boats had transferred to the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 and that I had passed his letter to the head of the licensing authority, a senior official in the Department, for direct reply to him. The licensing authority operates on an independent basis subject to certain criteria and implements licensing policy in accordance with ministerial policy directives.I understand that the licensing authority, which had previously met and written to the individual concerned about this matter, replied to him on 10 February and again explained that sea-fishing boat licensing policy does not permit the licensing authority to license the vessel without full replacement capacity being provided in advance. It pointed out that ministerial policy directive 2/2003, issued to the licensing authority on 17 November 2003, makes it clear that the 1:1 replacement capacity requirement applies other than in limited specified cases. I understand that the licensing authority recently agreed to extend, by three months, the period of validity of the licence offer issued to the individual concerned to give him more time to comply with licensing requirements.On the question of "short-term" licences, no statutory period is specified in respect of which sea-fishing licences may be granted. Subject to any overriding licensing policy considerations, this is an operational matter for the licensing authority which can issue licences having validity for any period of time in the interests of efficient management of licensing and taking into account any other relevant issues such as safety requirements.The licensing authority had, up to 17 February, issued six new sea-fishing boat licences for the polyvalent fleet segment since the beginning of this year. Full replacement capacity was provided in all cases prior to licensing, as required under general licensing policy. The licensing authority has, since 1 January 2005, issued six renewal licences in respect of vessels in the pelagic fleet segment. The six vessels concerned have been licensed in accordance with section H of policy directive 2/2003, as amended, which specifically sets out the manner in which replacement capacity must be provided by vessel owners in the pelagic segment in respect of works previously claimed as "safety tonnage".

In preparation for the United Nations high level event in September which will assess global progress towards meeting the MDGs, the EU has decided to take on a leadership role by promoting initiatives on aid financing, policy coherence and a special initiative on Africa. Ireland has been a leading proponent of a strong EU role in promoting the MDGs, including during our 2004 EU Presidency, and we have submitted a national report to the European Commission on our contribution towards meeting the MDGs.With regard to overseas aid, the allocation for 2005 provides for an increase of €70 million in Government spending on official development assistance, ODA, this year. This will bring total Government aid to the developing world to approximately €545 million in 2005, the highest allocation in the 30-year history of the aid programme. Further increases of €65 million will be given in each of the years 2006 and 2007. This means that over the three years from 2005 to 2007, €1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance. The welcome advantage of these multi-annual commitments, recognised and recommended by the last OECD review of our aid programme, is the ability to plan on a long-term basis and to give our partners in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere predictability of funding.The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target for expenditure on ODA. The issue of how best to meet the target and in what timeframe is under ongoing review. In the coming months also, Development Co-operation Ireland will launch a consultative process that will lead to a White Paper on development assistance. All interested stakeholders are being invited to submit views.On the issue of trade, Ireland has constantly stressed the needs of developing countries in the negotiations on the Doha development agenda. The former Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, Deputy Kitt, took part in Ireland's ministerial delegation to the world trade talks in Cancun in September 2003. At EU ministerial level, Ireland has stressed the need to take on board the concerns of developing countries, including in the area of special and differential treatment. The European Commission is engaged in negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states to conclude regional economic partnership agreements, EPAs, which will enter into force at the beginning of 2008. While a number of points of divergence remain to be resolved, Ireland supports the EPAs since they are intended to promote sustainable development and poverty eradication in the ACP countries.The situation in Darfur in Sudan is a source of particular concern. The United Nations and the Security Council have been centrally involved in efforts to address the Darfur crisis and with this in mind are, inter alia, assessing the possibility of strengthening the implementation of the UN arms embargo and broadening it to include the Government of Sudan. At national level, the Irish Government will continue to use all avenues open to it to urge action in addressing the humanitarian, security and political challenges which exist in Darfur. In 2004, Ireland provided more than €10 million in humanitarian support to Sudan generally, of which €6.38 million went to Darfur. Additional funding will be delivered in 2005.With regard to a global arms trade treaty aimed at preventing arms transfers which undermine human rights and sustainable development, I am aware of a process led by a number of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, including Amnesty International and Oxfam, aimed at the conclusion of an international arms trade treaty. This treaty is intended to be a legally binding agreement with core principles and mechanisms relating to international transfers of arms. While work on the drafting of the text is still ongoing, it is a promising initiative and I commend the NGOs concerned for their efforts. My Department will continue to be associated with the process and will closely monitor developments. Officials from my Department are attending a meeting on this subject in Tanzania this week.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I propose to take Question Nos. 188 to 196, inclusive, together.The legally binding Cotonou Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states and the European Union provides for the negotiation of economic partnership agreements, EPAs, between the parties. Since trade is a European Community competence, the European Commission negotiates the EPAs between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP states on behalf of the member states. The Commission provides member states with regular updates on the progress of the negotiations. The EPAs are to enter into force by 1 January 2008.The EPAs are first and foremost instruments for development that will foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy with due regard for their political choices and development priorities, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication in the ACP countries. They combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework while taking account of the specific economic, social and environmental circumstances of each regional group and its component states. By enlarging ACP markets through regional integration and by making regulatory frameworks in these countries more transparent, EPAs can create an environment conducive to the private sector and thus function as a vehicle for long-term economic development.According to Article 37(7) of the Cotonou Agreement, the negotiations on the EPAs:shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries, and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process. Negotiations will therefore be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.While Ireland, like the other member states, does not participate in the ongoing EPA negotiations, we are generally satisfied that the Commission is discharging its mandate in accordance with these provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It is clear from the most recent EU-ACP joint report of October last on the state of play of regional EPA negotiations that the process with the six regions is conducted with considerable concern for its impact on the economies of the ACP countries. As in all trade negotiations, the EPA negotiation has brought to light differences of approach between the parties in a number of areas. It is to be hoped that as the talks progress, these divergences can be resolved in accordance with the principles and objectives underlying the negotiations. However, it is not helpful for the success of the EPA project at this stage to suggest taking action at the WTO for a continuation beyond 2008 of the preferential access of ACP countries to EU markets.All the programme countries in Ireland's bilateral aid programme — Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Timor-Leste — are ACP states. Our underlying approach in those countries is complementary to that of the EPAs in that we are sensitive to the need to help build the economic architecture in these least developed countries so that they will be able to avail of an improving international trading environment. To that end, Ireland works both with its partner governments and with other donor countries to ensure a real focus on economic development and employment generation and on helping to equip our African partners to pursue access for their goods and progressively the means to avail of that access.Within Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for trade policy. An officer of that Department represents Ireland at meetings of the 133 committee. The committee normally meets once a month at the level of full members. An officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs also attends meetings of the committee on a regular basis.Given the importance for Ireland of trade and trade relations with other countries, including those which are programme countries for Ireland's development co-operation programme, there is close co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Food, in preparing for meetings of the 133 committee and on questions relating to trade generally, including the EPA negotiations.

The closing date for receipt of applications under the current programme was 31 July 2000. No application was made in respect of the Gus Healy swimming pool in Douglas before that date.The programme's priority is to support the proposals on hand. New proposals for swimming pools are not being considered at this time. The Department is conducting an expenditure review of the swimming pools programme, which is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to areas where pools have been built under the existing programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. The review is expected to be completed by the middle of the year. The question of re-opening the programme can be considered when the review has been completed.In a letter dated 16 December 2004, Cork City Council requested a meeting with me to discuss grant aid towards the refurbishment of the public swimming pool in Douglas.

An expenditure review of the local authority swimming pools programme is under way in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and is due to be completed by the middle of the year. As part of the review, all data on the number and location of swimming pools promoted by local authorities throughout the country, some of which date back to the 1960s, are being updated. The Department's existing records are not complete because they relate to projects which were grant aided, whereas local authorities have always been able to construct swimming pools without reference to the Department. Local authorities have not been required to update the Department on the status of grant aided swimming pool projects after they have opened to the public. The expenditure review is seeking to update all records in this area.Some 55 projects are being dealt with under the current round of the swimming pools programme, which closed for applications on 31 July 2000. Some 25 of those projects have been grant aided, of which 15 have been completed. The completed projects are located in Arklow, Courtown-Gorey, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Wicklow, Roscommon, two in Tralee, Ballinasloe, Finglas, Grove Island in Limerick city and Clonmel. Ten projects are under construction, in Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Cobh, Youghal, Churchfield in Cork city, Drogheda, Letterkenny, Jobstown in south County Dublin, Monaghan town and Tuam.Some 30 projects are at various stages of the programme. Two projects are at tender stage, in Killarney and Ballybunion. Some 13 projects are at contract document stage, in Askeaton, Athy, Claremorris, Clondalkin, Dunmanway, Glenalbyn in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Longford, Naas, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Skerries, Thurles and Tullamore.

The work of the interdepartmental working group, which was established in 1999 to advise on key issues relating to the operation of a public private partnership approach to swimming pools, will be taken into account as part of the review process. The experience of local authorities, national legislative and policy developments in the area of PPPs will also be pertinent.The arrangements and accompanying guidelines in place for PPPs are geared towards major and complex capital projects with significant ongoing maintenance requirements — projects with a capital cost of €20 million or more. The PPP model should be used where it is appropriate and where it can deliver value for money. The model would not be appropriate where the transaction costs of pursuing a PPP are disproportionate to the value of the project. The policy framework for PPPs in the local government sector issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the implementing guidelines issued by the Department of Finance are detailed and complex in implementation terms.The project costs in the local authority swimming pools programme are in the region of €8 million and are not seen, therefore, as being of sufficiently high cost to justify the extra resources involved in pursuing a formal PPP approach. The Department of Finance confirmed some time ago that there were several considerations which would militate against a PPP approach to this programme and that pool projects do not strictly comply with the definition of a viable PPP in terms of scale and optimal transfer of risk to the private sector.It is important to consider that the swimming pools programme is just a grant scheme. Local authorities can devise funding and operational arrangements as they see fit to complement the grant element. Experience shows there is potential for private sector involvement in the provision and operation of local authority swimming pool facilities. Many local authorities are exploring various ways of involving the private sector in their projects. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism does not object to the involvement of the private sector, as long as the generally accepted operational considerations of a public pool form part of the project. The considerations involve, for example, non-membership pay per swim access, concessionary rates as part of social inclusion measures, etc.

There is overcapacity in the competitive chicken processing market. There is a trend towards consolidation into larger processing units. Further investment could not be contemplated because the plant was deemed to be small by industry standards. I understand that employees will be given an opportunity to take up alternative positions in Charleville, where a major expansion is taking place, and Listowel, where demand for workers is increasing. To get a replacement industry into the plant, it would need to be decommissioned and fumigated and to be made available as a vacant unit. Shannon Development, which is responsible for industrial development in the area, is ready and willing to explore and consider eligible business proposals from current employees or other parties. A small group has been established to represent the community's interest. Shannon Development and the local county enterprise board are working with the group on the future development of the area.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The implementation of regional development strategy is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies concerned and not one in which I am directly involved. However, in line with stated Government policy, Enterprise Ireland seeks to encourage a balanced spread of regional development. Enterprise Ireland's strategy in this regard includes encouraging companies, where relevant, to locate outside Dublin and its environs to less developed regions.One of the ways in which Enterprise Ireland facilitates client companies that wish to relocate to regional locations is by making it financially more attractive for them to establish or grow outside Dublin and the mid-east region. For example, Enterprise Ireland provides higher levels of funding assistance for companies that are expanding or establishing a business in the BMW region. In the BMW region, the grant aid rate for building competitiveness is 45% of eligible expenditure, while in the south-east, south-west and mid-west regions it is 30%. In the Dublin and mid-east regions, the rate is 25%.The availability of suitable building infrastructure can be an important factor in encouraging companies to expand outside Dublin. Enterprise Ireland makes its client companies aware of available business space in the regions and conducts itineraries to regional locations for companies who might be encouraged to relocate.In this regard, the institutes of technology are key players in Enterprise Ireland's regional development strategy. They are recognised as a vital component of the innovation system in each region. Since 2001, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of almost €25 million for 11 regionally based incubation units in the institutes of technology to encourage knowledge-based companies to locate therein.Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding of €24 million for the provision and operation of over 100 regionally based community enterprise centres. Community enterprise centres are regarded as key partners in the development of new enterprises and enterprise culture in the regions.Ultimately, the choice of location for new and expanding Irish businesses is influenced by many factors, including the promoter's home base, proximity to markets, availability of physical, educational and research infrastructure, access to raw materials and availability of skilled labour and research facilities, to name but a few. In light of Irish promoters' tendency to locate close to their roots, and taking account of all the other factors, Irish companies have shown themselves to be less mobile than their foreign counterparts both at start-up and expansion stages.In 2004, Lir Chocolates Limited moved from Dublin and relocated to Navan, County Meath, when moving to bigger premises. It is not possible for Enterprise Ireland to verify if the same employees moved with the company to its new location.

These have included the Department's review of the one-parent family payment, regarding which a report was published in October 2001, and participation in an international OECD study on reconciling work and family life, entitled Babies and Bosses, Volume II of which contains the findings on Ireland. The Department has also assisted in NESF studies on lone parents. Relevant research has been carried out under the Department's family research programme and by the Combat Poverty Agency, the ESRI and other bodies in this general area.In November 2004, following discussion at the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, it was decided that priority be given to specifically examining obstacles to employment for lone parents.The aforementioned OECD report shows that employment participation among lone parents in Ireland is relatively low compared to that in other OECD countries. Jobless households are particularly at risk of poverty and the fact that lone parents and their children are among the groups most at risk may, in part at least, be attributed to the relatively low level of employment participation. It was therefore concluded that action in this area would be a key element in the context of the special initiative on ending child poverty under Sustaining Progress.This task was entrusted to the senior officials' group on social inclusion, which reports to the Cabinet committee. The senior officials' group has set up a small steering group to examine the issue in detail and prepare a draft report for consideration by the group and, when completed, the Cabinet committee. Both the senior officials' group and steering committee are chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and the secretariat to the latter group is provided by the family affairs unit in my Department. The Department of Finance and the office for social inclusion in my Department are also represented on the steering group. Representatives of other Departments will participate as necessary.The steering group held its first meeting recently and will meet on a regular basis with a view to completing its draft report by mid-year. It is expected that the final report will be presented to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in the second half of the year.The report will contain an analysis of obstacles to employment for lone parents which may arise in current support arrangements, including income support, education and training, employment, health, housing and accommodation, with recommendations on how these obstacles could be overcome and what further supports may be required to facilitate lone parents in taking up employment, including information provision. Special account will be taken of the findings of a report that NESC has been commissioned to prepare, under Sustaining Progress, on the possible merging the child dependant allowance, CDA, with the family income supplement.A list of the members of the steering group on lone parents is given in Appendix A.Ms Mary DoyleDepartment of the Taoiseach (Chair)Ms Eileen KeoghDepartment of the TaoiseachMr. Michael ScanlonDepartment of FinanceMr. Dermot QuigleyDepartment of FinanceMr. Gerry ManganOffice for Social InclusionMs Orlaigh QuinnOffice for Social InclusionThe secretary to the group is Mr. Heber McMahon, Department of Social and Family Affairs.

The southern region of the Health Service Executive has advised that, having assessed his circumstances, the person concerned was awarded basic supplementary welfare allowance in December 2004 on the condition that it would be for a limited period to allow him a further opportunity to make reasonable efforts to secure employment.He failed to make reasonable efforts subsequently to seek employment and payment of his supplementary welfare allowance was terminated as a result at the end of January 2005. He was unsuccessful in appealing against this decision to the executive's area appeals officer and at his request his case has been referred to the social welfare appeals office for review.The executive has further advised that the wife of the person concerned is in part-time employment. She was absent from work through illness recently and received a reduced rate of disability benefit from my Department. In addition to this benefit she received assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to ensure that the overall household income was maintained at the supplementary welfare allowance level appropriate to the family circumstances.

According to figures received by my Department from the central applications facility the number of applicants for Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon is 69 and 280 respectively. These figures represent applications made through the central applications facility before the priority application date of 7 September 2004.The decentralisation implementation group report to the Minister for Finance of 19 November 2004 made recommendations on the locations and organisations to be included in the first phase of moves. In the case of my Department, Sligo was included in the first phase of moves and Carrick-on-Shannon was recommended as a potential location for an early move. The estimated date given in the report for the completion of building works in Sligo is the third quarter of 2006 and in Carrick-on-Shannon the second quarter of 2007.The Office of Public Works has been charged with securing suitable accommodation in the decentralised locations. It has confirmed to my Department that the planned extension to the pension services office in Sligo will accommodate staff relocating under the decentralisation programme. It is expected that the contractors will be on site by mid-year, with completion scheduled for early 2007.In the meantime, my Department has initiated plans, subject to the availability of suitable temporary accommodation, to relocate the supplementary welfare allowance section to Sligo this year. The Office of Public Works is in the process of identifying suitable accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon. Detailed plans, including timescales, will be completed once a site has been procured.

The qualifying period for third level courses of study was increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants from September 2004.This qualifying period is to be reduced from 15 months to 12 months from September 2005. However, the person concerned started his course of study in September 2004 when the qualifying period was 15 months and does not, therefore, satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme.

Under standard assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. In addition to this minimum contribution, each recipient is also required to contribute any assessable means he or she has over and above the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people who are engaged in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people to retain a portion of their rent supplement where they take up employment through approved schemes such as community employment, subject to a weekly household income limit of €317.43. In such cases, the supplement may be retained on a tapered basis over a period of up to four years. Participants in community employment have the option of being assessed for rent supplement purposes under either standard or special retention rules, depending on which option is more favourable in their situation.The Dublin-mid-Leinster office of the Health Service Executive was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the person concerned had been in receipt of rent supplement which was based on her income from one-parent family payment. It came to the attention of the executive that the person concerned is now participating in a community employment scheme. The level of her household income is now such that she does not qualify for rent supplement under either the tapered retention rules or standard assessment rules. Her rent supplement was terminated accordingly. The person has appealed against this decision to the executive's area appeals officer. The appeal will be decided as soon as possible.

Some of those who are eligible for a companion free travel pass include recipients of disability allowance or invalidity pension who are medically assessed as being unfit to travel unaccompanied; people who are blind or severely visually impaired; people who are confined to wheelchairs; people who are aged 75 years and over and who are medically certified as unfit to travel alone; and people who are receiving full-time care and attention from someone who is in receipt of a carer's allowance.The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. The purpose of the companion pass scheme is to ensure that a person's entitlement to free travel is not diminished because a companion cannot afford to accompany them. Any further extension to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.

Quadricycles and motorcycles, including micro-motorcycles, come within this definition.In order to use a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, a range of requirements must be satisfied in relation to both the vehicle and the driver. Specifically, a mechanically propelled vehicle when in use in a public place must comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996 and the driver must have third party insurance cover in accordance with section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. In addition, under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, a driving licence is required to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. The minimum age for holding a driving licence is 16 years for a moped and small motorcycles and 17 years for a quadricycle.Enforcement of the road traffic law is a matter for the Garda Síochána. The penalties for breaches of the road traffic law in respect of these requirements are a fine not exceeding €800 in the case of a first offence, a fine not exceeding €1,500 in the case of a second or subsequent offence, and a fine of €1,500 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months or both in the case of a third or subsequent offence in a period of 12 consecutive months. A person convicted of a breach of section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 incurs five penalty points.In addition to the requirements of road traffic law, a mechanically propelled vehicle for use in a public place is required to be registered and liable to motor tax, which are matters for the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, respectively.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	470	EU Directive 2000/56/EC provides for changes in the type of vehicle that may be presented for a driving test. These changes only apply in respect of truck, bus, or car with trailer driving tests. The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) Regulations 2004, SI 705 of 2004, give effect to the provisions of the directive. Vehicles registered before 1 January 2004 are not subject to these requirements and may continue to be used for driving test purposes until 2013.In February 2002, representative bodies of driving instructors were advised, by letter, of the directive. In the course of information sessions held at most test centres in both 2003 and 2004, regional supervisors from my Department advised driving instructors that changes were to be introduced to the representative vehicles that could be presented for driving tests. While the implementation date of 14 February 2005 for the change was decided in November 2004, I am satisfied that the correspondence and information sessions conducted during the previous three years provided adequate notice of the impending change.

The pass rate may be influenced by a number of factors, including the number of lessons taken by the candidate, the standard of instruction available and social and demographic factors. The work of driver testers is monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure consistent application of the test standard.

The aviation market in the EU is fully liberalised, and EU airlines are free to fly where they wish in the EU, subject only to the normal safety and technical requirements. Regarding transatlantic aviation, I am aware of the concerns set out in the report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism, dated 30 September 2003, regarding restrictions on aviation services between Ireland and the US.As I have indicated in the House on a number of occasions, my officials have been engaging in exploratory discussions with U.S. officials about possible changes to transatlantic arrangements.

However, US carriers may only operate charter services to and from Cork.Traditionally the focus of Irish transatlantic services had been on Shannon and Dublin. Recently, however, my Department took account of a number of Irish policy developments such as the Government's decision to separate the State airports to increase their regional focus, as well as the opportunities for extra tourism, and concluded, with my agreement, that no objection should be raised if any airline wishes to operate services between Cork and the USA. As I mentioned above, only Irish carriers may operate scheduled services to and from Cork.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	481	The Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the introduction and operation of the penalty points system, contains specific provisions governing application of such points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed on a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under section 5. This date is referred to in the Act as the "appropriate date".The provisions in the 2002 Act, in regard to the appropriate date, recognise that as a result of the endorsement of penalty points a person may face the application of an automatic disqualification from driving. Section 3 of the Act establishes that where a person accumulates at least 12 penalty points, he or she will be disqualified for a period of six months. If penalty points were to be applied from the date of the commission of the offence in the first instance, or from the date of the payment of the fixed charge, a person could be faced with the prospect that they would have already been disqualified in advance of any notification being sent to that effect. This would in turn create the situation that a person would be open to a charge of driving when disqualified where they had driven in the period between the commission of the original offence or the payment of the charge and the date of the notice.The penalty points system has been designed and structured to ensure that any person who is accused of the commission of a penalty point offence is afforded a significant time period to chose whether or not to allow the matter to proceed to court. Save in respect of eight of the 69 offences determined to be penalty point offences in the Act, the option of the payment of a fixed charge is afforded to the accused person. A person presented with a fixed charge notice is given a period of 56 days in which to make such a payment before the certainty of a court summons is applied. There is, therefore, a potentially significant period made available to a person to make a decision and all of the time lapses relating to the system that are established in the Act are set out in the fixed charge notice issued in respect of the alleged commission of the offence.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I outlined the current position in regard to a number of public transport and road measures in the Dublin area in my response on 15 February 2005 to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 94, 95, 123, 132, 157, 161, 171, 344, 354, 360. In response to Questions Nos. 98 and 110 of 15 February, I outlined my intention to bring a ten year transport investment framework to Government.The ten year transport investment framework will identify the investment and outline the measures that I believe are required in order to further develop all elements of national transport infrastructure, addressing existing bottlenecks and capacity constraints, enhancing quality, optimising the use of the network and making prudent advance provision for future economic growth. The framework will include my proposals for investment in roads and public transport within the greater Dublin area. It is not possible to outline the specifics of the draft plan pending its consideration by the Cabinet infrastructure committee and by the Cabinet itself.I assume the Deputy is referring to the concept of a Dublin outer orbital route. Both the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, 1999, and the DTO's platform for change, 2000, identified a possible need for a Dublin outer orbital route linking Drogheda-Navan-Naas. More recently the regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, 2004, also provide for the development of such a route in the medium to longer term on the basis that these centres would be strengthened by the provision of good links between them without having to pass through the Dublin city area. A 2001 strategic study commissioned by the NRA of a Dublin outer orbital route concluded that such a route had significant merit and is feasible on engineering and environmental grounds. As a high level strategic study of the concept, the 2001 report, apart from identifying a possible corridor for an outer orbital, did not consider route options, appropriate road type and costs. Detailed consideration of these and other issues including spatial planning, land use and environmental issues and the appropriate type and class of road to be provided will be the subject of further studies.I have asked the NRA to carry out these further studies and to consider the proposed route as part of future road infrastructure development plans taking account of the national spatial strategy, the regional planning guidelines and the planning and traffic implications of such a route for the greater Dublin region and neighbouring regions. The proposal will also be considered in the context of the ten year transport investment framework currently being prepared within my Department.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is forecast to grow from last year's level of more than 17 million passengers to 30 million by 2018. New infrastructure capacity and facilities, both airside and landside, will clearly be needed to cater for this growth, including further terminal capacity. The issue at this point is how best to provide that additional capacity to meet passenger growth.As the Deputy is aware, An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at the airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits. I recognise that an early decision is desirable in regard to this matter so that, regardless of how it is provided, adequate terminal capacity is in place at Dublin Airport when required to meet the growth in passenger traffic. I am in the process of finalising proposals that I will be bringing to Government very shortly. My objective in putting proposals to Government will be to ensure the provision and operation of terminal capacity on an efficient, cost effective basis.

The regulations specify a maximum of four headlights on a vehicle and do not limit the number of auxiliary lights that may be fitted. Under the regulations, all lamps that show a light to the front of a vehicle must either be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp or be fitted and constructed so that they will not dazzle or mislead other traffic when lit. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for direction indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of seven watts. The European Communities (Road Traffic) (Vehicle Type Approval) Regulations 1991, provide that a vehicle which complies with the provisions of the relevant European Union type approval directive will be regarded as complying with Ireland's road traffic regulations on the construction, equipment, lighting and use of vehicles.I have witnessed the position of excessive lights on the top of cabs of HGV's and have drawn to the attention of the Garda Síochána the regulations in this regard. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the Garda.

In the context of a 19% increase in the Estimates for 2005 for my Department, I anticipate progress across a range of measures this year, including the local and regional drugs task forces, the rural social scheme, and the community development programme.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	491	Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf which involves the disbursement of up to €60 million from the fund.Following an invitation to groups and organisations to make applications for funding, over 1,600 applications were received by ADM in 2004. I understand that 21 of the applications received were in respect of proposals in County Kildare. The process of assessing and making decisions on these applications is ongoing and nearing completion. In this regard, to date the board has approved 420 projects for funding totalling approximately €42 million. Ten of the projects approved, involving funding of approximately €1.5 million, are based in County Kildare.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	492	My Department has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces, the ten regional drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund. Funding of €31.5 million is available in my Department to support and develop drugs projects through these programmes in 2005.In addition, approximately €20 million in funding is being provided on an annual basis to mainstreamed LDTF and YPFSF drugs projects through other Departments and agencies.

However, given my Department's focus on communities, particularly those that are vulnerable or under threat, all applications for funding receive serious consideration.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 93 of 9 November 2004 in relation to rural housing.

Funding is being continued under existing programmes to bodies such as area partnership companies, Leader groups, community development projects etc.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	496	As I have stated previously, the RAPID programme is now operating on a number of different levels.Many small-scale proposals from RAPID areas are being dealt with more effectively at local level. To support this approach dedicated funding of €6 million is provided in 2005. These proposals are being co-funded by the relevant Department or local agency under a number of categories with broad levels of funding agreed at national level. I am currently in discussions with my colleagues regarding co-funding a number of measures for 2005 and I hope to make an announcement in the near future.As regards the larger projects from RAPID plans that have already been submitted to Departments, these will continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, Departments will now deal with a smaller number of projects and will therefore be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions.Work on improving integration and coordination of service delivery at local level will also continue, as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.Special provision was made by the Government for RAPID areas under the dormant accounts plan. Discussions are ongoing with Departments regarding prioritisation of other non-capital actions included in the AIT plans. Communities in the RAPID areas will benefit from the measures that I have outlined.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I understand that Greencore employed a consultancy firm. I have not seen the report of the firm nor was it discussed in my meetings with the company. Any inquiries about the report would be a matter for the company itself.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Having examined the relevant application, I am satisfied the person in question meets the criteria laid down for payment of the farmer-rate of forestry premium.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	500	In addition to informal third party observations sought by my Department with the named individual on 7 October 2004, the individual's spouse contacted the Department by telephone on the same day. The outcome of that contact was to confirm the reluctance of the individual concerned to the release by the Department of the information in question.Contact was also made by the Department with the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, which had earlier in 2004 sought and been given the relevant records/file relating to the application for forestry premium by the individual concerned. The purpose of this contact was to advise the tribunal that the Department had received a request under the Freedom of Information Acts for such records/file and to establish whether the tribunal would have a difficulty with their release. The tribunal indicated that it had no such difficulty. There was also communication with the requester for the purpose of apprising him of progress in processing his request.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	501	As agreed with the Deputy's office, a copy of the FOI central policy unit notice number 13, "Requests involving third parties — A step by step guide" was forwarded to him on 16 February 2005.

His entire quota amounted to 109,105 litres, of which 21,808 litres had been allocated from the national reserve under various measures. As allocations from the national reserve are not eligible for temporary leasing, the maximum which the producer is entitled to offer to the 2004-05 scheme is 87,297 litres. Accordingly, the permission granted related to this amount.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	504	As part of the suggested 2007-13 rural development framework, the European Commission has proposed new criteria for less favoured areas. These lay emphasis on soil and climatic conditions. In line with other member states, Ireland has highlighted the sensitivity of this issue. Ireland has also sought clarification as to the Commission's intentions.While some clarification on the proposed methodology for redefining disadvantaged areas has just been received from the EU Commission, that proposed methodology needs detailed assessment and further clarification before we can respond fully to it in the course of ongoing negotiations. I shall continue to stress the sensitivity of this issue for Ireland in the course of those negotiations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The person named applied for consideration of force majeure/exceptional circumstances on 5 February 2004.Following examination of the exceptional circumstances outlined, my Department decided that the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002 will be excluded from the calculation of the single payment entitlements for the person named and the entitlements will be based on the reference years 1997, 1998 and 1999. A statement of provisional entitlements reflecting this position issued to the person named on 1 February 2005.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The sheep flock belonging to the flock owner in question was depopulated as a result of scrapie prior to Christmas 2001. He has been paid compensation on the basis of an agreement reached with my Department. The terms of the agreement and the amount of compensation and income loss involved were clearly understood and accepted by all concerned at the time of depopulation.Flock owners depopulated under this first phase depopulation arrangements were not allowed to restock for a period of two years. They received compensation for the capital value of the sheep and for income loss for that period. In addition, those who restocked in the third year, including the person named, also received compensation for income loss for that year.The amounts paid to these producers for the capital value of the animals and for income loss for the period of three years were generous having regard to all the circumstances involved. I do not consider that payment of any additional amounts by way of restocking grants is justified in these cases.

Having examined the circumstances outlined and supporting documentation, the single payment unit advised the person named that his application did not satisfy the criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation EC No 1782/2003.An opportunity to appeal this decision to the independent single payment appeals committee was offered to the person named but has not been availed of to date.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The application for payment in this case was received in my Department on 10 January 2005 and is being processed in accordance with the targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The person named submitted an application for consideration in respect of the inheritance and new entrant measures of the single payment scheme.Following the initial examination of the papers submitted the person named was requested to furnish additional information. This information has now been received and both applications have been processed. The person named has been successful in respect of both the new entrant and inheritance measures of the scheme. However, the inheritance measure, which is the inherited entitlements combined with those earned by the person named in his own right, was more favourable financially than the new entrant measure.The person named was notified on the 18 February 2005 that the inheritance measure would be the one reflected in his statement of provisional entitlements scheduled to issue shortly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 400 of 15 February 2005.The working group which is considering the specification and guidance documents for earth-lined stores has reached an advanced stage in its work. Some further discussions are taking place this week. I expect that the expert working group will shortly submit its conclusions to my Department and to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Consideration will be given to the working group's recommendations particularly in the context of the implementation requirements of the nitrates directive.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	511	The person named was notified that his application for consideration of force majeure/exceptional circumstances as a result of BSE depopulation in 2001 was successful and that his single payment entitlements would therefore be based on the two-year average for 2000 and 2002.Following this decision the person named submitted an appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee. In the light of the circumstances outlined in the appeal, the single payment unit is satisfied that the force majeure circumstances had a greater impact on the pattern of production in 2002 and therefore the year 2002 rather than 2001 should be excluded and the two-year average of the years 2000 and 2001 only will be used in the calculation of the provisional single payment entitlements. A certificate of provisional entitlements reflecting this position will issue shortly to the person named.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	512	Allocations of milk quota from the milk quota national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.The named person has submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship in the current 2004-05 milk quota year. The tribunal examined this application at a recent meeting and an allocation of additional quota was recommended. This allocation has now been approved and notification is being issued to the person and his cooperative.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Payments of the 2005 forestry premium will be made in April of this year.

A full review of the circumstances of the case including this additional information will be carried out by the independent single payment appeals committee at its meeting scheduled for 23 February 2005 and the person named will be notified shortly of the outcome.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Unsuccessful appellants are advised of their right of recourse to the office of the Ombudsman. In addition, under the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001, the decision of an appeals officer may be reviewed by the Director of Agriculture Appeals, where the legality or factual basis of the decision is questioned.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Farmers will be required to indicate on their 2005 area aid-single payment application forms the date from which the ten months retention period for each of their parcels begins. Farmers will be allowed to choose at most two different dates in respect of their parcels and those two dates must be between 1 September 2004 and 30 April 2005.In choosing the starting date for a parcel a person will need to be mindful of declarations in respect of that parcel for 2004. In 2004 forage parcels had to be available and accessible for rearing animals for a seven months period commencing between 1 January 2004 and 31 March 2004. Care should be taken that there is no overlapping between the ending of the seven months period for 2004 and the beginning of the ten months period for 2005. In the case of parcels declared in 2004 for arable aid the ten months period for the 2005 single payment scheme should not commence until after harvesting of the 2004 crops. Also, in the case of rented or leased lands there should be no overlapping between the ending of a rental agreement or lease for 2004 and the commencement of the ten months period for 2005.It will not be possible, for the reasons outlined to automatically set 1 September 2004 as the start date for all parcels. Some farmers will, however, be free to commence afforestation after 1 July 2005 on parcels declared for the 2005 single payment scheme where they have indicated a valid start date of 1 September 2004.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The negotiations on the new WTO round are taking place under the mandate, known as the Doha Development Agenda, agreed at the WTO ministerial conference in Doha in November 2001. This mandate provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries will be an integral element of all aspects of the agriculture negotiations. Significant progress was made towards concluding a new round with the framework agreement agreed in Geneva in August 2004. The framework agreement recognises the critical importance of agriculture to the economic development of developing countries and the need to allow them to pursue agricultural policies that are supportive of their development goals, poverty reduction strategies, food security and livelihood concerns. The framework agreement sets out, in broad outline, the terms of special and differential treatment which will apply to developing countries in the form of longer implementation periods and less demanding commitments than will apply to developed countries. Negotiations on details are continuing with a view to reaching a conclusion at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. I fully support the approach to assisting developing countries outlined in the Doha Development Agenda and the framework agreement.

The Garda Commissioner has established an implementation group under the chairmanship of the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Peter Fitzgerald, to examine the issues arising from the recommendations contained in the first report of the Morris tribunal.A number of working groups have been established to deliberate on matters raised in the report. These working groups are examining the following areas; (1) role of assistant commissioner and accountability framework; (2) erosion of discipline; (3) issues involving personnel; (4) migration management and policy of tenure; (5) management development; (6) internal audit; (7) informant management; (8) religious and ethnic minorities.The working groups have almost completed their deliberations and the issues referred to will be addressed therein. A composite report, containing firm recommendations, will be prepared by the implementation group for the Garda Commissioner and myself.

The agreement also provides that legal aid granted in the member state in which the court is sitting shall cover the costs directly related to the cross-border nature of the dispute including translation costs. Accordingly, in the case of the person whose case the Deputy has referred to, once the applicant is granted legal aid by the relevant authority, the board's role is completed and all issues with regard to the ongoing provision of legal services is a matter for the authority which has granted legal aid.

There is and continues to be close co-operation between the two police services in this regard. Whenever available information so merits, and if appropriate, the Garda and PSNI authorities initiate a joint investigation or operation with the objective of seizing illicit drugs and apprehending traffickers.In September 2004 the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland launched the first ever joint threat assessment on cross-Border organised crime. The threat assessment covers a number of crime areas, including drugs. Following on from the launch of the joint threat assessment the two police forces are working closely together to further develop the strategic response to cross-Border organised crime.The Deputy will appreciate that demand reduction relating to cocaine use in Northern Ireland is not an issue into which the Garda authorities can have any practical input.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The governor of Mountjoy Prison has indicated a total of 26,071 visits to the prison in the year 2004. The vast majority of these visits were to prisoners and the remainder by persons such as solicitors, gardaí, Irish Prison Service headquarters staff, contractors, catering and delivery staff, addiction counsellors, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Samaritans. While the exact number of persons who visited the prison is not readily retrievable, it is estimated that, on average, three persons were present during each visit to a prisoner.I can also inform the Deputy that prison records show a total of 2,695 separate committals to Mountjoy Prison in 2004. This figure includes committals from the courts and transfers from other prisons. There were 1,429 prisoner releases from Mountjoy Prison in the same time period.In addition, figures indicate a total of 1,854 prisoner transfers out of Mountjoy Prison to other institutions during the year and 736 prisoner escorts to various hospitals for treatment in 2004.Finally, there were 2,836 prisoner transfers from Mountjoy Prison to court and 3,119 prisoners escorted from court to Mountjoy Prison during the year. Legislation is being drafted to allow certain pretrial hearings to be conducted with the accused remaining in prison but participating in the proceedings by a video-link between the prison and court. This will reduce the number of prisoners who have to be transferred to and from the courts.

Following this, on April 17 the Government decided to provide up to 20 places for offenders aged up to 16 years at St. Patrick's Institution. The contract was not tendered, but was negotiated with the contractor who submitted the lowest tender for a construction project at an adjacent site in Mountjoy Prison in December 2001 which was not proceeded with. This procedure was adopted due to the urgency of the project at that point in time and the fact that the Prison Service was advised by its professional consultants that the rates in the Mountjoy tender were competitive, represented value for money and were unlikely to be improved in a new tender competition. The contract was awarded to Rohcon Limited. The original tender was conducted by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Prison Service and a total of seven contractors competed in the process.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	528	If a person is not happy with the conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána, it is open to him or her to make a complaint to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. The Garda Síochána Complaints Board is currently the statutory body to investigate complaints by members of the public against the Garda. A complaint can be made by writing or by calling to its offices.A complaint can also be made at any Garda station, and it will be forwarded to the board for attention unless the person indicates in writing that he or she wishes it to be dealt with by the Garda Síochána itself. The Minister cannot pass on a complaint to the board on anyone's behalf as it is a condition of the relevant legislation that the person concerned must make the complaint in one of the ways described. The board is not empowered to deal with complaints not lodged within six months of the date of the incident.The board's offices are located at Block 1, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1, telephone No. 01-878 7526.I understand from the Garda authorities that procedures put in place in relation to the victims of crime — which are set out in the Garda Charter for Victims of Crime — provide that the Garda will inform victims, where a suspect is charged, of the time, date and location of the court hearing of the charges against the accused. Victims who are not satisfied with the investigation of their case or have inquiries, suggestions or feedback on any aspect of treatment of the victims of crime by any member of the Garda Síochána may contact the Victim Liaison Officer, Community Relations Section, Harcourt Square, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2. (01) 6663802 or their local superintendent.I can further inform the Deputy that provision for victims is made by a number of Government agencies as well as non-governmental organisations. The rights and entitlements of victims of crime in Ireland are set out in the Victims Charter, published by my Department in 1999, following extensive consultations with all relevant agencies including the courts, Garda Síochána, the Prison Service, the probation and welfare service, the State prosecution service and the Victim Support organisation. Victim Support provides support to victims of crime and their families through a network of volunteers nationwide. My Department has provided funding for its administrative and staff costs amounting to €5.3 million in the five years up to the end of 2004.The charter makes specific provision for particularly vulnerable victims such as victims of sexual offences, domestic violence, elderly victims with disabilities, and children. It also contains specific provisions on keeping victims informed of the outcome of their complaints, the progress of any criminal proceedings, and the outcome of these proceedings.It is my intention to arrange for a review of the provisions of the Victims Charter in the near future, in order to ensure its continuing relevance and effectiveness in providing for crime victims. As well as administrative and other provisions, the review will critically examine the deployment of resources to ensure that they continue to deliver maximum effectiveness as well as value for money.The review will also have regard to the EU framework decision of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, which sets out to harmonise the treatment of victims of crime across the EU, to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its commitments in that regard.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	532	The Children Act 2001 is a very complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science mainly in respect of juvenile offending, and the Department of Health and Children mainly in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.Three main areas of the Act for which I have responsibility remain to be brought into operation. These concern the age of criminal responsibility, community-based options, and the provision of children detention centres for 16 and 17 year old offenders.The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. This order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, brought into operation a wide range of provisions, including Part IV — diversion programmes, including the Garda restorative justice provisions, most of Part VI — treatment of child suspects in Garda stations, Part VII — Childrens Court, Part XII — child protection measures.Among the other provisions which were brought into operation on 1 May 2002 were the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children — section 113 of the Act, a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children — section 114 of the Act, and restriction on movement order.I signed the second commencement order under the Act on 29 July 2004. This order brought into operation the remaining restorative justice provisions. Restorative justice is a philosophical framework which considers the ways in which crime harms relationships in the context of the community. It is a way of dealing with victims and offenders by focusing on the settlement of conflicts arising from crime and resolving the underlying problems which cause it.The family conference which was placed on a statutory basis on 29 July 2004 is convened by the probation and welfare service and the convening of the conference is directed by the court where it considers that the preparation of an action plan would be desirable in an individual case.A pilot programme for the mentor — family support — order is due to commence shortly. Pilot programmes of parental supervision orders are also being developed and are expected to be introduced later this year.The following tabular statement outlines the sections of the Children Act 2001 which have not yet been fully commenced in so far as my Department is concerned.

The role bestowed on them under the section 50 tax scheme and the rationale for that role is consistent with that objective. Their participatory role in providing accommodation is not incongruous with their function of safeguarding and promoting the best interest of students. There are no plans to review this aspect of the scheme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in recognised primary schools are permissible provided it is made clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management. However their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.The school referred to by the Deputy has temporary recognition. All issues, including the matter of payment of fees, would be taken into account in the context of consideration being given to extending permanent recognition to the school.It should be noted that capitation funding has increased significantly in recent years from €57 per primary pupil in 1997 to €134 in 2005 and to €286 per pupil at second level.

My Department allocates additional teaching support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupils involved and having regard to a range of factors including the overall resources available to the school.An application for additional teaching support and special needs assistant support for a number of pupils, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy, was received in my Department on 21 June 2004. The school authority was notified of the outcome of this application on 24 September 2004. Subsequently an appeal was received in my Department on 12 October 2004 and the school authority was notified of the outcome of this appeal on the 1 November 2004.My Department has approved an allocation of 75.62 hours' teaching support per week and 45 hours' special needs assistant support per week to the school in question to cater for the special educational needs of a number of pupils, including the pupil to whom the Deputy refers. The level of support allocated was determined after detailed consideration of the school's application, the supporting documentation provided and having regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school to address special needs issues. If the school authority is of the view that the existing approved allocation is incapable of addressing the current level of assessed special needs within the school and additional information to that already submitted becomes available, my Department will be prepared to reconsider the case.

The National Council for Special Education has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.My Department has recently issued circular letter PPT 01/05 advising the authorities of post-primary schools of the arrangements put in place as a result of the transfer of these functions to the NCSE. I am confident that the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	547	In 1996-97, my Department's student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years' duration in other EU member states, including the UK. The courses must be followed in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. The extension of the schemes at that time did not extend to courses at postgraduate level. Students attending approved courses in other EU member states are subject to the same conditions of funding as students attending approved courses in the State. The main conditions of funding relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.Tax relief on tuition fees is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states. In recent years, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. These included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also. All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for consideration for grant assistance towards the tuition fee subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.The Deputy should note that significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break — Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class. In line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment, class sizes for the under-nines will continue to be reduced further.

It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Each project site must devise a collaborative programme of in-school and out-of-school actions, which provide after-school, holiday time, home, family and community supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from education. There are two school completion programme clusters serving schools in south-east Dublin. These clusters, comprising three post-primary and seven primary schools, have received an allocation in excess of €400,000 in 2004-05.My Department also provides funding for homework clubs in disadvantaged areas under the fund for the development of targeted responses to certain children at risk. This fund is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Its purpose is to develop preventative and supportive programmes targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. Under this fund, three projects are being supported in Dublin South East in 2005. These projects, including the Life Centre in Pearse Street and the Rathmines Information and Community Services Centre, have received combined funding in excess of €70,000 in 2004-05. It is a general requirement that projects supported under the above-named programmes spend their allocation within the relevant calendar or school year. In cases where a particular group does not exhaust its full allocation within the prescribed timeframe, this will be taken into account by my Department in determining the level of support required by the project in the following year. If the Deputy has any queries regarding particular projects, I will arrange for a direct response to issue if relevant details are forwarded to my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	550	There are different management and ownership structures for voluntary secondary schools, vocational schools, community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and primary schools. In general, voluntary secondary schools are privately owned and managed institutions, whereas all community and comprehensive schools are vested in the Minister for Education and Science. Vocational schools and community colleges are public schools owned and managed by vocational education committees who are responsible for the day-to-day running of these schools and colleges.The vast majority of denominational and multi-denominational primary schools are owned by the relevant patron. The sites and school buildings provided for Gaelscoileanna are vested in the Minister for Education and Science.Since 1999, the State offers to provide the full cost of sites for all new schools at both primary and second level. Where the State bears the cost of the site purchase new school buildings provided on these sites would be vested in the Minister and leased to the school operator.If the Deputy wishes to identify a particular school property I will arrange to have the ownership details made available to him.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Under present arrangements, the appointment requirement for mainstream class teachers in Gaelscoileanna operates to a lower ratio up to the appointment of 13 teachers, relative to other primary schools, including those located in the Gaeltacht.I am aware of the unique position of primary schools situated in Gaeltacht areas and of the particular problems that they experience as a result of losing teaching posts. In this context, since the start of the 1999-2000 school year, the staffing schedule for the retention of posts in Gaelscoileanna has applied to Gaeltacht schools.The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 107 pupils on 30 September 2003. The school also has a resource post and the services of two shared learning support posts.According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 110 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule which is expected to be notified to boards of management in the near future.As outlined in primary circular 19/02, an independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on the staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. Appeals in respect of staffing for the 2005-06 school year must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.

This application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria, which were revised following consultation with the education partners. Progress on this project is being considered in the context of the school building programme.In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that I recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects country wide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005. This announcement is the first in a series of announcements I plan to make in the coming period in relation to the schools building and modernisation programme that will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships; an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding; details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme; schools whose projects will further progress through the design process; and schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.

The review commenced in September 2004 and is continuing. The review is concerned with the level and deployment of SNA posts in mainstream classes. The intention is to ensure that the level of approved SNA support in schools, and the manner in which that support is being allocated, are such as to ensure that the special care needs of pupils are being appropriately met.Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in respect of applications made to my Department will be based on the outcome of this review. It is my intention that decisions will issue to the schools concerned at an early date.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The pupil in question is currently in receipt of 2.5 hours resource teaching support. My Department has received an application to increase this support to five hours per week. In addition, the school has made an application for 15 hours per week special needs assistant, SNA, support for the pupil.My Department advised the school on 9 November 2004 that the pupil's special education needs, SEN, appear to be within the high incidence category and he is therefore receiving the level of resource teaching support appropriate to his category of need. It would be expected that the pupil's SEN can be met from within the current resource-learning support teaching allocation available to the school. The school currently has the services of one shared learning support post together with 13 hours part-time resource teaching support. It is a matter for the school to deploy these resources to meet the SEN of the pupils in the school.The Deputy may be aware that a review of SNA provision in primary schools commenced in September 2004 and is continuing. The review is concerned with the level and deployment of SNA posts in mainstream classes. The intention is to ensure that the level of approved SNA support in schools, and the manner in which that support is being allocated, are such as to ensure that the special care needs of pupils are being appropriately met.Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support for the pupil in question will be based on the outcome of this review and a decision will issue to the school as quickly as possible.

Acquisition of the site is at an advanced conveyancing stage. The school referred to by the Deputy has not requested additional accommodation, however, a new school in this area is expected to commence operation next September and the planning section of my Department is currently liaising with the chairperson of the board of management with a view to procuring temporary accommodation to facilitate its commencement plans.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning and includes the provision of a physical education hall. I recently announced details of 122 major school building projects that will progress to tender and construction phase over the next 12 to 15 months under the €3.4 billion multi-annual funding secured for the years 2005-09. I am anxious to ensure that a consistent flow of projects to tender and construction can be sustained into the future. I plan to make a number of announcements in the near future in relation to the schools building and modernisation programme including details of those school projects which will further progress through the design process. All projects in architectural planning, including the school in question, will be considered as part of this process.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The higher education grants schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992.Under the higher education grants scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.An approved institution is defined to mean a university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.Each year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise public funded third level institutions. In this regard, the student referred to by the Deputy is not attending an approved college for the purpose of the scheme.Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme to include private colleges such as Griffith College can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges. Tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State, including Griffith College. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I am aware that County Kildare VEC has not been in a position to hold the first meeting of its newly re-constituted committee. I understand that the reason for the delay is due to the finalising of the appointment process by the local authorities of four members from among nominated representatives of community, voluntary and other interests as set out in the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001. It is expected that this appointment process will be completed shortly and that the first meeting of the new committee will take place in March next.The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 represents a new departure by giving a statutory right to parents and guardians to be represented on VECs for the first time. The election of parent representatives heralds a significant step in the partnership process whereby representatives of parents, VEC staff and other relevant community interests will sit alongside elected local authority members on VECs for the first time. The Act provides for a balance in representation of members between the different categories with two members to be elected by parents, two members to be elected by VEC staff and four members to be appointed from among the nominated representatives of community, commercial and other interests in addition to the elected local authority members. I am confident that the views of parents will now be adequately represented on the new committees and I have no proposals to change the position at this stage.

This board must be constituted in accordance with the existing model which does not, at this point in time, allow for parent or teacher representation. This board, however, will be replaced by a board that will include such representation following the finalisation of revised arrangements for the composition of boards of management across the comprehensive sector. Agreement on these arrangements is nearing conclusion with the relevant education partners.The parties involved in the Ballymun comprehensive school have been informed of the position.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that tenders in excess of €9 million have been accepted for a major refurbishment and extension programme at Ballymun comprehensive schools to enable the planned amalgamation take place. The contractor went on site on 24 January last and I am confident that the amalgamation will proceed, as intended, on 1 September 2005.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	561	On the basis of the information supplied by Bus Éireann in its report of 10 November 2003, only two families are eligible for transport to the school referred to in the details supplied. These families have a pick-up point 0.3 and 0.8 miles from their homes. This is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.The seven children of the remaining four families are not eligible for school transport to the school referred to in the details. These children may avail of concessionary transport to that school subject to no additional State costs being incurred by way of extending or altering the route of the existing service.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	562	Having confirmed the identities of the pupils in question with the Deputy's office, I wish to confirm that my Department considered applications for resource teaching support for both pupils. The school was advised on 4 February 2005 that the pupils do not qualify for resource teaching support as the applications did not meet the criteria for such support. The school currently has the services of a learning support teacher post and a resource teacher post supporting a total enrolment of 28 pupils. It would be expected that the special educational needs of both pupils can be met from within these resources. I understand that the assessments were carried out by a person who was a former member of my Department's staff.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	563	Personal assistants are utilised within third level colleges for certain classes of students with disabilities, mainly those with physical or mobility difficulties. The main source of funding for personal assistants is the fund for students with disabilities. Colleges of further and higher education can apply on behalf of students who require a personal assistant in order to participate equitably in their education. Contractual arrangements in relation to personal assistants vary between institutions. Most colleges either use agencies that supply personal assistants, or employ personal assistants directly on temporary part-time or wholetime contracts. In both cases, the employer of the personal assistant is required to comply with the relevant employment legislation which is in force at this time. In some smaller colleges, personal assistants are contracted on a self-employed basis directly by the student, who is provided with the necessary resources by their college.The manner in which the personal assistants are employed is a matter for each institution. The terms and conditions of employment for employees who provide support for students with disabilities in third level is a matter for the individual colleges concerned.

This competition will be advertised as soon as possible.As regards the matter of former members of the Defence Forces making application to the Defence Forces ombudsman, on his-her appointment, the position is that the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 generally provides that both serving and former members of the Defence Forces may make an application within 12 months of the occurrence of an action complained of or within 12 months of the applicant having become aware of the action complained of. However, members and former members of the Defence Forces will not be able to make application to the Defence Forces ombudsman in regard to a matter which pre-dates the commencement of the legislation. Complaints made by serving members of the Defence Forces relating to matters pre-dating the commencement of the legislation may be submitted to the Minister through the structured redress of wrongs process, as at present, on a transitional basis when the new legislation is commenced.

The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category. My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, with regard to the re-housing of those overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing. The Department remains in contact with the overholders pending resolution of the issue.

A contract of sale and deed of transfer have been executed in respect of another case. Two further houses are in the process of being sold by tender and it is expected that these sales will also be completed in 2005. The sales of the remaining 12 quarters to the occupants are being actively pursued.

My Department has also established that no application for funding has been made to Kildare County Council under the grants scheme for the conservation of protected structures which is administered by local authorities, although the council is aware of the project.Applications for grant assistance in 2005 under either of these schemes are now closed. It will be open to the project promoters to lodge an application for assistance under the 2006 schemes.

My Department has no function in the matter. However, the issue of waste charges and low income persons-households has been raised in a social partnership context arising from Sustaining Progress. Discussions are continuing between my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in terms of identifying how any outstanding issues might be addressed.

The share of social housing has increased by approximately 30% since 2000. This reflects successful policies to encourage an increase in overall housing supply together with a commitment to increasing the rate for building of social houses.Number of House CompletionsNumbers of Newly Built Social HousesPercentage Social Housing %200049,8123,1556.3200152,6024,8759.3200257,6955,76310.0200368,8196,1338.92004 (9 months)54,1703,1235.7These figures do not reflect the total provision of social housing as they do not include the number of acquisitions of housing units for social rented accommodation or the casual vacancies in social housing stock that occur each year. It is expected that the accommodation needs of more than 13,000 households will have been addressed in 2004 through the various social and affordable housing measures.A definitive breakdown of house completions either by type of purchaser or whether they were second, holiday or investment homes cannot be provided at present. My Department is in discussion with the Central Statistics Office regarding the collection of more reliable information on second homes with the objective of addressing this information deficit.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I refer to the reply to Question No. 346 of 1 February 2005. Work is continuing in my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, to prepare a response to the European Commission letter of formal notice — Article 228 — in regard to Ireland's nitrates action programme.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Under the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by the Health Service Executive, formerly the health boards, in line with various guidelines issued from time to time by the task force which administers the scheme under the aegis of my Department, aid is provided to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or insanitary conditions. The household may include more than one elderly person. Aid is not available where others who are not elderly are resident in the house. Decisions to grant assistance in individual cases are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive at local level and it is a matter for the relevant community care department to determine, within the funds available, the priority of cases on hand.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	575	Information on the number of houses completed and started by Laois County Council for each of the years 2000 to 2004 under the local authority housing construction-acquisition programme is set out in the following table.YearCompletionsStarts2000681122001128163200263108200357682004 end September14968Completions-acquisitions figures for the full year 2004 are being finalised and will be published in due course in the annual housing statistics bulletin. The delivery of housing by local authorities in the next few years is being developed in the context of new five year action plans for social and affordable housing to ensure a systematic and integrated approach to the effective use of resources. I consider that given the nature of continuous housing need, the preparation of these action plans is beneficial to local authorities in identifying priority needs over the coming years and providing a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including delivery of housing by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. The majority of these plans, including Laois County Council's action plan, have already been approved by my Department and the remainder are likely to be approved within a matter of weeks. Laois Country Council's nominated housing programme for 2005 has recently been received and is under examination in my Department.

The Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for devising and implementing such flood relief measures. No funds are available to the Department specifically to meet expenditure incurred by local authorities due to flooding. However, local authorities can, where necessary, provide emergency short-term accommodation for persons made homeless as a result of disasters such as flooding. My Department recoups 90% of the cost of providing such accommodation.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	583	My Department has on a number of occasions prior to 2002 identified specific communication requirements which could not be met by the resources available in the Department. On some of those occasions, the shortfall was met by contracting specialist communications expertise.In 2000, my Department awarded a contract for assistance in devising and implementing the national spatial strategy, NSS, communications campaign. Included in that campaign were a range of marketing and advertising initiatives, to promote awareness and interest in the NSS, to disseminate information, identify and engage the target audience for the consultation process and support that process through organising consultation forums at regional level at various stages during the strategy's preparation.In 1998, my Department awarded a contract for assistance with advertising campaigns in connection with the draft register of electors and the referendums on the Good Friday Agreement and the Treaty of Amsterdam. For a number of years prior to 2002, specialist assistance was contracted for anti-litter awareness campaigns. A non-established temporary civil servant acted as communications co-ordinator to my Department for the period from October 1999 to June 2002.

It is a matter for the elected members of Bray Town Council to adopt the final plan in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.The question of zoning land for different uses is a matter for each planning authority to address in the context of its development plan. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding. Development plan objectives may also include policies indicating that developers will be required to support the funding of flood defences needed for particular developments, either partially or fully, depending on the circumstances involved.The Office of Public Works, as a prescribed consultee on all draft development plans under the Planning and Development Act 2000, has the opportunity as appropriate to ensure that its views are considered in the making of development plans with particular reference to its statutory responsibilities in respect of river drainage, flood relief and localised flooding problems. I refer also to the reply to Question No. 72 of 9 February 2005.

The additional information sought from Donegal County Council has recently been received and the application is being further considered by my Department. The council will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 provide that development which consists of a change of use within any one of the certain specified classes of use is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to certain conditions. One of these classes of use is as a shop. The definition of "shop" in the regulations specifically excludes use for the sale of hot food for consumption off the premises except where the sale of such food is subsidiary to the main retail use.I am considering whether it may be desirable to amend the regulations so that a change of use from a shop to an off-licence would require planning permission. Any such change would require positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	587	The Irish housing stock was approximately 390 per 1,000 persons at the end of 2003. While we are moving closer to the EU 15 average of 440, such comparisons must take account of differences resulting from demographic, economic and cultural factors. The Government has not, therefore, set a housing target per head of population. The focus of policy is on seeking to ensure that supply meets prospective needs.We are building houses at a rate of over 19 units per 1,000 persons. This is the highest rate of house building in the European Union. More than 30% of the entire Irish housing stock has been built over the past seven years. The regional planning guidelines, which have been adopted in each region, incorporate estimates of the population and household distribution in the region in the period up to 2020. These guidelines provide a strategic, long-term context for local authority development plans, particularly in terms of providing through the development plan process adequate zoned lands to meet future demands for residential development.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Government is giving careful consideration to this report, as well as report No. 112 of the National Economic and Social Council, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, and a report by Goodbody Economic Consultants, within the context of its continuing commitment to meeting the broad range of housing needs. I intend bringing proposals to Government in response to these reports as soon as possible.

SEI comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

The group comprises representatives of a cross section of relevant bodies which have an interest or expertise in the matter. The terms of reference of the group are "to examine the current position regarding management of kennels and to make recommendations for such improvements, including better regulation, as it considers necessary in this area".Its work programme is a matter for the group itself. As part of its examination of the issues, I understood the group undertook public consultation and has held three meetings to date. I expect to receive a report by the end of March.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	593	Under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, all relevant local authorities adopted Traveller accommodation programmes. The first programmes, covering the period 2000 to 2004, have just been completed. A second round of programmes, covering the period 2005 to 2008, is in the process of being adopted.The provision, under these programmes of new Traveller-specific accommodation and the refurbishment of existing Traveller-specific accommodation which includes halting sites and group houses is funded under my Department's Traveller accommodation capital programme. In the period 2000 to 2004, local authorities received an allocation of €125.69 million, of which €40 million was allocated in 2004. This does not include the cost of standard local authority accommodation provided for Travellers which is funded under my Department's local authority housing programme, or housing provided by voluntary housing bodies allocated to Travellers and funded under my Department's voluntary housing schemes.As section 214 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 transferred functions of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to the determination of compulsory purchase orders to An Bord Pleanála with effect from 1 January 2001, I have no function in authorising such orders.Local authorities develop particular Traveller-specific accommodation schemes in accordance with their Traveller accommodation programmes. Prior to commencing such schemes, local authorities must obtain approval from my Department, which allocates funding from within the overall Traveller-specific allocation to such schemes. My Department will continue to provide the necessary funding to meet the cost to local authorities of the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation.Details of the amount available to authorities for the provision and refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation will be made available in the revised Estimates for public service for 2005.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Government's targets in regard to social housing are not set on the basis of a social housing stock per population. Quantifying targets in this manner would not be appropriate given the influence of demographic and economic factors on the level of need at any point in time. The focus of the Government's housing programmes is on responding to identified needs. A broad range of targeted initiatives have been introduced in recent years to address the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs.The Government has responded to increased levels of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly in recent years and is committed to maintaining strong programmes into the future. Additional resources are being made available this year to increase the output of social housing further. As a result, we expect that approximately 5,500 new houses will be started under the main local authority programme and that the output of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector will also increase.In total, my Department will spend a record €1.3 billion in Exchequer funding on supports for social and affordable housing programmes in 2005. This will enable the needs of more than 13,000 households to be met this year through existing schemes and the new rent accommodation scheme will address the long-term housing needs of some 5,000 recipients of rent supplement.The decision to introduce five-year multi-annual capital investment programmes provides an important opportunity to ensure a structured basis for the planning and delivery of all social and affordable housing programmes. The statutory assessment of social housing which must be undertaken at the end of March this year will provide an up-to-date assessment of social housing needs.To maximise the benefits of this multi-annual approach, five-year action plans for social and affordable housing have been developed by local authorities. The main objective in developing these action plans is the need to ensure that the investment available for these programmes achieves the desired effect in the long term by tackling real need and breaking cycles of disadvantage and dependency having regard to the funding available under the five-year multi-annual capital envelopes.The expanded social and affordable housing provision over recent years has had a beneficial impact on the social rented housing stock. Returns from local authorities indicate that the number of occupied local authority dwellings has increased in recent years. The number of occupied local authority dwellings at the end of 2003 was in the order of 107,000, compared with 99,200 at the end of 1998.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	597	My Department has not reduced the grant to the project referred to in the question. While the level of accommodation-related funding applicable to this type of project is, in the first instance, a matter for decision by the local authority in whose area the project is situated, my Department recoups to the authority 90% of such funding. In this context, Kilkenny County Council has been requested to submit detailed information to support its proposal to increase the funding for the project in question. On receipt of this information, the matter will be considered further.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 66 and 134 of 9 February 2005, which set out the various grant schemes and other measures that are in place to support the protection of architectural heritage. I am satisfied these arrangements afford appropriate support for the safeguarding of our architectural heritage.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	599	On 23 January 2003, the European Commission issued Ireland with a reasoned opinion to the effect that the €20 fee for the making of a submission on a planning application which requires an environmental impact assessment is contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment. A reply issued to the European Commission on 16 May 2003 responding to each of the points raised in the reasoned opinion and setting out our contention that the imposition of a €20 participation fee is not in conflict with the provisions of the directive.On 22 July 2003, the European Commission issued a press release in which it stated its intention to refer the case to the European Court of Justice. No official communication has been received from the Commission to date. My Department has no plans to amend the relevant regulations which reflect an approach endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.
