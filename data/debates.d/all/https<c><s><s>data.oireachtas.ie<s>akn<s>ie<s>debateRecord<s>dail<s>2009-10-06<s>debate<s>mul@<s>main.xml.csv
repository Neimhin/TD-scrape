#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.Although sensitive information belonging to members of the public is not generally collected by or stored in the Department's electronic systems, specific measures are in place in my Department to protect all data held electronically.Access to personal information held on databases within my Department is controlled by application security and confined to relevant authorised personnel only.  Access by users to these systems is granted on an "as needs only" basis.  The Department's computer networks are secured against cyber attacks through the use of security products such as multiple firewalls, anti-virus software and e-mail security tools.  Remote access equipment is only issued to staff who have a business need to access the Department's systems out of the office.  All applications for access are sent to, and approved by, the personnel officer.  Staff supplied with mobile equipment are issued with guidance to ensure devices are secured properly.  The hard drives of all laptops are encrypted and do not store departmental data physically on them.  Strong authentication methods, in addition to user name and password, are in place to prevent unauthorised access to the Department's network from mobile devices.My Department complies with the guidelines on protecting the confidentiality of personal data issued by the Department of Finance.  It also evaluates and reviews advanced information security products and technologies as they come to market and implements them where appropriate.  In short, my Department applies best practice and uses industry standard information security protection devices and software to protect all data within its systems.  It regularly reviews and updates these security procedures and products as a matter of course.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's reply and we need more than firewalls around here.  In any event, in 2008 the personal data of 580,000 people was lost and the reporting of all of that was less than adequate.  To date, in 2009, Bord Gáis has lost the personal information of 75,000 customers and the HSE had 15 laptops stolen, two of which were not encrypted.  The Taoiseach is aware that in April 2007 the personal information of 380,000 social welfare recipients went missing.  It took 16 months, until August 2008, before the Minister for Social and Family Affairs was made aware of the extent of the losses.  Furthermore, the data was only password protected and did not have any encryption in place.The Taoiseach will also be aware that 16 laptops have been stolen from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office since 1999.  Laptops were stolen from the Bank of Ireland, computer disks were lost in New York by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, 15 HSE laptops were stolen in Roscommon and, as I said, Bord Gáis lost information on 75,000 customers.As I understand it, there is no specific legal obligation on a body that loses personal information to notify the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  That irritation was perfectly evident recently when that office only heard about the missing HSE laptops on the radio.  There have been many high profile thefts, whether such data was being targeted deliberately or stolen by accident.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that all the electronic data being held in his Department is encrypted and therefore of no use to people who have access to computers or hand-held technology?  Can he say why the Data Protection Commissioner was not informed of the theft of the HSE laptops?If Fine Gael were to introduce its Data Protection (Disclosure) (Amendment) Bill 2008, would the Taoiseach support it?  That would create a legal obligation on organisations to disclose within a certain period any breaches of data security.  Such an obligation would create very strong incentives for all organisations to ensure their data protection procedures were adequate in order to avoid any negative publicity that might ensue from having to disclose a breach of customers' sensitive and personal data.  If we introduce that Bill will the Taoiseach support it, and will he say why the Data Protection Commissioner was not informed about the missing HSE laptops?  Is he happy that all computer information, where personal data is stored with his Department, is at a minimum encrypted?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	2	This question applies to procedures within my Department, so I am not in a position to comment as regards other matters.  Such questions are best put to the line Ministers concerned as regards specific queries the Deputy may have.In terms of my Department, in the body of my reply I indicated that the hard drives of all laptops are encrypted and the departmental data is not physically stored on them.  There are strong authentication methods in place to prevent unauthorised access to the network from mobile devices.  I am satisfied on the basis of the information provided to me by the personnel office and the people in the Department responsible for this area, that best practice is being applied and that standard information security protection devices and software are being used to protect all data within the systems.In that respect it is fair to say that a small amount of computer equipment was reported to be lost or stolen.  Nine devices were reported lost or stolen since 2002, three of which were subsequently recovered.  There was no personal data on any of the devices concerned and the procedures for dealing with equipment reported lost or stolen were enacted in regard to these situations.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Arising from that, the Data Protection Commissioner's findings are only made public if the body being investigated actually requests it or agrees to it.  For example, the Irish Blood Transfusion Board appears to have agreed to it but the Bank of Ireland does not appear to have agreed to it.  Does the Taoiseach agree that in cases where an investigation is carried out by the Data Protection Commissioner concerning significant loss of personal or sensitive information, the findings should be made public, which is not always the case at present?  Obviously, the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner would be helpful to all organisations and set a standard that everybody would want to adhere to.  Does the Taoiseach agree there should not be this situation where the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner are made public only in circumstances where the organisation agrees or requests it?  Should it not be the case that they are made public in all circumstances to help everybody else set a standard and so that items of personal and sensitive information on computer disk are not lost?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The availability of information as a general principle is obviously something of which one would be in favour.  However, other considerations are sometimes in play, such as the confidentiality of personal information, and the information may not be regarded by the individuals concerned or affected as a matter that should come into the public domain in any event.  There are, therefore, various considerations which must be applied in regard to data protection.  For my part, any proposals that come from any part of the House on these issues will be considered constructively in line with the established principles of what is best practice in this area.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	5	In recent years, more than 110 laptops and similar devices have been stolen from different Departments.  Various e-Government projects have been spearheaded by the Department of the Taoiseach.  One of the obvious consequences of e-Government is that the State inevitably accumulates vast amounts of information about the personal details of people's lives, whether that be health information, information relating to farms and farmers, or otherwise.  If one is having a smart economy drive and an e-Government drive, it is inevitable that the Government ends up holding vast amounts of data about different aspects of people's lives.I want to restate the question.  First, devices which store data may be stolen or lost, perhaps because officials have them in their cars or take them home with them, or because the offices where the devices are held are broken into.  The general public wants to know what provision is in place for a type of rapid warning system which all Government agencies and Departments would sign up to in order to alert people to the fact that what to them may be sensitive information has been lost or compromised in some way.  Second, given that the Department of the Taoiseach has over the past ten years led the information, smart economy and e-Government project, would the Taoiseach not agree it is a matter for his Department to set standards and responses in regard to the observations from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner concerning the security of devices, particularly concerning the issue of informing people whose data and personal information may have been compromised in one way or another?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	6	With regard to what happens if a device is missing or stolen, in that event, the user account associated with that device is immediately disabled and, in the case of BlackBerries, they are centrally disabled from the server and the memory of the machine is also wiped in this procedure; the network provider is notified so that the SIM card is disabled, which renders the device inaccessible to unauthorised users; the Department's asset register is updated; in the case of theft, the user is asked to report the matter to the Garda; and, where personal or sensitive data are compromised, the Data Protection Commissioner will be also informed.On whether I am satisfied that personal data belonging to members of the public held in the Department's databases are safe from unauthorised access or from hackers, I am satisfied that my Department applies best practice on data protection.  The procedures, products and devices they have are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they are capable of providing the best security appropriate to the Department's needs at all times.  On whether there were any instances where personal data held by the Department or any of its agencies were compromised in any way, I am informed that no personal data held electronically by my Department have been compromised in any way.Regarding the need to comply with data protection legislation in the protection of personal data, I am informed that the Department fully complies with the provisions of the 1988 and 2003 Acts, and the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 in managing electronic and paper based records.On the overall situation in terms of data held electronically in all Departments, when I was Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance, as the Department of the public service, wrote to all Departments, offices, and agencies in November 2007 seeking information on the systems and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of personal data.  After collating and examining those responses the Department of Finance then produced a report for Government which contained the findings and a number of recommendations.  It was circulated to relevant stakeholders for comment and observation and was presented to Government for consideration in April 2008.  The Government noted the report and also that the Department of Finance was convening a working group to produce guidelines based on the recommendations of that report.  That cross-departmental working group had its first meeting in May 2008.  The CMOD section of the Department of Finance chairs meetings of the group and provides a secretariat.The group has produced guidelines and a template code of practice for Departments, offices and agencies on the protection of personal data held electronically, on paper and on data storage devices.  Those guidelines also cover the protection of data while being transferred electronically between Departments and via e-mail.  Those documents, based on best practice in this area were passed to the Data Protection Commissioner and other members of the working group for observations.  Following their responses both documents were circulated to all Departments, offices and agencies.  There has been an effort to provide uniform standards through that process in the past 12 to 18 months.

Does that function arise and is it the Taoiseach's Department that would carry out same?On a more general point about data protection but in an area for which the Taoiseach is directly responsible, namely, social partnership, has progress been made on the commitment in the Towards 2016 agreement that legislation would be enacted so that employment agencies shall in their dealings with jobseekers abide by all employee protection and data protection legislation in force in the State?  Will the Taoiseach give an indication, as it is directly under the aegis of his Department, on what progress there has been in moving towards such an assurance, a guarantee?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I indicated in a previous reply to a supplementary questions from Deputy Burton that the Department of Finance is the Department of the public service and when I was Minister for Finance I undertook a process of co-ordination to ensure best practice in this area across all Departments, agencies and offices.  In my detailed reply to a previous supplementary I indicated that that process was extensive, comprehensive and is now complete.  That answers that question.The other question about what progress has been made to date on employment agencies and commitments in Towards 2016 would be best tabled for a specific answer to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	As social partnership is an area under the direct responsibility of the Taoiseach's Department I would have thought he would have an oversight on not only the proposal but the agreement within Towards 2016.  Can he not give us something more than just a referral to another Department?  Has any progress been made, to the Taoiseach's knowledge, in bringing about the commitment in Towards 2016 in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	With respect, the question put down relates to the procedures in place in my Department for the protection of personal data held by electronic means.  The supplementary question is far wider in scope than could have been contemplated.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I propose to takes Questions Nos. 4 to 16, inclusive, and 169 together.The Cabinet committee on economic renewal last met on 27 July 2009.  The date of its next meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, 7 October.  Membership of the Cabinet committee on economic renewal, which I chair, includes the Tánaiste, Minister for Finance, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Minister for Health and Children, with other Ministers attending as appropriate.  As I indicated to the House in February, the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, PPPs, and its supporting cross-departmental team, have now been subsumed within these arrangements.The Cabinet committee on social inclusion, children and integration has met four times since June 2007.  The Cabinet committee on health has met on 15 occasions since June 2007.  The next meeting of the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security is scheduled to take place tomorrow, 7 October 2009, with further meetings as required during the remainder of 2009.To further develop policies in the area of climate change an informal expert advisory panel on climate change and energy security has been established with international and national experts to advise the Cabinet committee on the potential for, and cost of, greenhouse gas reductions in the non-ETS sector.  A list of members of the informal expert advisory panel established by the Cabinet committee is being circulated with this reply.  I support the idea of close co-operation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security in the run-up to the Copenhagen summit in December and I have written to the Chairman of the committee suggesting that the best means of achieving this be considered by the relevant officials.In conclusion, I emphasise that Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process.  Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government.  The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.Membership of the Informal Expert Advisory Committee on Climate Change:Professor Stefan Proost, Faculty of Business and Economics (FBE), Department of Economics, K.U. Leuven;Professor Alan Matthews, Professor of European Agricultural Policy in the Department of Economics, School of Social Sciences and Philosophy, Trinity College Dublin;Professor Frank Convery, Professor of Environmental Studies, College of Human Sciences, School of Geography, Planning & Environmental Policy, University College Dublin and Chairman of Comhar;Professor Thomas Sterner, Professor of Environmental Economics, Gothenburg;Jack Short, Secretary General, International Transport Forum;Paul Watkiss, Independent consultant specialising in environmental and economic policy advice;Brendan Walsh, Professor Emeritus of Economics in University College Dublin;Professor Peter Clinch, Special Adviser to the Taoiseach
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Last December, the Government published Ireland's framework for sustainable economic renewal, which set out a series of actions for the development of what was called a "smart economy".  The document was a revival and rehash of many different programmes that were already in existence.  Of the 125 action points contained in the summary, only one action plan could be described as new, and it referred to a €500 million innovation fund.  What is the status of that €500 million euro fund now?  Is the money in place?  How much of it is left?  Will the Taoiseach identify what elements of innovation have been funded through the innovation fund referred to in the action plan?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The factual position I have to outline here relates to the questions.  With regard to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the question of supporting innovation is fundamental to improving competitiveness in the economy.  A great deal of support has been given to that area, in the hundreds of millions of euro, through a wide range of research and development programmes.  The question of setting up specific funds around existing funds or using them in addition to existing funds would be a matter for budgetary consideration.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Is the Taoiseach saying the committee dealing with sustainable economic renewal discussed this action plan?  The sum of €500 million is a great deal of money.  The Taoiseach referred to assistance for innovation and science related activities and so forth.  That is welcome but was the €500 million referred to in the 125 action points in addition to what was in place previously?  Does he have an account of what it has been spent on or what elements of it have been spent and, if so, on what they have been spent? Can we identify a report on progress made in dealing with the €500 million innovation fund?In respect of the committee on sustainable economic renewal, the Minister for Finance, in his budget speech in April, stated:There is scope to access significant private funds for infrastructure projects in order to sustain as many construction jobs and as much activity as possible . . . This would support existing PPP projects and other projects previously funded by the Exchequer.What is the status of the Minister's proposal in this regard?  Is an activity report available on what has happened arising from his proposal?  Is the Taoiseach able to identify the major capital projects discussed at the economic recovery committee arising from the Minister's comments in April last?  Have specific projects been attracted under the public-private partnership system arising from the Minister's comments?In respect of the European Union, most Members of the House are very happy with the decision taken by the majority of the electorate when it voted last Friday.  The European Union has established an €8 billion stimulus package for major projects.  Has the economic recovery committee examined this package and is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the number or kinds of applications, if any, that have been made to the European Union in respect of drawing down some of these funds, which have been made available across the Union, for Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	As the Deputy is aware, it is not possible for me to discuss with him, in the context of replies at Question Time, what goes on at Cabinet committees or during Cabinet meetings.  I can only do so in respect of decisions when they are taken.  I am not, therefore, in a position to indicate to the Deputy progress made in any discussions in areas which are protected by Cabinet confidentiality.On matters generally, the Minister for Finance has been emphasising the need for value for money in the capital budget.  Great value for money is now available because of the more competitive pricing that is in play.  I understand an average improvement in pricing of 20% has been achieved.There has been a wide range of continuing significant capital commitments during this year.  Despite the difficult fiscal position, the Government is spending more than €7 billion on public capital programmes and a capital programme will also feature next year.  The important aspect of the programme is the ability to improve and increase output from resources that are not as plentiful as they were.  This is a big plus in terms of ensuring that the absolute maximum of employment is achieved in respect of the implementation of the programme.Similarly, in respect of European Investment Bank funds and other supports, continuing access is being made, where appropriate, from various Departments.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	If I understood the Taoiseach correctly, the committee on economic renewal is due to meet tomorrow.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The next meeting will be tomorrow.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The committee last met on 9 July.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It met on 27 July.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	20	In other words, what is arguably the most important committee has had nearly three months holidays at a time of massive unemployment, the collapse of the banking system and the publication of the Commission on Taxation and McCarthy reports.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Cabinet has been meeting every week.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I understand the committee on economic renewal is supposed to be a key operator in terms of the cross-cutting, interdepartmental Cabinet committees.  Given the economic crisis and weight of the budgetary and banking matters that must be addressed, does the Taoiseach believe it is appropriate to hold a meeting every two and a half months or have a two and a half month summer break?  The last time the Taoiseach answered questions on the committee on economic renewal, it did not appear that this committee had any function in the banking crisis.  Does it have a function in the banking crisis?  When it meets, will it have referred to it, the fact that JP Morgan has indicated that Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland will need capitalisation of €17 billion and Anglo Irish Bank, which is a dead bank, will need a further €6 billion?  Is the banking issue discussed by this committee when it meets?  In regard to the budgetary situation, will the committee have an opportunity to discuss the McCarthy report and, particularly, the Commission on Taxation report?  Is that parked, as the Taoiseach indicated in remarks he made a couple of weeks ago?In regard to the counterpart committee——
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I have to remind Deputy Burton that these questions, statistical or otherwise, could undermine Cabinet confidentiality.  I have to remind the Deputy of that.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I am very sorry to take issue with the Ceann Comhairle on anything, but the banking crisis and unemployment are central to everything that is happening in the country.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Do you see my problem?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	26	How could this committee, which seems to be central to Cabinet and Government — I think the term is "cross-cutting committees" — manage to have a two and a half month holiday?  It is a reasonable question.In regard to its counterpart committee dealing with social inclusion, children and integration, would that committee have had an opportunity to discuss the social impact of the report of the McCarthy committee, an bord snip nua, in particular the impact on children of the cuts proposed by the McCarthy report?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	27	These matters impinge on Cabinet confidentiality.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Cabinet meets every week, sometimes more than once a week and, from time to time, twice a week, depending on the workload or requirements.  All of these matters are discussed at Cabinet.  Cabinet committees can meet in smaller format and their purpose is to provide assistance on specific issues that arise or specific areas of policy that require co-ordination or further discussion.  That is the basis on which the economic, social or any other committee meets.  Frequency of meetings is not a full indicator of activity or consideration being given by Government in respect of any of these matters.  Full Cabinet meetings deal with these matters extensively on an ongoing basis as a priority.  I cannot go into any more detail, other than that, to explain the workings of the committee.In regard to the committee on social inclusion, we have been dealing with all those matters in full Cabinet meetings.  The Deputy asked about various reports being considered by Government.  We are beginning the budgetary and Estimates process.  A very serious challenge to our public finances exists and we have to come forward with a budgetary position which will meet that.  From our point of view, the role of Cabinet committees is to supplement the role of Cabinet and not to replace it.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	29	On climate change, I was glad the Taoiseach attended the United Nations summit on climate change.  It sent out a very important signal.  I also welcome his statement today that he will ensure the facilitation of a meeting between the sub-committee and the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  Would it be possible for the Taoiseach to attend that meeting, because he is chairperson of the sub-committee?  It would be important for us to have a round-table discussion in advance of what will be decided in Copenhagen.  Can the Taoiseach give the House some clarification on the advisory panel?I understand the climate change committee has an advisory panel of in-house civil servants and senior departmental officials.  Who are the members of the international advisory panel mentioned by the Taoiseach?  I am a little unclear on the role of that panel.  I will not ask the Taoiseach about the agenda for tomorrow's meeting of the sub-committee because the rules of Cabinet confidentiality prohibit him from giving me such information.  However, I advise him that certain organisations representing the interests of the developing world are concerned that our overseas aid budget will be hijacked to ensure we can meet our obligations under the EU's climate change policy.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that does not happen?  Will he focus on the additionality that is so important if we are to protect the overseas aid budget?  I understand it is no longer proposed that heads of state will attend the Copenhagen summit.  Does the Taoiseach share that understanding?  Perhaps he will update the House on the matter.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I have asked the relevant officials to support the idea of close co-operation between the Oireachtas joint committee and the expert panel on climate change and energy security.  I have written to the Chairman of the joint committee to suggest that the best means of achieving such co-operation is to engage in discussions with the relevant officials.  We await the outcome of that process.  The members of the informal expert advisory panel on climate change — those who are offering us advice — are Professor Stefan Proost, who works in the faculty of business and economics, within the department of economics, at the University of Leuven in Belgium; Professor Alan Matthews, who is a professor of European agricultural policy in the department of economics, within the school of social sciences and philosophy, at Trinity College Dublin; Professor Frank Convery, who is a professor of environmental studies in the college of human sciences, within the school of geography, planning and environmental policy, at University College Dublin and is also the chairman of Comhar; Professor Thomas Sterner, who is a professor of environmental economics at the University of Gothenburg; Mr. Jack Short, who is the secretary general of the International Transport Forum; Mr. Paul Watkiss, who is an independent consultant specialising in environmental and economic policy advice;  Professor Brendan Walsh, who is the professor emeritus of economics at University College Dublin; and Professor Peter Clinch, who is a special adviser to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I have not yet heard who will attend the Copenhagen summit.  I am sure there are plenty of rumours and views on who will or will not attend.  I hope the summit will take place.  I think many Governments will be represented at the summit at the highest level.  The heads of government and state focus on this urgent global issue whenever the European Council meets.  It is usually an important item on the agenda.  I am not quite sure to what Deputy McManus referred when she spoke about overseas development aid.  It is obvious that we will seek to meet our burden-sharing commitments, just as everybody else will.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	31	While I hope the Taoiseach attends the Copenhagen summit, I understand that will probably not happen.  Does he accept that it would send a strong message if the Government were to publish a climate change Bill before the Copenhagen summit?  Even if the Bill had not gone through the Oireachtas, its existence would indicate that Ireland is playing its part.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Bill that has been promised by the Government will be published by that stage?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Deputy will be aware that the Government will have to consider many legislative commitments between now and then.  Obviously, there is a view that the climate change Bill can be worked on.  At the moment, the real issue is whether the Copenhagen summit will be a success.  There are many major policy issues and further discussions will take place to try to ensure that states such as the US and China will engage and be in a position to contribute to a solution.  The UN conference to which the Deputy referred arose on foot of the efforts by the UN Secretary General to create more political momentum as we enter a critical phase of negotiations.  The conference was successful in that regard but everyone's focus is now on converting political momentum into political will and outcomes which measure up to the challenge.

Some drew an equation between the passage of Lisbon and the creation of jobs.  Will the Cabinet committee on economic renewal now address the need to formulate a plan or strategy to seriously tackle growing unemployment levels in this State, given that the Government has not produced any such strategy since the general election of 2007 and certainly has not since the current economic crisis began?Would the Taoiseach agree that it is nauseating to hear some economic commentators refer to the so-called first shoots of recovery as indicative of the clock having turned when they are actually referring to the international stock markets, that is, the very gambling dens which contributed heavily to the creation of the crisis in the first place?  Would he accept that the real first shoots of recovery will not be international stock markets but the reversal of the trend of growing unemployment across this country?  Unemployment currently stands at 440,000 people and this figure is projected to rise significantly over the coming months.  Can he give the House an assurance that the Cabinet committee will be coming forward with proposals to tackle the unemployment crisis through real and imaginative initiatives that curtail the continuing haemorrhage of unemployment and create new and sustainable work opportunities?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The role of the committee is of course to assist the economy back to recovery in whatever way we can.  With respect to Deputy Ó Caoláin, that cannot be done in a void.  It must be done on the basis of a stable financial system both domestically and internationally.  The purpose is not to bail out banks but to ensure we have a system which is geared to bring about the recovery that everyone seeks.  Without a functioning and viable financial system, our prospects of recovery are greatly postponed.  The reason priority must be given to this matter is because of the global nature of the crisis in the financial markets.Our second consideration is improving competitiveness in the Irish economy.  Now that we are in a recession and experiencing depleted demand for the goods and services we provide to international markets, we need to be competitive and maintain market share in order to sell in similar volumes, if with tighter margins, the goods and services we produce and provide.  Unless everything we do is geared towards that objective, the availability, sustainability and creation of jobs is put at risk because that is the only way we can increase enterprise and opportunity.I reject the assertion that the Government lacks a plan.  We have provided a mid-term fiscal consolidation plan which has been approved by the EU, as we were required to do.  Through our smart economy framework, we have also provided a mid-term economic recovery programme emphasising areas of the economy which can create wealth and jobs.  At the same time, we are required to correct our public finances because otherwise we put at risk the sustainability of public services and, more important, divert the resources currently being provided by the people towards increasing debt and interest repayments.  I remind Deputies, however, that while we have a large deficit, we have a relatively low debt burden compared to some other countries because of our prudent management of finances in terms of halving our debt during the good times. That headroom, which is now available to us in the coming years, must be prudently managed and prioritised towards areas of activity that will generate economic growth and provide us with the prospect of recovery.  That is the position.The decision made on Friday last by the Irish people is a positive step by all of our citizens to help effect recovery by showing confidence in the strategic direction in which this country must go.  While there would be democratic debate about all of these matters, the vast majority of the Irish people indicated that they wanted the European Union to be part of the framework for recovery in this country.

For instance, what is his position on the German approach of giving support to employers to retain people at work rather than facing the even more costly situation of growing numbers on the employment queues?  Just to give us a sense of where he stands on same, has he given any consideration to that proposition?

There is a commitment given by Government over the two fiscal years to meet that commitment up to the tune of €250 million.  That is a significant commitment in terms of that aspect of employment support, while at the same time everyone must understand that unless the economy is competitive, the prospect of maintaining existing jobs — let alone creating new jobs — is put at risk without that adjustment that must be made.

Similarly, ensuring systems are in place to secure value for money across the bodies that are funded from my Department is also a key priority.Against this background, my Department has put in place a range of financial monitoring, performance measurement and systems review mechanisms.  These include the regular carrying out of independent audits, value for money, VFM, reviews, programme evaluations and the measurement of programme and scheme outputs against targets set in the annual output statement.  The findings arising from each of these review and evaluation systems are monitored by my Department and acted upon.I should also advise the Deputy that a programme of direct project verification and evaluation is carried out by my Department's dedicated inspection services and where value for money issues arise, these are followed up.As the Deputy will be aware, I am committed to meeting on a regular basis the many people, groups and communities across the country that my Department serves.  Where issues or concerns are raised with me on value for money issues regarding schemes and programmes delivered by my Department, or in the context of bodies funded from its Vote, I can assure the Deputy that any such issue or concern is followed up assiduously.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	38	This Department has probably come under the most scrutiny as a result of the report of an bord snip nua.  An bord snip nua recommended abolishing the Department, discontinuing the RAPID programme, reductions in funding for community and voluntary support and phasing out the CLÁR programme.  However, the most damning matter is that the Department of Finance raised fundamental questions to the Minister in written format on whether we are getting value for money from Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Údarás na Gaeltachta could not provide information to the Department on how much it was costing per job, on its level of debt and on the amount of grants paid out.I want to make my own commitment.  I am committed to rural Ireland.  I am committed to this Department.  Fine Gael is committed to rural Ireland, but we are also committed to getting value for money.  If the Department of Finance is worried about us not getting value to money, I want to know what the Minister has done since he received the letter from that Department querying his Department on value for money, and what precautions he has put in place.  Has the Minister contacted Údarás na Gaeltachta to see whether it can give the Department the information on staffing and on the cost per job?  What has he done since that letter was sent to him from the Department of Finance?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Information on staffing at Údarás na Gaeltachta is readily available to my Department, which monitors the organisation on an ongoing basis.  Údarás has a good record in job creation; for example, 1,269 new jobs were created in Údarás-assisted companies in 2008, while full-time employment in Údarás-supported enterprises was 8,193.One of the issues that arises is that of the cost per job, which is sometimes queried.  I have made criticisms in this regard in the past, and I understand Forfás has now moved away from the cost-per-job measure and is employing a more complicated and thorough way of considering value for money.  I recently met representatives of the board of Údarás to discuss this issue.  My view was that in considering the cost per job we must also consider the sustainability of the job.  Thus, if we spend money on an industry that goes on for 30 or 40 years, the cost per job, taking into account the years of operation and the repayment to the State in taxes and so on, cannot be compared to that of a company that lasts for five years.  Therefore, I stressed to the representatives of Údarás that they must consider the sustainability of the jobs created, the risk element, and the benefit to the Irish language.  The latter consideration applies to Údarás more than to any other State agency.  I would put a higher premium, for example, on jobs created by Údarás that not only sustain viable employment in the Gaeltacht but also sustain the language in the area.  That is the whole justification for having a separate agency in the Gaeltacht.

Has the Minister spoken personally to the Taoiseach about this, and has he assured the Minister the Department will be left intact in light of the McCarthy report?Has the Minister monitored the schemes he set up — some of which are very good — to see whether we are getting value for money?  If not, will he put something in place to monitor them?  I want to see real jobs for real people in rural Ireland.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	41	As the Deputy knows, I always look out for value for money.  The Deputy mentioned schemes I was particularly associated with setting up, of which I will take three examples.  The rural social scheme, which costs €7,000 more per year than keeping the same person on unemployment benefit or farm assist, is incredibly good value for money in terms of the amount of work done.  The report I launched recently at the National Ploughing Championships will testify that the payback from the scheme is a large multiple of the amount of money we put in.  In addition, when one considers the social benefit of providing these people with employment and preventing them from living a lonely life without any outside activity other than farming, one must conclude the scheme is a success.Because of the CLÁR programme, there are houses in rural Ireland that have water from group schemes; we were willing to provide a top-up to prevent people in rural Ireland from paying inflated costs for water, and that was justified.  I have been very strict with local authorities, as the Deputy knows.  In his own county I refused to pay because the local authority did the work first and then applied for the grant.  Anybody who tells me it is not a worthy social objective to give high-quality piped water to the houses of rural Ireland does not understand the problem.The local improvement scheme for roads project has also been good value, although I have questioned the prices given by local authorities and so on.  We do our best to monitor these matters, but I believe it is value for money.  If we move on to rural recreation——

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Like Deputy Ring, I am interested in rural Ireland and the local and community initiatives that have been undertaken.  My concern in this regard is that although expenditure will be decided in the context of the budget, the recommendations have been put into the public arena now.  I have listened to the Minister say he has conducted reviews and so on.  However, in the McCarthy report it is stated, "There is little evidence of positive outcomes for these initiatives."  My concern is that the Minister of State and his line Minister did not put their case strongly enough to the group.  Did they put any case at all, or was it the Department of Finance that did all the running?  That matter must be cleared up.We heard the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, say there were many things in the McCarthy report with which she did not agree, and there are certainly many with which we on this side of the House do not agree.  I am talking about reductions in the allocation not only for local community development programmes but also for many other programmes.  In recommending a reduction in the allocation for the community services programme, the report states, "There is little information available on the outcomes achieved through the scheme."  It seems the Ministers did absolutely nothing——

The Deputy mentioned specific instances in which the report was not supportive of programmes or stated there was little evidence for positive outcomes.  I do not agree there is little evidence of positive outcomes from those initiatives.  I refer in particular to the local development social inclusion programme and the community development programme.  It is my objective that my Department's schemes and programmes, whether delivered directly or on the Department's behalf, give good value for money and meet the needs of all the communities and people we serve.  In this regard, they are quite successful.  My belief is based on successive independent reviews, audits and studies and, more importantly — the Deputy will agree with this — the detailed feedback I receive directly from communities and groups on a daily basis.That being said, I have had concerns for some time about the manner in which we have programmes running in parallel. I knew we needed to redesign the community development and social inclusion programmes and it is in that regard I made the announcement a number of weeks ago that the programme would be redesigned to provide a single mechanism of delivery in order to be more effective and streamlined.  However, I do not agree with the comment that these programmes do not deliver benefits for communities.  I have seen it first hand.  More importantly, however, these programmes have been running for a number of years and we have had a number of independent reviews and audits of their outcomes.

On 2 September 2009 I addressed a meeting of college representatives and householders from around the Gaeltacht on the subject. As I indicated, the recommendations in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes represent a set of options for consideration in the context of the 2010 budget and will fall to be examined by Government at the appropriate time.  Issues relating to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language will also fall to be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht in the context of its work in the preparation of the 20 year strategy for Irish.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Abolition of this scheme would be the greatest national scandal.  There are three Gaeltacht areas in my constituency of Mayo to which people and families from Dublin and all over the country come to learn and to speak Irish.  This provides an income for many people in those areas.  This year, but for the Irish colleges, there would have been little tourism in the Gaeltacht.I want the Minister to assure the people involved in this scheme that the grant will be available to them next year.  They need to know this now to plan for next year.  These people have already endured cutbacks this year by the Department of Education and Science in terms of grant aid.  The Minister and his Department are responsible for promotion of the Irish language.  The Minister already referred to the Irish language strategy.I disagree with the Minister's remarks on the McCarthy report.  It is a Government report.  It was paid for by Government.

Will the Minister reassure the people involved in the Gaeltacht and promotion of the Irish language that this scheme will continue next year and that the necessary grant aid will be available?  It is only right that it should continue.  There is no point in being hypocritical in terms of promoting the Irish language if at the same time we introduce measures that take people away from the Gaeltacht.

I, too, was involved in setting up an Irish college.  The Irish colleges benefit the Irish language.  Some 95% of people surveyed stated they are favourably disposed towards the language.  I attribute much of this to the generations of people who have had positive experiences learning the language in the Gaeltacht.  The Irish language has brought Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas together.  I have often remarked that many people here have an attachment to Gaeltacht areas be it in Donegal, Mayo, Kerry or Galway.  It is good to note that the numbers of people visiting the Gaeltacht are holding up despite the downturn in the economy.  The only significant drop has been in Donegal.Everybody, including the media and the Opposition, agrees that cutbacks are necessary but no one will state in what areas these cutbacks should be made.  The Government will have to make hard choices and will have to make cutbacks.  However, in making those hard choices I will reflect on the support Deputy Ring has shown today for the Irish colleges.  I take from the Deputy's support that regardless of what cuts are imposed by my Department he would not wish to see any in this area.

More important, has the Minister made representations to the Department of Finance to ensure that funding will be in place for next year?I know from where savings can be made.  Do not go ahead with NAMA and take some of the money being given to the banks and invest it in the Gaeltacht areas.  That is a simple solution.

The Government subsequently accepted the recommendations of this broadly based group.  I am satisfied that in developing the strategy full consideration was given to all aspects of the drugs problem, including through the comprehensive consultation process involved.The strategy seeks to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  This pillar approach is being retained as it has to date proved effective, was widely supported throughout the consultation process and dovetails with the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2009-2012.  The associated actions of the strategy comprise a well thought out plan of what needs to be done to achieve the overall strategic objective.  They are workable and will have positive results.Among other things the new strategy focuses on the co-ordination arrangements.  The changes made in institutional structures facilitate the Minister who is given responsibility by Government for the drugs strategy to effectively fulfil that role.  These changes will also streamline administration and facilitate more effective co-ordination and partnership.Funding will be scarce over the coming years and we must ensure optimum use of available resources.  However, it is important to be aware that these resources are considerable, with the estimated expenditure on the drugs problem across Departments and agencies in 2009 being in excess of €275 million.As part of the strategy I will twice a year meet various Ministers and officials directly involved in seeking to address the drugs problem.  At these meetings, which have already commenced, I will endeavour to ensure that high priority is given within Departments and agencies to achievement of the actions of the strategy.  I will also stress the importance of the continued effective implementation of other programmes that impact on the factors underpinning problem drug use.As part of the institutional arrangements to support the work of the office of the Minister with responsibility for drugs, the strategy provides for the establishment of an oversight forum on drugs.  The forum, which I will chair, will have its first meeting this month and progress across the strategy will be reviewed and blockages addressed.  The difficulties facing our society as a consequence of problem drug use are significant and addressing all the factors involved is an onerous undertaking, whether in the area of reducing supply, improving treatment and rehabilitation or continuing to promulgate the prevention message with a view to effecting attitudinal change in Irish society.  However, I am determined that real progress will be made across the period of the new strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way to achieve implementation of the agreed actions.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	68	It appears funding is at the top of everybody's agenda.  Last week, we heard loudly and clearly from the streets the response from the community sector to local drugs task forces, after school projects and community employment schemes.   While I am aware the Minister of State does not have a crystal ball it is important these groups know what funding will be available to them into the future.The national drugs strategy report, which comprises 125 pages, lists what the statutory groups want for communities into the future and sets out what response is needed in the current crisis.  The Minister of State stated that the drugs problem has changed.  I agree that it has changed; it has worsened.  In every community young people are getting involved on a daily basis in drug abuse.  Many young people are dying because of drugs.  We heard in the statement made last week by Tony Geoghegan of the Merchant's Quay project that each week 20 new people involved in drug misuse attend the services.  I attended the launch of the report and I listened carefully to what the Minister of State had to say.  I was struck by one of his comments, about which I was very angry.  We are proud, as a nation, of our tradition of giving to communities, particularly in the Third World, and I was disappointed to hear the Elton John AIDS Foundation had to provide €750,000 towards needle exchange services in this country.  I am sure there are other charities in England and elsewhere that are more needy than ours, and the Government has failed to put money into the national drugs strategy.  It is a glossy document and it does not indicate to me or to the community at large what will happen in the future to many of our young people.I refer to a statement about homelessness in the report.  What plans has the Minister of State under the strategy to involve more volunteers who are the voices of communities rather than paid officials in deciding what is needed in their communities and how the problem can be tackled?  Many of them are being left on the outside.

As I stated in reply to earlier questions, the budgetary position for next year is not known.  However, it is important that these considerable resources are spent in a co-ordinated way to ensure we are achieving maximum output and delivering effective services to the groups that need them.  If we believe we can make a substantial change in addressing the drugs issue, we can have all the treatment we want and seizures by the Garda but the attitude and behaviour of people ranging from children at risk, school children to adults who talk about soft drugs and recreational drugs must change.  Prevention is the area where we will make the most significant change in the strategy.The Deputy asked about the involvement of community activists.  The strategy builds on community involvement through the drug task forces and, in particular, the establishment of policing fora, which provide access for community representatives.  Local task forces and the new established office of the Minister for drugs have community representatives on the drug advisory group.  We recognise the role community groups have to play and they have been accommodated throughout the development of the strategy.

Decisions on specific matters referred to by Deputies will be made in that context.  Matters relating to the Gaeltacht will be also considered by the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht in the context of its work on the preparation of the 20-year strategy for Irish.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, said that members of the Department met with the committee that published the McCarthy report, but that no Minister or Minister of State from the Department did so.  Was any documentation presented at those meetings?  If so, is that information available to spokespersons from the Opposition?  In all the documentation I have seen, it seems we have put forward a very poor defence of these schemes.For the €100 million that the McCarthy report claims was spent on CLÁR, how many employment opportunities were created from that spending?  Over what period were they created and in what areas were they created?  If we are to take it that meetings took place and we are to look at the McCarthy report as published, it would seem as if the defence of these schemes was meek and timid, to say the least.  How can we rectify that matter?  Were papers exchanged?  Can the Minister give us some detail on the benefits to rural communities by the investment of €100 million?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I do not know the totality of the papers that were made available, or what was their status.  I will find out what can and cannot be made available.  There might be some FOI issues, but I am not sure.  I will look into it.I do not know how many jobs were created.  I do not know if anybody knows.  It is very hard to get cause and effect.  I worked for many years in job creation.  It is not just about creating jobs, but about creating sustainable jobs.  It is about something growing to a stage that it no longer needs further State support, but keeps growing and growing.  The measure of job creation is the number of jobs created by the number of years they are sustained and the number of jobs they, in turn, self-sustain.  I do not know if anybody has that data.  We can collect endless figures and make endless cases.  However, we must make sure that the collection of the data does not become more important than doing the work.  I have no doubt as to the efficacy of the schemes we run.  We have debated these time and again during the Estimates process.  If one believes that there are schemes such as CLÁR, RAPID, the Gaeltacht schemes and so on that should be wiped out, then I am all ears.This was meant to be an independent report.  The idea that we can have an independent report which only states what the Department thinks is a kind of a nonsense.  Of course, given that it is an independent report, we do not have to accept the findings.  I was a little bit surprised, shocked and horrified when my colleague mentioned that not all the proposals in the report would be implemented.  Everybody in this House would disagree with aspects of the report, and say that the experience of the people writing it would not be the experience of the Deputies on the ground of the efficiencies of various schemes.  I think the scheme I inherited has grown and is run efficiently.  I do not accept the criticism of the community services programme that the outputs are uncertain.  I guarantee that if we were to stop the community services programme, there is not a Deputy in this House that would not be in here with multiple delegations, explaining to me the importance of the schemes of that programme in his or her local community.  Every Deputy would be in here and they would tell me that it is a tragedy that anybody was even considering cutting back on that scheme.Mr. McCarthy obviously had a different view, and he is entitled to that.  It is an interesting report and there are some very thought provoking proposals in it.  My officials are looking at every one of his proposals, and writing our critique of his critique.  That will work its way through the system and the Government will make decisions on where we go from there.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I think the Minister may be misinterpreting what I am saying.  I agree with these different projects, but the Minister is only now talking about a reply to the McCarthy report, when in the first instance he should have been in there fighting his corner.  The doubt has been cast on these wonderful programmes, and the Minister has allowed that doubt to be cast on them.  He is now going to write the critique, but it is too late because the general public thinks differently following the McCarthy report.  The Opposition spokespersons were not given any opportunity to be part of the case for the defence.The case put forward by the Department was obviously too weak.  The report constantly states there is no evidence for the programmes, so is it not a bit late to be putting forward evidence when the door is closed?  The Minister needs to come out strongly and he will have our support.  Deputy Ring is supportive of the schemes, and I am supportive of the schemes, because they are all involved with the community.  If the McCarthy report is trying to close down rural Ireland and if the Minister continues to write up reports at a late stage, then he will assist Mr. McCarthy in doing that.

The report also stated that there is an obligation to translate every document into Irish, which is factually incorrect, as the Deputy knows because he was in the House when this issue was being legislated.  Mr. McCarthy is entitled to his view and we are entitled to our view.  The great thing is that the McCarthy report is only a report.  It is the Government that will make the hard decisions, and there will be hard decisions.  Anybody who tells me that he can save €4 billion and not make any cuts anywhere is not living in the real world.  We have hard decisions to make and we will make them on this side of the House, because it seems to me that they are telling us on one hand to make the cutbacks, and on the other hand, they tell us to make some other cutback but not the one at hand.The decision to commission the McCarthy report was purposely done so that the Ministers would not write the report.

The Deputy knows this and should make his judgment as to whether the evidence on all our schemes is publicly available or not.  If there was any criticism levelled at us, it was that we were getting too many reports commissioned on Leader and Gaeltacht schemes and so on.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	99	There is much repetition involved here.  I call on Deputy Ring.

It was the job of the Minister and his departmental officials to defend the Department.  Instead of that, the McCarthy report and the Department of Finance have stated that they could not get information from his Department.  He could not tell them the cost per job in Gaeltacht areas.  He could not even inform them of the number of staff in Údarás na Gaeltachta.  It is here in a letter from the Department of Finance.  We need life in rural Ireland.  The Minister and his Department are creating a problem for us because the McCarthy report states that there is duplication.  There is certainly duplication.  We have so many agencies in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere doing the same job.  That is where the problem lies.  It is an industry in itself.  I go down to Erris where there are many agencies.  The Minister promised a one-stop shop, but it never happened.  We need a one-stop shop in Gaeltacht and rural areas so that people can be dealt with there, whether it concerns Údarás na Gaeltachta, employment, social welfare or whatever.  Instead of that we have a clutter of organisations.  We need to clean up this situation fast.

They are aware from working of the huge resistance and delays put up against that process.  In recent weeks, I had to tell the three umbrella bodies there used to be for the community — partnerships, planning for the earlier partnerships and Comhar Leader na hÉireann for the Leader companies — that I wanted one umbrella body and that 1 November was D-day for that.  This is after nine months.  I credit the Opposition with supporting this type of rationalisation.  As Members are aware, the Minister of State announced recently that we will do a comhtháthú and will bring the community development programme, CDP, and the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, into synch because there is duplication in that  area.I am working on the question of Údarás na Gaeltachta but this is difficult because issues have arisen with which I must deal.  In the longer term, we should not have both Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG, and Údarás na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht.  There should only be Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I have stated this publicly and am working slowly and steadily in that direction.  However, we cannot bring this type of change about overnight.  People have employment rights and there are various procedures to be gone through.  There must be a reasonable time for consultation.  I have taken the view, with my Minister of State, that when we have gone through a reasonable period, we will have a decision day, as we have now for the umbrella bodies.  Decision day for them is 1 November.  I look forward to the continuing support of the Opposition when we continue with the process of rationalisation.

We have done a significant amount for the Irish language in the past ten years, and will continue to do it.  The recommendations of the McCarthy report are just recommendations.  Therefore, unless and until the Government accepts them, there is no point in criticising it for something that has not yet happened.  The proposals in the McCarthy report and the 20-year strategy for the Irish language will be considered in tandem.  We will publish the 20-year strategy and those decisions will be reflected in the budget for next year.  The 20-year strategy is a long-term strategy and we will look way beyond the short-term problems we have with finance in laying out the strategy.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Government is committed fully to the Irish language.However, in looking at existing schemes, it would be a mistake for us to get trapped into believing the schemes we have currently are necessarily the optimal schemes.  I have questioned and question again whether giving a grant to children of four or five years of age whose language was decided when they were born does much to convert English speaking families into Irish speaking families.  I question whether that money would be better spent on supporting language transmission to children when they are born rather than trying to work a miracle that never works of converting the language of a child at four years of age.

It is important before more harm is done that in the interest of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language Gaeltacht communities are reassured as soon as possible that these schemes will not be discontinued.

The Deputy can take it therefore that the coláistí Gaeilge will go ahead next year.  Even a full implementation of the McCarthy report indicates this.Scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge has been one of the most effective schemes agus go bhfuil sé tar éis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar bhealach nár éirigh le haon scéim ó thús athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Creidim gur ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuil an oiread cainteoirí breátha Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ná de bharr scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge.  Bhí mé i Ros a'Mhíl le gairid nuair a d'oscail muid ionad nua do Choláiste Chamuis.  Mar is eol don Teachta freisin, bhí mé thuas i nGort an Choirce.  Tá mo Roinn ag déanamh infheistíochta sna coláistí Gaeilge.  Mar sin, mar adúirt an Taoiseach faoi na coláistí Gaeilge, tuigeann muid tábhacht na gcoláistí Gaeilge.  Táim sásta sin a rá anseo sa Teach, ach ní shin le rá nach féidir athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na scéimeanna go ginearálta.

I understand from Foras na Gaeilge that a new competition was advertised lately and that several applications were received by the deadline of 4 September 2009.

They looked to Foinse for assistance.  It is appalling that we cannot have even one Irish language paper.  Will the Minister put pressure on Foras na Gaeilge to ensure that whatever grant aid is required by the group seeking to reproduce this Irish language newspaper is available and that Foras na Gaeilge announces quickly who has won the contract so that the paper can be up and running again before Christmas.  The paper is a big loss to Irish language speakers, to the Gaeltacht and to the people who lost their jobs.  I hope some of these people will be re-employed.  Some of the people involved used to cover the Irish language issues in the Dáil.  I hope the Minister will arrange everything behind the scenes to ensure the paper is up and running soon.

It is in the interests of everybody in the House that I maintain that particular stance.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Yesterday, a former Member of the House from the Taoiseach's party branded Fianna Fáil as a party of sleaze and corruption because of the actions of a minority of its members.  That branding came about because of the use and abuse of both privilege and power for quite a number of years by the persons concerned.It was not confined to Members of the House but also concerned persons associated with various organisations.  The issue concerning the former director general of FÁS, Mr. Rody Molloy, is a case in point.  The Taoiseach said here in the House, "The chief executive of that organisation is a person whom I hold in the highest regard and whose integrity I would defend at all times."  He went on to say at the end of this saga that Mr. Molloy had done the honourable thing.  On that, will the Taoiseach clear up a number of matters that are a cause of concern?  Can he confirm whether Mr. Molloy threatened legal action on his stepping down as director general?  There has been a deal of confusion about this.If he did not threaten legal action and was retiring, why then did his package amount to a golden handshake of more than €1 million on top of his pension?  I met workers from Waterford Crystal during the Lisbon treaty campaign who worked for 40 years and have no pension and they made the point about the gulf of anger in the streets.  The Taoiseach also said he had full faith and confidence in the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to deal with FÁS, yet he overruled her when she was about to issue a press release expressing full confidence in its board.  What did the Taoiseach overrule his Tánaiste if he had full faith in this sad FÁS episode?

As regards the specific matter the Deputy has raised on the director general of FÁS, the comments I made about Mr. Molloy at any time were and are based on my knowledge of the situation and of the person concerned.  It is a fact that I made those comments because that was my belief at that time.

In fact, on the day in question, Deputy Kenny said he was not challenging anyone's integrity at the time the resignation took place.  I do not want to get involved in personalising matters in that manner.The context of all this is that there was a controversy as regards travel arrangements which had been in place.  It was regarded as being in the best interests of the organisation that Mr. Molloy should move on.  That was facilitated as a result of a discussion that would take place, initially between the board chairman and himself, and which would be submitted to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and subsequently approved by the Department of Finance.

Securing a speedy departure in a non-litigious manner was considered to be in the best interests of FÁS, its clients and the taxpayer.  That was the basis upon which his departure was negotiated and effected.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I am not sure, arising from the Taoiseach's reply, whether Mr. Molloy threatened legal action or not.  This seemed to be a cause of considerable controversy throughout the country.  The Taoiseach says he made his comments in the House on the basis of his own knowledge, which he did, and he sees nothing that leads him to a contrary opinion at this stage.The comments by former Deputy Glennon were made, I believe, out of a sense of frustration and as a reflection of the anger of so many people at where mismanagement, lack of accountability and lack of transparency have lead this country.  It is evident from the information that under the director generalship of Mr. Molloy, the FÁS organisation, spending almost €1 billion of taxpayers' money, had very serious and glaring gaps in terms of accountability and management.  The Government now seems to be hiding behind a position where, to effect a speedy departure, a package "broadly in line", as the Taoiseach says, was produced.  I can tell the Taoiseach he would get thousands of people to line up for a speedy departure if he gave them a €1 million golden handshake on top of their pension.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Which was not to be mentioned until afterwards.The point is that what has happened under the stewardship of the Taoiseach and the Government is that although mismanagement, lack of accountability and lack of competence were clear at the very top of an organisation, which has done good work in many parts of the country, a person is rewarded with a golden handshake of €1 million on top of his pension.  How can the Taoiseach justify this?  How can anybody in Government, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, justify this by saying this was to effect a speedy departure so that the organisation would not be damaged?  The reporters of The Irish Times today deal with the case of a FÁS assistant manager who was charged today with defrauding more than €600,000 from the State training agency.  In order to effect a speedy departure and not to damage the organisation, a €1 million golden handshake on top of a pension, broadly in line with the guidelines, was effected with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and was signed off by the Minister for Finance.The Taoiseach knows Mr. Molloy — that is no fault of either.  However, the Tánaiste, as the deputy head of Government, and the Minister for Finance were fully in possession of all these facts about the mismanagement and lack of accountability at the top of FÁS when this deal was signed off on.  How in heaven's name can the Taoiseach justify a decision like this to effect a speedy departure by a person who, by his own admission, was lax in his competency at managing an agency spending €1 billion of taxpayers' money, where a golden handshake of €1 million applied on top of his pension?  From what perspective in regard to not damaging an organisation, and not giving the truth to the branding by former Deputy Glennon that the Taoiseach's party has become a party, in perception at least, of corruption and sleaze, can the Taoiseach justify this?There is a gulf in understanding on the streets, which this does not help, but the Taoiseach stands here, as leader of the country, and justifies a golden handshake of €1 million plus for the former director general on top of his pension.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's stance as to why this was agreed, in what circumstances it was agreed and how he can justify it when thousands of people have seen their savings go down the black hole of the banks, have no pensions and no time in their lives to reconstruct any kind of financial lifeline?  Can he justify that to the House?

I can understand people looking at this situation from the outside and making some effort to suggest we were doing something other than what was going to happen if the contract was terminated.  That is what had to be done.  We had to take that into consideration and move the situation forward quickly, which is what was done.  The approvals were sought and obtained.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	165	On Sunday, when I read the reports of the expenses claimed by the Ceann Comhairle over the past two years and the supplementary information which was supplied to us later in the day by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I felt that the pattern of extravagance was unacceptable.  It was unacceptable to me as a public representative, unacceptable to me as taxpayer and, I believe, unacceptable to the vast majority of taxpayers.  I considered that it was an something that Dáil Éireann would have to deal with, and deal with quickly.Recognising the independence of the office of Ceann Comhairle, I felt it was not something that should be done unilaterally or in a partisan way.  I wrote to the leaders of each of the political parties in the House suggesting that we should meet to discuss how this issue should be appropriately dealt with.  I suggested that there should be a reply by 2.30 p.m. so that we would know where we were going with the matter before the Dáil recommenced today.  I thank the party leaders who responded to me but I am disappointed that it has not been possible to arrange the kind of meeting I had envisaged.  I am particularly disappointed that the Taoiseach did not agree to such a meeting.  The issue that arises therefore is an issue of Dáil Éireann's confidence in the Ceann Comhairle.  Do the Taoiseach and the parties in government continue to have confidence in Deputy O'Donoghue as Ceann Comhairle?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	166	It is greatly to be regretted that the issue was brought to the House in this way.  I have said to the Deputy that I believe that the appropriate forum for a discussion to take place is the meeting tomorrow of the commission that is charged with responsibility for the running of the Houses and the privileges and various arrangements of the Members in this House.  The Ceann Comhairle has indicated that he intends to put his proposals to the commission on that basis.  That is the appropriate forum and we should await the outcome of that process.It is important that the confidence of the House in the Ceann Comhairle can be confirmed on the basis of a discussion and decisions that should be taken at that commission meeting.  I assure Deputy Gilmore that it is my view and that of the Government that we ensure full transparency in respect of all that we do here.  There is nothing for us to hide and nothing that we should hide.  We need public confidence in our democratic institutions.  I am of the view that the means by which that can be done is always in our interests.  It is on that basis that I have asked that that meeting take place at the commission tomorrow.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	167	A Cheann Comhairle, I did not want to bring this issue onto the floor of the House.  That is why I suggested the course of action that unfortunately has not been accepted, namely, that the leaders of the political parties would meet, discuss the matter and agree a course of action on a cross-party basis.I do not agree that the appropriate forum is the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It is essentially an in-house committee which deals with the administration of the House.  It meets in private.  It is not a political body in the sense that there is political accountability to it.  The Ceann Comhairle is elected by the Members of this House and therefore it is a matter for the House, for Dáil Éireann itself, to deal with.A Cheann Comhairle, I regret to say this but I consider that your position is no longer tenable.  I think you will either have to resign or be removed from office.  Following the Order of Business today it is my intention to meet with my colleagues in the Labour Parliamentary Party and to recommend to them the tabling of a confidence motion.

Before agreeing to take the motion on the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions, I seek a commitment from the Taoiseach on the accountability of all Ministers, Ministers of State and high officeholders in this Dáil, and more important, not only in the Dáil, to the Dáil but to the people.  That is what is critically missing at this point.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Deputy Ó Caoláin is accountable to the people himself.  He should not be lecturing us.

We must all be regretful of that.To help restore public confidence in politics, will the Taoiseach commit to a totally new approach to all expenses claims, including claims by Ministers and Ministers of State, where all such expenses are vouched, published and fully open to public scrutiny?  Will he ensure that that same regime applies to State agencies and boards?  Will he show that he is serious and that we are all serious about accountability and transparency by beginning that process with a call on the Ceann Comhairle to step down from his position, which in the view of many, including many in this House of varying views — let us make no mistake about it — has become untenable?  This is a crucial test that must be faced up to if we are to restore public confidence in politics and the democratic process itself.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he should accede to the requests I have made, which I believe also reflect the views of many in his own party's number in the Chamber at this time.  If he does not, I will call a vote on this matter.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I have made it clear in previous interventions today that as far as I am concerned that it is in the interests of this House, the parties in government and the parties opposite that we have a system in place that has public confidence in all respects.  I have always believed that should happen in respect of the issues Deputy Ó Caoláin has raised.  As far as I am concerned that can and should be done.On the other matter raised by the Deputy, the purpose of the Government is to ensure that we get on with the job of doing what now needs to be done in the aftermath of what we have seen in the referendum where people are asking that we get on with ensuring that we bring a stability to our public finances.  We will bring forward proposals in the coming months in that regard.As to the specific issues that were raised today, I am not in the business of impugning integrity nor saying things that might meet the populist view of the day on a specific individual.  My job is to ensure that we do what is right in respect of those agencies and organisations that are under our aegis.  That is what we sought to do.  We have to do so lawfully and the contention that we would do otherwise would have risked even greater expense on the taxpayer were we not to do so properly.

Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate, given the difficulties he faces with his Government and confidence, whether he intends to seek a full mandate from the people?  In the meantime, is it likely that Committee Stage of the National Asset Management Bill, if we get that far, will be taken in the Chamber?Arising from the vote of confidence given by the people on the Lisbon treaty question last Friday and given that other countries are moving swiftly to make their nominations for commissionerships, has the Government or Taoiseach considered the nomination of a person of suitable calibre to be presented to Commission President Barroso to guarantee this country a priority and high profile commissionership?

On the second question raised by the Deputy, that is a matter for the Government to decide upon.  A Commission cannot be formed until a High Representative is appointed by the European Council because the High Representative will be a vice-chairperson of the Commission.  The President of the Commission made this clear to me in a discussion I had at the weekend.

Two motions have been circulated on one sheet this afternoon.  The first of which is a motion from the Minister for Foreign Affairs seeking Dáil approval of the treaty of Lisbon.  It is not clear from the circulated text when it will be taken.  When will the motion be taken and will it be taken with or without debate?  I urge debate if that is permissible.I am putting the Taoiseach and House on notice that the second motion, tabled by Sinn Féin, is on the position of the Ceann Comhairle.Given that the people of Donegal resoundingly rejected the campaign for a "Yes" vote created by the political parties in last Friday's referendum, does the Taoiseach intend to make an early announcement on the by-election for Donegal South-West?

I believe the Department of Social and Family Affairs made a mistake in defining the workers' redundancy payments as income when it should have been considered a termination lump sum payment.  The result has been that the workers have been landed with a PRSI bill because the receiver at Waterford Crystal has refused to pay their previous employer's PRSI bill.  The workers have lost almost the total value of their pensions, not to speak of having lost their jobs.  I ask the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, to have his office look into the matter.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	200	A plethora of anomalies has been raised regarding non-principal private residences, including, for example, the position of parish priests who have bought retirement homes but whose primary residence is the parochial house.  Advice has been sought on this matter from the Attorney General who is working flat out providing information on the matter.  Given the large number of anomalies arising from the recently enacted legislation, does the Government intend to introduce an amending Bill?Many of those who live abroad, having left Ireland in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, have an ancestral home in their county to which they return for perhaps one or two weeks every year.  Are such persons liable to the levy on second homes?  Will amending legislation be introduced to address these and other anomalies?

It was promised in 2006, according to the legislative programme for that year.  It was again promised in 2007, according to the legislative programme in spring 2007.  It was again promised in 2008, according to the legislative programme in autumn 2008.  In this year's spring legislative programme it was stated that publication was expected, but that it was not possible at that stage to indicate when.  In this year's summer legislative programme the same was stated and in this year's autumn legislative programme, which was published three weeks ago, it reappears as "publication expected 2010".  Can the Taoiseach give a definite date as to when the new Forestry Bill will be debated in Dáil Éireann?

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I believe that the Bill before us regarding the National Asset Management Agency is the most important legalisation that will probably come before the Dáil in the next decade or decades, raising, as it does, issues not only for this generation of taxpayers but also issues for future generations.  It touches on an issue of inter-generational justice.  Surrounding this Bill there has been a neglect of its implications.  Any detailed analysis of the Bill has been replace by a kind of myth-making in which many have participated, which suggests that the NAMA legislation, as proposed by the Government, is, as has been put in some of the media, "the only game in town".I would like to begin by raising a few questions which are notable in the Minister's failure to answer them or to be addressed in the Taoiseach's speech.  The first question is why a Joint Oireachtas Committee on the banking system has not been established.  At one stage the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, seemed disposed to such a committee.  The issues are how we came to this position, what were the decisions taken and what were the great failures of regulation.  The suggestion is that we can move on without addressing them.  The Oireachtas Committee should be sitting now and addressing the issue.  The public want it addressed.The myth which covers for that failure is the suggestion that somehow or another, we were all guilty of an excess of spending or whatever and that this produced the financial crisis.  It is very difficult to have published the basic fact that 2,000 individuals make up €77 billion of what we are dealing with in regard to toxicity.  There are 150 individual borrowers who are responsible for €50 billion and Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, the heads of which have now gone, are responsible for €32 billion.  A question of the first order in the public mind is why we are not investigating how this circumstance came about.  The argument is that we are advance in our preparations for doing so, but perhaps the Minister or a member of Cabinet can reply and tell us when the inspectors will visit Anglo Irish Bank, return and put a report before the public on what went on there, which was scandalous by any consideration.The public are naturally interested in the fact that the top 15 borrowers in Anglo Irish Bank are responsible for €7.5 billion, some €500 million per client.  We still do not know the terms of reference given to the Garda Commissioner in regard to the possibility of fraud or inappropriate corporate behaviour.  The public is entitled to know this before it accepts the Bill for the new banking system, inform the new banking culture or acquire a huge burden that will go forward to future generations.The failures in regulation are being considered by those who are largely responsible for them.  There is no evidence of independent distance between the examination and the failures in regulation, which were scandalous — the only word that can be used for it.  People will be searching through remote footnotes in Central Bank quarterly reports to say that they warned of this or that.  It is a ridiculous but sad, pathetic exercise in bureaucracy that seeks to recover credibility where there is none to be found.In terms of the options before us, which are in the content of the Bill, one might reasonably ask what options were negotiated with the European Central Bank.  Let me clear something up.  The European Central Bank is simply accepting collateral from the Irish banking system, collateral which consists of Irish Government bonds.  It is not involving itself directly with the Government's failure or pathetic response to the toxicity it presided over because of its deadly political intersections.One might ask a question which is more than academic.  What would happen if, instead of taking over such a large bundle of toxicity, the Government decided to address the issue of the mortgage books of the different banks?  There is a tradition in this and many other European countries, such as Britain, of people paying their mortgages.  It would have provided the Government with a mechanism for achieving liquidity.  It would, in addition, have incurred a much lesser risk in terms of asset cover on behalf of the taxpayer and the Government would have been able to direct policy by restructuring the boards of the banks.  The Government would, most powerfully — a point I will return to — have been able to head off home repossessions of people in danger of losing their homes.The Government could have achieved this through temporary nationalisation.  It could have cleaned the banking boards.  It could have set up an agency to handle transitions from mortgages to leases to rental income and the right of return.  In addition, it could have a far greater guarantee for taxpayer into the future in terms of assets generating a real income. That would have created some stress for the bond holders, however.  I have not seen any evidence offered in relation to a number of other issues.  It is a matter of opinion.  In the short term, the public is entitled to know the terms of reference of the Garda investigation, which I have already mentioned.I would like to speak about the public interest directors, who represent another little cosmetic aspect of this proposal.  Every now and again, an opinion floats in from the directors.  The public interest directors will not be able to function very much unless the Companies Acts are amended in a manner that enables the Minister to define to the House what precisely he expects them to do by way of public interest.  I am reminded of the trammel on worker directors that was provided for under the Companies Acts.  In one company after another, worker directors were compromised by the fact that they were bound by the Companies Acts.  They were unable to act in the way that many people demanded of them.  In the case of the public interest directors, all that has happened so far is that someone who was once a politician became a banker overnight and described the reasonable request for the public to be given information as "prurience".  I assure the person in question that the correct rage which is at the basis of the public's demand to get answers to the questions I have highlighted is being guided by more than prurience.I read the speeches made by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach at the beginning of this debate.  It seems to me that they seem to be relying for liquidity on a change in banking culture.  If I had time to go through the Minister's speech, I would focus on his reference to the agreement that has been reached with Bank of Ireland or AIB for this year or next year.  There is nothing in the legislation to enforce liquidity.  This Bill will not change the banking culture that brought us to this poisoned place into something that can serve the needs of the real economy in liquidity terms.  The Taoiseach coined a new cliché when he started to talk about a banking system that is "fit for purpose".  Clichés can last for more than a decade in economics, sadly.  We wanted a system that dealt with banking rather than gambling.It is interesting how language can slip away in a manner that prevents us from engaging in a critique.  When I examined AIB's annual report, I read Mr. Dermot Gleeson's statement that "the turbulence experienced in the global economy and financial markets in the second half of 2008 was without precedent in our lifetimes".  I remind Mr. Gleeson that the salaries taken by him and the other non-executive directors were without precedent in any decent society.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance on becoming the majority shareholder in a bank that, according to Mr. Gleeson, is well capitalised, well diversified and has a strong balance sheet.  Mr. Gleeson, who was the Attorney General when I served in the Cabinet, also suggests in the annual report that AIB has millions of customers who do business on a regular basis and deliver repeatable earnings.  I assure him that his former Cabinet colleagues would not have been impressed with such speculative commentary.  It is like saying one thinks the piebald horse will win.The public rage has been informed by the notion that we can keep going as if nothing has happened.  We are not getting the kind of analysis we want, sadly.  I would have no difficulty with going in detail through the various issues that were raised in the Second Stage speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  Many questions have not been answered.  It seems that this proposal is based on a number of extraordinarily weak assumptions.  Where is the evidence that the property market has bottomed out?  I have the height of respect for the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is an intelligent man.  In his contribution, he quoted from a limited piece of data relating to the Dublin commercial property rental market.  It is important to note that the market in question is being sustained by legislation that stops commercial rents from decreasing, even at a time when businesses are going out of business and jobs are being lost in the retail sector.  One cannot draw general conclusions for any other sector of the rental property market from such a little sliver of data.It is interesting that everyone has accepted the myth of the month, which is that NAMA, as proposed, is the only game in town.  Those who believe it is the only game are not pressing for answers to the questions I have listed, nor are they testing the assumptions on which this notion is based.  It is interesting to compare Dr. Alan Ahearne's suggestion that we may be bottoming out with what he has said in academic publications.  In one publication, he described the cycle of property values as being approximately twice as long the cycle he projects when he speaks about the end of the Irish cycle.  One cannot analyse historical cycles by saying they conventionally finish within a certain number of years.  Dr. Ahearne must have been informed by some special evidence that has led him to change the theoretical position he previously espoused.  Perhaps he has been so informed.In their speeches, the Minister and the Taoiseach referred to the investigations that have been carried out in the main banks — AIB, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank.  When I refer to the long night in September 2008 for which we are paying such a high price, I am not interested in distorting anybody's position.  I appreciate the urgency of the situation at that time, but that cannot explain the conclusion that Anglo Irish Bank had the same systemic value as AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I can see how one could make the case that the disposal of the loan books of AIB and Bank of Ireland was linked to the future of the Irish economy.  However, the loan patterns that were approved are indefensible.  I could ask similar questions about the disposal of various assets — 36% of which are land, 28% of which are buildings and 36% of which are contractual paper — to which the Minister referred in his speech.  If I remember correctly, the Minister said at one stage that we were not exposed to any derivatives, in the United States sense of that term, and their toxicity.  I am not sure whether he said that last September or last week, but that is academic.  I would like confirmation of what precisely is meant by the third category of commercial paper.

I hope the Minister will agree to hold Committee Stage in plenary session so that all of us who have gone to the trouble of going through this Bill in detail will have an opportunity to ask him questions of this nature.As we look at this moving object, there is an assumption that the property market has bottomed out.  The Minister has suggested that an increase of just 10% in property values is needed if NAMA is to be a viable vehicle.  The first mistake with that assumption is that we will be moving 10% from where the Minister thinks we are.  When one considers the evidence that was presented before the High Court in the recent Zoe Group case, it is clear that we are dealing with a declining entity, rather than a stable one.  Therefore, one's 10% will have to be stretched a little further if one is to finish ahead at the end of the period suggested by the Minister.  The detail of the Bill seems to indicate that the Minister believes NAMA will restore liquidity in the real economy.  When the Taoiseach allowed himself a flourish earlier in this debate, he extended that point and said it would lead to renewed growth.  We all want that to happen.  We agree that we want the real economy to flourish  My problem is that the Bill is based on the Minister's assumption that he can expect a change in this country's banking culture without a fundamental change in the boards of the banks.  Approximately 80% of the board members are still in place.  The Minister seems to think that those who engaged in wild lending — most of the commitments into which they entered were abroad — will suddenly fall in love with the real economy.  When the Minister responds at the end of Second Stage, I would like him to spell out where he sees the evidence that he will be able to extract that liquidity from people. The ratio is improved through the issuance of a guarantee which they can in turn use as collateral for getting real money.  What is to stop them from reducing externally based liabilities rather than those which are internal to the Irish economy?  I looked through the legislation for the answer but the Minister is not taking any powers which would enable him to address that issue.  If he had gone down the road of temporary nationalisation and decided to enter discussions with the European Central Bank on using the mortgage books of lending agencies as the assets on which he would issue bonds he would be in an easier position in respect of preventing home repossessions.  I accept the good faith of Government Members in this regard.  Nobody wants to see repossessions.  Thus far, however, all we have achieved are tenuous six and 12 month agreements from banks which I simply do not trust.  That is where we probably differ.The matter is full of politics.  One should head off interest rate increases by putting in place a mechanism that protects the home if a person falls into arrears because of interest rates.  This is partly addressed by the aforementioned agreements but we should be able to turn mortgages into forms of lease, develop insurance mechanisms or transfer mortgages into tenancy purchase options.  I remind Deputies that in many cases both partners have had to work to sustain outrageous and unsustainable mortgages.  If conditions improve, people could move back along the chain and we would have a stable housing market.  Not to do that is to wait until the end of this or next year, when the banks begin to issue court proceedings or people start to apply to local authority housing lists.  I am simply suggesting an outline and if the Government does not pursue the matter I will advocate that the Labour Party establish its own commission under someone such as Professor Drudy to produce options which would ensure that even in the worst of economic conditions the family in the home will not suffer.I look for the paragraph in the NAMA legislation which deals with liens on lending institutions for preventing home repossessions.  This is not an abstract or academic point.  Similar proposals have been considered in the context of the insurance model in the United Kingdom and some of the mechanisms put in place in the US approach to avoiding home repossessions.  One would have expected similar proposals in the Bill before us.  I am not worried about what such a mechanism would be called.I have outlined a number of questions which I believe must be answered if we are to restore trust.  We need more than an assurance that we are creating a new culture of banking.  We need to see significant change on the boards and to receive all the information on how we arrived at this juncture and what was discussed with the European Central Bank.  We need to know why certain options were rejected and why NAMA was chosen above other solutions.  We must also reform the Bill on Committee Stage to give it the transparency it currently lacks.  Above all, we must be able to head off the worst of the consequences.  The option before us is a disastrous one.  It puts an albatross around the necks of this and future generations.  Even if the Bill passes Second Stage, let us at least put in place protections on Committee Stage so that families can remain in their homes until they climb out of the trough of unemployment and crisis economics.Let the odd person out of the 166 Members of this House recognise this paradigm of greed has failed both in Ireland and internationally.  Not everyone is guilty.  Like many people who built houses, I am aware that some craftsmen can cut timber or lay blocks while others can estimate the price of building a house or lay out a curved wall.  All these were replaced by people who put no value on these skills and who were told by banks to borrow on the basis of fantastic property inventions and price escalations of 300% or 400%.  Leading players in the banking institutions lashed money at these individuals.  These are the guilty parties and the Irish public wants answers to the questions I have posed.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	225	We all know that the banking system has let us down.  I do not disagree with Deputy Higgins in regard to the extraordinary greed of people in the banking sector.  As the private sector cannot solve this problem on its own, governments around the world have had to step in.  Credit is the lifeblood of the economy and we need a healthy banking system to support mortgage holders, businesses and service providers.  All Deputies more or less agree on the nature of the problem but shades of opinion differ on the solution.Since the advent of our severe economic problems in the summer of 2008, the Government's strategy has been to restore public finances, solve the banking crisis and restore competitiveness and, therefore, employment growth.  These are not easy tasks.  Some people in the big bad world believe the Minister for Finance can wave a magic wand and suddenly all is well.  However, months of work were required to develop a strategy.  After hearing from people both within the system and outside it, the Government came up with the NAMA proposal in April and draft legislation in July.  It is a bit rich that in recent weeks people have suggested bits of ideas they read in The Economist or the Financial Times.  The details of these suggestions are fairly sparse and, while they may have been valuable months ago, at this stage we cannot afford to waste another year by starting again from square one.  To quote Deputy Higgins, NAMA is the only show in town.

We have to work on the Bill before us.  It may not be perfect but we can improve it on Committee and Report Stages with some of the suggestions made in this Chamber.  We simply do not have the time to develop other proposals because we need to get the economy moving again.  If there is an upturn in the world economy, we must have our banks giving credit to good ideas and ventures to move forward.The homework on the Fine Gael proposal was not done in time.  Labour spent months speaking about nationalisation, which, I accept, is a lovely, sexy fashionable slogan, but we all know that even if one nationalised, one would still need some sort of agency to move matters on thereafter.  However, I was pleased to hear the leader of the Labour Party and others state in recent weeks that the party never really had in mind that there would be 100% nationalisation and that just increasing the equity share was what it had in mind.  If that was made clear months ago, we might have made progress and we might have had a greater understanding of where we were and gone some way towards reaching a consensus on some of the issues.Sometimes when there are significant problems it is no harm to reflect on the good days and the good that has been achieved.  The economy enjoyed a good spell over the past ten, 12 or 14 years.  There has been fantastic growth and improvements beyond what many of us would have thought of in our wildest dreams.  I always was impressed by the number of people working in the economy, where 15 years ago or so there were 1.8 million employed and then we reached employment of more than 2 million.  In recent years I was amazed, surprised and delighted on several occasions to see people who had not got a job for 10 or 20 years becoming employed.  In parts of my constituency which would not be regarded as well-off areas, entire households, not just individuals or fathers, had not got jobs for years, if ever, and the progress made in the economy in recent years made all the difference.  I accept that 200,000 of those jobs have now been lost — hopefully, temporarily — but there are still approximately 1.8 million people working which is much better than was the case when there were 1.1 million employed.We can look back as a society and state that we lost the run of ourselves.  I suppose everyone would say that another group lost the run of themselves.  Government was not the worst offender over those ten or 14 years.  When the coffers were full Government did extraordinary work — reducing the national debt, with the pension reserve fund and the various infrastructural projects.  We all enjoyed tax reductions and there were significant improvements in services in health, education, special needs and so on.This is not just a Government matter.  Much of the anger and hurt is because people borrowed vast sums for productive, and perhaps not so productive, purposes.  This recession is different from ones in the 1980s and at other times because of the level of personal debt.  Much of people's annoyance and hurt is because of the money people borrowed to buy property here and abroad.The economy is like a pendulum.  Some of the gains made in recent years were not sustainable when the pendulum swung in the other direction.  Many still feel that we could have had a soft landing, that we could have come down off our own ten-year high were it not for the world recession which came along and hit us for six.  We all are wiser after the event but, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins stated, the main blame for everything lies with the banks which were basically shovelling out credit.For five years I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing and I recall that for the first two or three of those my mantra at Question Time or when out and about was "Supply, supply, supply".  At the time I felt, as we all did, that only by increasing supply could one help to bring down and control prices.  Because people were no longer emigrating and because they had jobs, they needed accommodation and like anything in short supply, houses were too dear.  Then approximately half way through my five years in the Department I began to realise that something was wrong, that despite the supply house prices were still increasing.  Basically, it was because there was too much credit.  While I did not favour developers for the first couple of years, I really began to feel that the builders were not really at fault.  If there were people coming to look, not even at show houses but at a building site and a plan, to be told where their house or apartment would be located in a field, and if they were trying to knock the builder over with bits of paper showing what loans they had got from the banks, it was difficult for the builder not to increase his price.At that time I remember strongly objecting to 100% mortgages, not so much in principle but for the way they were being sold or advertised.  If one gave a 100% mortgage to a person or a couple who were well set in careers, that was all right, but at that time some of the financial institutions were giving out leaflets on Grafton Street at lunchtime, as one would give out leaflets promoting an early pint, buying a pizza or something frivolous.  Handing out leaflets encouraging impulsive buying and asking people to take out a mortgage with no deposit was shameful.  It was naked greed.  At the time as a mere Minister of State I made several references in speeches to the media about it and the general reaction was a mixture of being ignored and being rubbished.  I was surprised that many of the media were horrified at me sort of saying nasty things about the financial institutions and I remember being amazed at the way many in the media protected the financial institutions.  At that time I remember in the Department we had meetings with many organisations such as the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  We suggested that the amount that financial institutions put on deposit in the Central Bank in relation to their mortgages be increased by the slightest amount merely to give a message that we needed to put a gentle foot on the brake, but that was rejected.  They were not interested in hunches.  They always wanted quantified, verified researched data so that one had to prove everything to them ten times over before they would——

In the 15 months, life has moved on.  We have had the guarantee of deposits and liabilities and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, along with the acquisition of 25% shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  We now have billions of euro in impaired loans and banks are not servicing the economy, as we know.  However, we must deal with it and move on.NAMA is purchasing loans of €77 billion from the various financial institutions, for which we are paying €54 billion.  Each loan will need to be assessed and valued independently, but I am surprised that the valuations to date have come out so high.  House prices are down by about 30%, but I thought development land would have fallen much more in price.  I know the line that when somebody borrowed €100 million, theoretically that was only 75% of the investment, but I wonder about it.The most similar event I can recall is the winding up of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  After years in the Department of Finance, there must have been some conclusion to the file and recommendations about how to handle similar events in the future.  I would love to hear from the Department about these recommendations.  I can remember times when the banks were making major profits and we were all still paying levies to make up for the decision made back in the 1980s.  That is my biggest fear this time.  NAMA will work fine — that is not a fear.  However, I look into the future and see the banks making great profits again in ten or 15 years, while much of the residue — or crap, if I may use that horrible, unparliamentary word — is still left in NAMA.  Are we, as taxpayers and as the State, properly protected in this Bill?  How do we need to change it in this regard?I particularly like the arrangement that has been made to date whereby we have made a capital investment in Bank of Ireland and AIB in return for 25% equity, as well as dividends in the future.  However, if we must give all these resources, in whatever form, to the banks, I would like to have more equity.  I hope such things can be considered on Committee Stage.  My problem is not so much with the €7 billion long-term economic value — in fact, I was surprised that figure was not higher — but the €9 billion in rolled-up interest that we are taking over.  What are we getting for that €9 billion?  I know what we are getting in terms of the long-term economic value of the €7 billion.  That is reasonable, as one can only expect property values to rise into the future.  However, for the €9 billion, we should be getting an equity stake and we should be buying it at the share price that prevailed some months ago and not the current price.  It is on those points I have my concerns and I hope we can consider such things on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill and give the State and the taxpayer more protection.It is proposed to make lobbying NAMA a criminal offence, although I do not know whether such a provision is in the Bill yet.  Of course, any attempt to influence the valuations would be terribly wrong and should be an offence, but we must be careful that we are not becoming daft with such provisions.  I hope that if Deputy Noel Ahern were to write a letter or two to NAMA it would not be decided on the basis of a response to an FOI request in two, five or ten years' time that he was improperly lobbying.  We must be careful what we put into such legislation because sometimes it can be daft.  Everyone is against improper lobbying, but when a Deputy writes letters it is not the letters that do any harm.We have this Bill and we cannot afford to waste a year going back to square one.  It may not be perfect, but let us pass Second Stage and get on with Committee Stage so we can improve it for the good of society and the taxpayer and for our future.  In addition, as Deputy Higgins said, we need to include a guarantee that the banks do not just take the money and fatten their balance sheets with it.  It must be rolled over so that we achieve the outcome for which we hope.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I support some of the comments made by the previous speaker.  There are major questions over NAMA which need to be investigated and I am glad somebody on the Government side has admitted this.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Assets Management Agency Bill 2009, which is supposed to deal with what Deputy Brian Lenihan admitted to be one of the more serious issues in the history of the State.  He claimed that some of the commentary on the Bill was misinformed and even mischievous.  However, I assure the Minister that from speaking to people at both constituency and national level I know there is still much anxiety and real fear because of the failure of the Minister to clarify many of the issues about which he was asked at committee meetings and, since then, in his Second Stage speech.The Minister said the Government's proposal to establish an assets management agency had received the backing of the IMF and the ECB.  It has certainly received support for increasing its share of our two main banks, but there is no guarantee for taxpayers and no funding through the banks to keep small industries and businesses alive.  Only this morning I met a businessman in Monaghan who manufactures and supplies goods for the housing sector to county councils in Dublin and further afield as well as to the private sector.  He advised me that he would have to put his staff on a three-day week from next Monday, not because he is short of work but because he cannot get his payments in from either the private or the public sector.  Clearly the banks are not giving the necessary finance even to public-sector building projects, which should be a sure bet.  This means more people will end up on social welfare.Last night, together with my Oireachtas colleagues from County Monaghan, we met Castleblayney Town Council and the chamber of commerce, and it was simply impossible to explain to them how billions could already have been poured into the banking system while no relief is available for hard-pressed rate-payers in Castleblayney, which is on the Border and which receives the third lowest subvention in the whole of Ireland through the local government fund.  During the discussion in Castleblayney regarding Irish and UK VAT rates and the price of alcohol, it was stated that 50% of alcohol sales in the island of Ireland are actually in the Six Counties.  This is some indication of the loss of revenue occurring, especially in the Border area.  We were also advised that business owners were not able to obtain the necessary capital to keep their businesses going.  If NAMA does not provide this — and I do not believe it will — then some other rescue package must be put in place.Those in the Border region are extremely worried about the fact that NAMA does not cover banks such as Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank and ACC.  In fact, NAMA does not cover any borrowings under €5 million.  I am sure the number of people in the Border region owing more than €5 million will be quite small, thus all the banks, including Bank of Ireland and the AIB, will be taking their customers, including developers down the legal path, leading to forced sales at low levels.  This has already happened as has been well publicised in Ballinagh a few miles outside Cavan town.  People who bought houses only a year ago are now seeing similar houses in the same development being sold at less than half price.  How will NAMA, as it is now structured, deal with situations such as this and how can the Minister suggest that property prices are going to rise in the foreseeable future?  This structure, whereby smaller groups are not underwritten will curtail increases in property prices because they are not receiving the same benefit.Several years ago, I brought to the notice of a number of people the expansion of the housing boom.  In a constituency like mine, where little or no efforts were being made to maintain or produce permanent jobs, how could planners and for that matter builders and banks justify the mass production of houses?  In late autumn 2006 and again in February 2007, as we approached the then general election, I raised this issue with senior colleagues and members of my own Frontbench and advised them of what would be the outcome in this regard.  Anyone who at that time questioned the situation was accused by the then so-called saviour of Ireland of being negative and ill-informed.  The former Taoiseach of our country, Deputy Bertie Ahern, advised them to go away and commit suicide.The property bubble could not and would not have existed without the involvement of incompetent senior bankers who convinced themselves that they knew everything and that they in turn deserved huge salaries and bonuses.  It is impossible for the ordinary taxpayer to understand the role of the regulator or Central Bank in this regard.  Across the whole Irish banking sector there was a failure at board level and the question must be asked if boards were properly or legally informed by senior management.One cannot help but believe that the principle of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator was to hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil.  One cannot but believe that the whole ethos of the builders, developers and banks was laid down by the Galway tent brigade where everyone worked together with senior politicians in one big happy club.  The then Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, now the current Taoiseach, gave out the money from the building boom like there was no tomorrow and as if it was coming from a permanent genuine base.As far back as when the now European Commissioner Mr. Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance our party Leader Deputy Enda Kenny questioned the whole basis of the benchmarking structure and how it was put together but even then some of the relevant information had disappeared.  We now find ourselves in a situation whereby people who benefited from the benchmarking structures, in particular young graduates, who purchased expensive houses with loans of up to 100% of the cost of an overpriced property find themselves with incomes inhibited by levies and pension funds and the benefit of mortgage relief removed.  They now see themselves as victims of Government and bank mismanagement and they find it impossible to understand how bankers and developers are in reality the people who are being rescued.  I have no doubt they as taxpayers, together with their children and grandchildren, will have to pay for Government mismanagement and for the mismanagement of banks and developers.  While I appreciate there are some investigations into the activities of some people in Anglo Irish Bank and, possibly others, it takes a long time to come to grips with white collar fraud.  No one can call it anything less.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated in his Second Stage speech that the citizens of this country are understandably angry about the state of the banks.  They are bitterly disappointed by the failure of our regulatory system and are appalled by the details of the reprehensible behaviour of some in the financial system and property sector in whom they placed their trust.  They are also angry with the Government.  Many ask why we are putting money into the banks while they endure the brunt of the difficult budgetary decisions which must be taken.There is now, unfortunately, a breakdown of trust in the entire system, as was evident when we were out canvassing on the Lisbon treaty.  My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, asked on 22 September what is the logic of using over €36 billion in taxpayers' money — 40% of the total NAMA bonds — to purchase toxic assets from two broken financial institutions, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, that are almost certain never to lend again?  What is the Government's strategy for these two broken institutions? What binding mechanisms can NAMA impose on the other banks to use the extra funding from the ECB to finance lending to households and struggling businesses rather than paying down other expensive sources of funding from international markets?I want to return to an issue I raised earlier regarding the non-Irish banks.  It is impossible for me representing a Border constituency to understand how NAMA can be responsible for one-fifth of its assets in Great Britain, 6% in Northern Ireland, only two-thirds in Ireland and the remainder in the USA and Europe.  According to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, those developers and customers dealing with the Ulster Bank, NIB and ACC are being ignored on the basis that they will be supported from their home base in the UK, New Zealand or Denmark.  I would urge that this situation be re-examined as a matter of urgency to ensure there is no further damage to the Border area.  If all the non-national banks follow the lead of ACC and withdraw their services from the area this will minimise competition in the long term.  Of course, it will be customers, in particular small businesses, that will suffer.  I believe the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, must, as has already been requested of him by Deputy Richard Bruton, contact his UK, Danish and other colleagues to ensure pressure is put on these banks to deal sympathetically with their customers in Ireland.One other cross-Border group I must mention is the Presbyterian Mutual Society, which was clearly undermined by the introduction of guarantees to other banks.  This group has a number of investors from the Border region, some of whom are in serious situations since it was put into administration.  I am aware that the group's interests are under discussion at British Cabinet level and I, once again, urge the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance to show their interest in this issue as the amount of money needed to allow this organisation to survive in the interests of small investors is quite small.  Clearly, the percentage of the funds in this all-Ireland institution from south of the Border would mean that any involvement by the Irish Government would be minimum as compared with the billions being committed elsewhere.While I appreciate that if Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Independents, such as Deputy Mary Harney stick together the Bill will be passed through Second Stage, I urge the Minister and his officials to take seriously the well-intentioned, constructive amendments being but forward by my party Leader, Deputy Enda Kenny and our finance spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton.  They proved on 29 September 2008, when called on by the Taoiseach to support the introduction of the State guarantee, that they can put the country first.  Deputy Bruton's proposal for an economic recovery bank is clearly getting generous support from serious business people and economic advisors.  In that context, one must be concerned to hear the Minister say that NAMA has been drawn up on the best expert advice and counsel available to the Government.  Where was this expert advice and counsel during the past number of years which allowed us to walk blindfolded into this mess?  We can only hope different personnel are involved.With regard to Anglo Irish Bank and the type of personnel that were advising the Government on this issue, how can Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, be so sure that Mr. Seán Fitzpatrick of Anglo Irish Bank will repay, to use his words "every cent" that he owes the current bank?  If Mr. Fitzpatrick is unable to meet full interest payments on an estimated loan of €106 million, how will he ever be able to repay the capital?  It is difficult for someone under pressure to pay his mortgage to listen to Deputy Brian Lenihan making such comments when he knows that such repayments will not happen while nothing will be done for mortgage holders.  Imagine the situation for someone who had a high interest fixed rate mortgage who is now being told he will have to pay a further increase when the fixed term is over.The Minister and the Government have a major job to do to establish NAMA and, more importantly, to get it to work so business, jobs and private borrowers can see the benefit.  We will not tax our way out of this situation, we will only lose more jobs.  I was amazed to hear the leader of the Green Party on TV3 saying the Government would not deviate from the norm for Seán Fitzpatrick or anyone else.  What is the norm?  What was the norm as far as these people were concerned?I received an e-mail asking why only loans over €5 million qualify for NAMA.  What will happen to development loans of less than €5 million from Bank of Ireland or AIB Bank, the person asked.  He wanted to know if these banks will be instructed by Government to offer the same terms to holders of loans under €5 million as those offered by NAMA to holders of loans over €5 million.  The Minister for Finance in his speech to the Dáil referred particularly to the past conduct of the banks, as well as the distressed assets of developers as a consequence of the failure of the banking system and the economy.  Surely this applies equally to those who owe development loans of less than €5 million, asked the person who wrote to me.  How can we make fish of one and flesh of the other, he wanted to know.For many, answers to these questions are critical.  I have already stated that Ulster Bank, NIB and ACC should be included in these questions.  When the banks came before the committees some time ago, everyone was assured that they were sound.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and all these different people were in before the committees and we were assured there was no problem.  I fully understand there have been international situations but they were not the main cause of our problem.I support the Irish Farmers' Association in its opposition to a proposed 80% capital gains tax.  This is a serious situation.  Many good farms were divided by road building or similar infrastructure projects.  The land was taken through a CPO and now 80% of that money would have to be paid to the Government.  What will be left to restructure the farm or buy somewhere else?  This must be examined.  It is not a windfall if someone is forced to sell property, leaving his farm not viable.  It is back hand work that such a suggestion should be brought in through the backdoor as an amendment to the Bill.The idea must be reviewed because it will not bring in any money.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, used to blow about the lowering of taxes and how that led to an increase in receipts because there were more transactions.  Here, capital gains tax will increase from 20% to 80%.  It is absolutely outrageous and will hit farming and rural communities hardest.  It will destroy any opportunities they may have and I beg the Minister of State, as someone with responsibility for agricultural matters, to deal with this promptly.  It is up to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to make sure this ridiculous proposal does not go through this House.  It is unacceptable, unrealistic and will cause serious problems.  There is someone there who wants to get at the farming community and we must cry "stop" somewhere.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	233	This is possibly the most important legislation that has come before this Dáil and I support it.  The NAMA legislation is a response to the financial crisis that the country finds itself in as part of a global economic crisis.  As a result of our circumstances, we have been more affected than many of our European partners or other economies.I commend the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, who has undergone a baptism of fire since the crisis began a year ago.  At short notice and only a relatively short time in the portfolio, the Minister had to deal with it.  By common consent, it has been universally recognised that the Minister for Finance is coming to grips with this crisis and dealing with it in a commendable manner.There is a long way to go and the legislation before us faces a long journey through the Oireachtas.  It is in all our interests, however, that it is passed speedily.  I was glad to hear the Minister in interviews talk about accommodating individuals and parties if proposals were introduced on Committee Stage that would strengthen the legislation.  Early in the summer, the Minister published the draft legislation so interested parties could debate and consider it.  Of all the proposals made to deal with the unprecedented economic downturn we have seen, this is by far the best solution.  For that reason, I have no difficulty in supporting it.Some of the debate has been strange, to put it mildly, in that we hear individuals saying that in the good times the money was wasted.  I disagree with that theory.  Over the years we have invested wisely in infrastructure, with intercity motorways being a fine example.  We invested significantly in education at all levels, in teachers and in resources.  Local authority housing has seen a huge investment at a huge cost to the State.  One might say, looking back, that some of the prices we had to pay for those houses were inflated because of the boom in the construction industry.  I remember an answer to a parliamentary question three years ago that we would satisfy demand when we reached a stage when we were building 45,000 units a year and there would be a levelling off of prices for house price construction.  However, that building boom went on and we saw building of up to 85,000 units per annum.  Looking back now, that was clearly unsustainable.  Having said that, we are where we are and we have to deal with that.We invested wisely in some areas with more gardaí, nurses, teachers and this must be acknowledged.  This was happening at a time when we were running surpluses on an annual basis.  We have reached this stage in our economic development and we are now in a downturn.  There are individuals and families who are suffering.  There is not a Member of this House who is not aware on a daily basis of the hardships being encountered by them.  What disappoints me is the development of a social divide, where clear division lines have come between public service workers and private sector workers.  That will not resolve anything, and I ask individuals, groups or organisations who may be going down that road to recognise that it is a dangerous path to travel.  We are all in this together.  We will have to resolve this together, and I implore that we step back from that divide.  We have enough problems on our hands without dividing among ourselves.The NAMA legislation before us is a response to the global financial crisis which has caused extensive and rapid deterioration in the Government finances.  The principle of the Bill is worthwhile.  We will not work ourselves out of this financial crisis unless we have a stable and functioning banking system.  While mistakes were made in the past with the regulatory oversight of our banking system, as an outsider looking in, it seemed to me as though the banks were chasing one another, and all that happened was that one particular bank went off on a tangent, was irresponsible in its lending and was allowed to be irresponsible.  I blame our regulatory system for not reining in that bank.  As a consequence of that, other banks then decided to follow.  We had this tail chasing going on where banks were competing with one another to give out more and more funding for clearly unsustainable developments.  We now have to clean up that mess.  If there is one serious lesson to be learned by the Minister and the Department of Finance, it is that we must have a strong and functioning regulatory system that oversees our financial institutions.  The fact that we are now obliged to take a stake in our main banks means that we have directors on the board, and they should be in a position to see how that banking system works.The basis of the legislation is sound.  The loans will be transferred to NAMA at a discount, and while there may be some debate as to the level of the discount, I am convinced by the Minister's argument during his Second Stage contribution that the discounts will be brought back over a nine or ten year period.  Over that period, I hope that we will see a surplus as a result of working through these loans.  It is important that the assets are worked out and not just sold.  The principle on which the Bill is based can succeed and the loans will ultimately bear fruit, so that the Government and NAMA will not be at a loss.The Minister has been at pains to state that this has to be a transparent system.  The legislation clearly outlines that.  Some of the loans that will end up in NAMA will never be able to wash their face.  For that reason, it is a complete package that NAMA will take over.  It is also important that NAMA employs the best professionals to deal with this, not just on the basis of taking over loans and ensuring that value for money is obtained for them, but also for the valuation process.  The Minister has assured us that each individual loan will be examined and that a proper value will be put on that loan.   Having taken over the loans, he will need professionals on board and he has stated that he is prepared to outsource and get professional advice in dealing with them.  That is not just for dealing with the loan, but also for dealing with the asset that is taken on board.  There is development land that will clearly have a value for rental or whatever else.  The fact that some of this land is in highly desirable areas means that the State agencies could avail of some of this for schools, hospitals, Garda stations or whatever.  I am pleased to note that he has broadened the remit and that he is prepared to look at that aspect.The financial system has been severely challenged over the past two years.  This Bill will protect the financial institutions somewhat, and they need such protection at this stage.  It must be at a cost and they will have to pay for it, but our economic future is dependent on having a good financial system in place.  I would like to nail the lie that this is a bailout for borrowers or developers.  The Minister was very clear when he stated that loans which are transferred to NAMA are still due to be repaid.  NAMA is not an easy way out for borrowers or developers.  That message must be put out.  It is not a bailout for bankers or developers and that cannot be stated often enough.All international banks are experiencing difficulties in accessing funding at the moment.  When this Bill is passed, it will mean that our banks will be able to access funding again.  It is important that the Minister and the directors he has appointed to the boards of various banks ensure that there is liquidity and that the banks lend again to small businesses and farmers.  I met with a group of farmers yesterday, and one of the main difficulties they had was in securing working capital from their banks.  These would be farmers with a track record stretching back two generations.  Now, for the first time, they find it difficult to access working capital and funding from financial institutions.  It is important, when the legislation is passed and banks are in a position to access money, that the money is lent out.  That is the main purpose of the legislation.It is important that we put on record the support of our European partners, the European institutions and, in particular, the European Central Bank.  One shudders to think what might have been the outcome of this crisis had we not been part of a bigger, European community and the single currency.  In that regard, I congratulate the Irish electorate which, in its wisdom, supported the Lisbon treaty last Friday.  More than anything else over the past number of months, that support sent a clear message to our fellow Europeans that we want to be at the centre of decision making in Europe.  That is our future, it is where we have been for the past 30 years and is where we want to remain.  That message was sent out clearly on Friday.On the upcoming budget, I am aware the Minister has started to negotiate with various Departments about their funding for 2010.  He has a difficult task ahead of him to draft a budget that will be acceptable to the majority.  The direction he is taking towards spending cuts rather than tax increases is the correct way to go.  I heard it suggested today that if we take account of the levies imposed recently, we have an effective personal tax rate of approximately 52% or 53%.  We cannot impose much more personal taxation without returning to the bad old days of the 1980s, when we had a flourishing black economy because personal taxation was far too high.I wish the Minister well in getting this legislation through the Houses.  It is positive legislation and the best available.  We cannot allow things continue as they are.  This is the best option, although none of us wanted to reach a stage when it had to be introduced.  I wish it a speedy passage through the House.

This is one of the biggest gambles I have seen in the House in 30 years and like all gambles, nobody knows where it will finish.  It is bad enough that the ordinary members of the public would not know or might not be expected to know where it will finish, but nor do the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or the Government.One of the major reasons the people voted "Yes" in the Lisbon treaty referendum last Friday was because of the fear of the financial problems coming down the road.  They believe the European Central Bank is becoming an anchor tenant for Ireland and believe that is from where the bailout will come.  I hear Government commentators say regularly that the ECB promoted the idea of NAMA.  I am not sure we are handling the situation the way it wanted us to, but it will be central to it.  We are lucky the people of Ireland responded as they did on Friday.  I hope, for everybody's sake, this solution will work.I would like to give a background to the situation from where I stand.  It is a result of nothing but pure greed.  That greed was shared by developers and builders and accommodated by the Government.  Together they formed a cosy cartel.  For that reason, the people, no matter if they must wait five weeks, five months or two years for the Government to go to the polls, want to get this Government out.  They know they have been scuttled.  I will give the House an idea of how this happened, as it has not been mentioned often in the debate so far.Look for example at the countless thousands of young couples who bought houses at twice their value over the past five or six years.  These prices were as a result of the greed of the property developers, builders, economists, banks and all involved.  Now, these young couples face a drop in equity, but as long as they continue to live in their houses, they will get over that.  However, as interest rates increase, they will be in a far worse situation.  Worse still is that because of NAMA — there is no free lunch — these same people will end up bailing out the people who caused them to pay twice the value of their house in the first place.  Young couples all over the country believed they were doing the right thing when they bought their homes because every night on television economists from  financial institutions, a Minister or a Taoiseach, including the current and previous taoisigh, told them that the fundamentals of the economy were all right, that we had people in work and, in other words, they believed the prices young couples were paying for houses were good value for money.  That sort of rubbish went on for four, five or six years, but the economy was a bubble.  It would not have worked in any country.Now we have found ourselves in a terrible situation.  Young people are paying twice the repayment on a house they should have to pay, but if they had to sell the house they would be ruined.  At the same time, the NAMA solution will be brought forward.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  Sometimes Ministers try to get the message across that because of NAMA there will be no real cost, because after five or ten years the various properties will reach market value again.  Where could one borrow €54 billion on behalf of the State without a cost to someone?  Who is going to pay this money back?  It is very unlikely the builders or the banks will repay it.  They will come out from under the canvas yet.  It is because of this there is latent anger all over the country against the Government that allowed this to happen.We hope serious amendments will be introduced to the NAMA legislation.  I will not go through our proposals now, but there will be serious discussion in the Chamber on the amendments and, hopefully, the Government will yield to them. If the Government cannot ensure that the banks do not featherbed their reserves to build themselves up, and ultimately if the money does not return to the economy to provide jobs and help generate activity, then the anger will cut loose altogether.  Insufficient thought has been given to this because it is an easy way out for the banks.With regard to the Fine Gael concept of a good bank and a bad bank, at least pressure and responsibility would be put on the individual banks to try to straighten out what they had walked into at a time when even non-economists could see the banking system could not sustain such activity.  My constituents in Galway East and people further afield are asking me whether anybody will actually be brought to boot for this.  Will anybody be brought to court and sent to prison for the terrible problem that has beset thousands of Irish couples, for which they will be paying for the next 30 or 40 years?  As far as I can see there will be very few and the process will be very slow.The principle of the Bill is wrong and the gamble is too great.  Should the slightest thing go wrong, we will ensure that countless thousands for two generations to come will be saddled with something they had not a hand, act or part in.  From a rural Ireland viewpoint, the 80% capital gains tax that is being proposed as an amendment to the Bill is outrageous for land compulsorily acquired for road building.  That land was not rezoned.  It was acquired for a specific purpose, to build the roads.  I do not have time to talk about the problems such acquisitions cause for farmers, but this process has put them out of business.  When one considers the national good created, and that countless thousands will use those roads for generations to come for the benefit of all, the fact that the people who own the land will have to face an 80% charge is outrageous.  I assume this will be given much greater scrutiny over the next couple of weeks because it is a bombshell in rural Ireland, something none of us can put up with.I heard the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, say glibly here one day, in explanation, when there was some type of pressure on the budget: "If I have it, lads, I'll spend it and if I haven't, I cannot".  What way is that to run an economy?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I am glad to have an opportunity to talk on this Bill because it is probably one of the most serious pieces of legislation we will ever discuss in Dáil Éireann.  Apart from what went on today, which is a strange occurrence and something that has to be dealt with as soon as possible, the NAMA situation is very serious, and I do not believe it is being dealt with as it should be.  We are not being given the right information.My first concern is the book value of the loans.  I do not believe that the banks do not know the exact amount of the debt nor that Minister does not know the exact amount.  It was baloney to come in to this House, as the Minister did a couple of weeks ago, with estimates of $77 billion or €60 billion because they know the true extent of the situation.  Last October, 12 months ago, there were committee meetings here where the regulator and his staff told us they were starting to go into every bank to look at every loan and do their sums.  It does not take 12 months to put a portfolio of loans together and add them up.  If I have to get the Minister an abacus I shall do so, but he should not tell us, with regard to something as serious as this, that 12 months on, he is working on estimated figures.  That is unbelievable.  It cannot be true and needs to be corrected before we vote on this.Also last October we were told by the Regulator and his staff that developer debts and so on came to €39.4 billion.  On the night of the so-called mini-budget, some months ago, on the announcement of NAMA, we were told it was €80 billion or €90 billion.  I asked then, and I shall ask again today, how, in God's name, did it increase from €39.4 billion to €80 billion in less than six months?  We got half an explanation from the Green Party Minister the day after the mini-budget, to the effect that this involved overseas property of €20 billion or €30 billion.  Again, I do not believe that, so somebody misled us.  Either it was the Regulator and his staff last October, or the Minister is doing it here.On the night of the budget I repeatedly asked the Taoiseach, the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance to clarify the figure of €80 billion to €90 billion but they have yet to do so.  They never came back to me despite assurances and reassurances that they would check it out.  It never happened, yet we are being asked to vote on something such as NAMA.  If it is €40 billion and €30 billion of Irish developers' debts in other countries, why are we even considering taking up such property debts in the US, France, England and so on?  Whatever about the small merit there might be in having some type of NAMA for the Irish element, we should not be buying up the property debts that belong to Irish people in other countries.  That is fundamentally wrong and I want the Ceann Comhairle or the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, to know that I want this clarified — indeed, he might be Ceann Comhairle shortly enough.We are told that some of these loans will pay for themselves, and the Government will be able to pay for the cost of NAMA on a yearly basis out of the interest it collects.  Are we missing the point?  Some €9 billion is already owed in interest that has not been collected.  This group of loans are not paying for themselves.  Already they are €9 billion behind.  Why does the Minister believe that as of November, these people will start to pay their interest?  They will not and they cannot because they have been unable to do it for the last year.  If the banks cannot get their money I do not see how the Government believes it is going to get it because it is not available.We are told that the loan to value ratio is an average 70%.  Again, I cannot accept that it is an estimate and an average figure, 12 months down the line.  The situation is probably much worse.  I believe many of these loans have a loan to value ratio of 120%, 130% or 140%, certainly at the present value levels.  If the loan debt is €68 billion and the estimates are €48 billion or thereabouts, we are now at a loan to value ratio of 140%.  The Minister is citing a 77% loan to value ratio on the previous valuation, but that is just to massage the figures to make them sound better.  He should have inserted "now 140%" and let people realise exactly what they are buying into.  That is, 140% on the Minister's figures, given that the valuation of the property is 50%.  I want to deal with that now because it is not 50%.The Minister must be some type of genius with mathematics that he can come up with this, rent yields and every other formula, to try to show it is 50% of the valuation.  It is not 50%.  We all know that on the open market it is 13%, 14% or in some good places, 20% for development property.  Development property and land is completely different to someone's house or a usable asset.  It is an empty field, and its valuation is certainly not 50%.  Therefore it is wrong to mislead the people that it is because it is not.  It is as simple as that and we should not be making decisions on false information.Even before the current valuations developers had loans of 100% or 120%.  Those people will not pay back their debts.  The Minister gives the impression that we are going to go after all this debt, and I accept some of the €54 billion might be collected.  However, many developers set up special interest companies when they were buying the land and separated themselves and their personal assets from the concerns which bought it.  Before we vote on this Bill, I want the Minister to explain exactly how many of these property loans can be chased up.  I have a suspicion that many developers cannot be touched because of their special interest companies.  They will be let go and the developer will stay in the big house with the big car while the poor little fellow will be struggling to pay a €300,000 mortgage.The Minister must know how many of these loans are to companies of a special nature, or to others.  The unfortunate small local builder who put up his own house to borrow money will lose whereas the big guys, the special few who had all the legal and financial advice they could pay for over the good years, made sure to separate themselves.  It is wrong of the Minister to give us the impression that he can hunt them down for their personal assets.  I do not believe he can do so and I want the point clarified because it is not clarified as matters stand.What was the Government's relationship with the regulator?  Was the regulator acting independently of Government advice or were he and his staff of some 200 linking up with Government and doing as they were told.  Something went seriously wrong and I can see the hand of Government evident within that.  It needs to clarified by the Government that its hand was not in it.  If it was not, so be it, but if the question is not clarified, I will have to assume the regulator was acting according to Government policy, not independently.  He acted wrongly, which we know.A previous speaker stated that people need to be punished and that the average taxpayer needs to see somebody being held accountable.  There is no sign of this as yet.  There was quick dawn raid on Anglo Irish Bank and that was the height of it.  I am afraid to say it but we will probably never see anybody in handcuffs or being made to take responsibility, which is a great shame and will damage this country for a long time.  Nonetheless, people will lose their houses next year and the following year because they cannot pay small debts, which is very wrong.  I want to hear where we are going in that regard.I want to deal with the issue of a capital gains tax of 80%.  The Greens intend to fix all problems in one fell swoop but NAMA is not concerned with this issue.  I accept there is room to increase capital gains tax, but not to 80%, because the whole country will come to a standstill, if it is not at one already.  This Bill will not fix every planning problem of the past.  The Greens in their lovely speeches on the Bill spoke mainly about planning.  While planning must be fixed, it is not the problem of NAMA, which is concerned with financial planning and corruption.  It should remain focused on that area.Although I do not have time to examine it in detail, I want to put on record that the Fine Gael alternative to NAMA is workable.  Despite the Minister's puzzled look concerning it, such a scheme has worked and is currently working in many other countries, and it should be considered.  A NAMA-type structure in France cost the taxpayer there over €18 billion in losses.  In Ireland, the taxpayer has a potential exposure of €54 billion and, while I accept the Minister's point that we will not lose €54 billion, the potential does exist.  I believe many of the assets are much more toxic than we are being lead to believe.What the Minister proposes, based on the information he has given us, is immoral and wrong.  He does not care, however, because he will be out of politics when the real consequences are seen in 20 years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and I might still be here, and our children will certainly be here, when we see the real cost of this.  The issue is very serious.  It should not be dealt with as it is being dealt with in the House, namely, using false information.
#MichaelFitzpatrickFF	unknown-#MichaelFitzpatrickFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzpatrickFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzpatrickFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the problems besetting our country.  The collapse of the global economic economy, as well as our own domestic economic problems, have had a devastating on this country over the past 12 months or more.  We have seen thousands join the dole queues, businesses going under and people's savings being wiped out.Over the past year, the Government has undertaken a series of measures to stabilise the banking sector, including the bank guarantee scheme, which was supported by Fine Gael, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  As fundamental as these measures have been, they have not been sufficient to relieve us of all of our serious problems.  Throughout the country, businesses and households are being starved of credit, with dire consequences.  Without a properly functioning banking system, our economy will not function.  This is why the Government is setting up NAMA to buy loans from the banks and thereby remove uncertainty about the soundness of banks.All of the Government's actions in the past year have been centred on the common good.  The common good requires, first, a return to economic soundness — getting the public finances back in order, restoring our competitiveness and having a good banking system to serve the needs of the entire community.  NAMA must ensure that credit flows again to viable businesses and households by cleaning the balance sheets of the banks.  We would all like to see viable businesses receiving the required funding.  Nobody is asking that non-viable businesses be funded but it is imperative that businesses which are viable but struggling should be funded.NAMA is not a bailout for the banks or their shareholders.  It is buying loans at a discount and bank shareholders will have to accept losses.  NAMA is buying loans not properties.  The same applies with regard to builders.  Borrowers are expected to pay back the full amount and they will not be bailed out.The debt itself will be repaid through the repayment of loans from developers and other borrowers, or through the sale of the assets securing those loans.  It is intended that a levy be applied if NAMA incurs any loss over its ten to 15 year timeframe.  As I have stated, this is not a bailout for developers, as some have suggested.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has confirmed that developers who are insolvent will be liquidated and NAMA will have the full range of remedies already available to the banking system, including repossession, enforcement of mortgages, the appointment of a receiver and the liquidation of companies.Members on the opposite side of the House have argued that the Government is going to pay the banks too much for the bad debts.  In the Minister's words, the success of NAMA is not based on any assumption of a return to the recent bubble prices for property, which none of us would like to see happen.  It is not correct to state we will or would want to return to the bubble prices of the past.  Every single loan will be assessed on its own merits and will take into consideration that some property prices are artificially depressed because the banks are not in a position to lend to prospective buyers.  The value will be based on a realistic and prudent assumption about the recovery of property prices over the next five to ten years, or perhaps a little longer, and will be subject to European Commission approval.Some land will never be developed and will return to agricultural use.  NAMA will pay agricultural prices for such land.  It is only fair to note that some of these lands are not held by millionaires but by ordinary working people.  In other cases, the assets are more valuable.  We must remember that there is no liquidity in the banks at present.  They are not lending and there is effectively no market.  The introduction of NAMA will get the market working again.In addition, bank shares have been depressed.  This means that the banks have an incentive to work with NAMA to achieve a profit for the taxpayer and they do not get to share in any profits, as originally put forward by the new Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Patrick Honohan.  A number of other risk-sharing mechanisms have also been put in place to protect the taxpayer.  It will be a criminal offence to lobby NAMA and the agency and the Minister will be required to report on progress to the Oireachtas.Since the financial crisis began a year ago, the Government has made a number of decisions to stabilise the economy.  We are not alone in that.  A series of measures have been taken in the United States, the United Kingdom and across Europe to do likewise.  The crisis has highlighted that collective action is required as we now live in a global economy.  Today the Central Bank revised upwards its forecast on how the economy will fare this year.  It predicted a return to modest sustainable growth by 2011.  NAMA will get credit flowing again to viable businesses and households.  That is key for economic recovery and for the generation of employment.Some asset prices are artificially depressed because the banks are not in a position to lend to prospective buyers.  In those circumstances, the European Commission indicated the assets should be purchased at their long-term economic value.  That value will be determined on the basis of realistic and prudent assumptions about the recovery of asset prices over the next five to ten years.  NAMA will not be paying prices for the loans based on recent bubble property prices.  Nor will bubble property prices nor the expectations regarding future property prices that prevailed during the bubble period be used to determine the long-term economic value.  The means for calculating the long-term economic value of assets will have to be approved by the European Commission so that it does not violate EU state aid rules.  The banks will suffer substantial losses on the sale of assets to NAMA.  The amount of losses will differ across banks.  If, as a result of the transfer of assets, some banks are under-capitalised, the Government will inject the necessary capital by increasing the taxpayers' shareholding in those banks.  To date, the Government has ensured that any capital injections into the banks have had a substantial return to the State.Nationalisation of the banking system would not of itself clean up the banks' balance sheets.  Anglo Irish Bank proves that point.  NAMA is the best mechanism for repairing the banks' balance sheets so that they can start lending again.  However, the Government is prepared to take an additional, and if necessary a controlling shareholding in the banks following the sale of assets to NAMA.  Providers of funds to the Irish banks are sceptical about their land and developments loans in general.  Therefore, unless that entire category of loans is cleansed from their balance sheets, irrespective of whether individual loans are performing or non-performing, the banks will not be able to attract the funds they need to support lending to the real economy.NAMA will not overpay for the assets it buys from the banks.  The price NAMA will pay for the loans will, in general, be related to the current market value of the property, adjusted to the long-term economic value in accordance with the EU framework.  This price will reflect the likely return to NAMA from the assets over time.  Asset prices move in cycles.  Analysts believe we are nearing the bottom of the cycle, where nobody wants to sell because it maximises the loss.  Everybody is waiting for the economy to recover, including the banks.  However, the economy will not recover unless the banks are able to lend again to businesses and households.The Government wants to unlock this catch-22.  The banks will sell their land, development loans and associated investment property loans to NAMA at their long-term economic value in return for Government bonds.  The replacing of property-related loans with Government bonds will strengthen the balance sheets of the banks and that will increase their capacity to access liquidity in the financial markets and, if necessary, from the ECB.The management of the top 100 exposures will be taken out of the banks and will be managed directly by NAMA.  What remains with the banks will be managed under close supervision by NAMA and according to strict service level agreements.  NAMA also provides for a mechanism to give incentives to the banks to maximise the performance on the repayment of the loans transferred to NAMA.  Some institutions are likely to require additional capital to absorb losses and maintain appropriate levels of capital following the transfer of impaired assets to NAMA.  To the extent that it cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing the institutions with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements.Since the financial crisis began a year ago, the sole objective of the Government's actions has been the common good.  That requires, first and foremost, a return to economic growth.  Economic recovery is dependent on three key factors, namely, getting the public finances back in order, restoring our competitiveness by reducing our cost base and having a healthy banking system that will serve the needs of the wider economy.  NAMA will ensure that credit flows again to viable businesses and households by cleaning the balance sheets of the banks.  This is essential for economic recovery and the generation of employment.When the Minister for Finance spoke in the Dáil on 16 September last he outlined that he expects that NAMA will purchase loans with a book value of around €77 billion for approximately €54 billion.  The €77 billion is broken down between the following institutions: Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, the Educational Building Society and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  It is projected that 36% of the assets for which the loans were used were for the purchase of land, 28% was for development property and 36% was spent on associated commercial loans.  It is estimated that 40% of those loans are cashflow producing and that those will be sufficient to cover interest payments on the NAMA bonds and operating costs.The ECB states that NAMA is consistent with its guiding principles on asset support schemes and it is designed to comply with EU state aid rules.  The ECB states that "the preservation of private ownership is preferable to nationalisation", as that should prevent the high costs of nationalisation in both the short and medium term.Everyone is in agreement that what is required is a healthy, working banking system.  The course of action the Government has taken in establishing NAMA is based on advice it has received domestically, from institutions such as the IMF, and also the example of other countries taking similar steps.  We are convinced that this response will ensure the safety, stability and capacity of the Irish banking system, all of which are key to supporting our economic recovery.NAMA has requested 300 pieces of information about each loan that it will take over.  Each loan will be valued separately and the actual amount of the discount to be applied will depend on a range of factors, including the location and quality of the underlying property and other collateral.  The valuation method will have to be approved by the European Commission.  It is impossible to estimate the correct value of the loans to be acquired without that type of detailed knowledge and anyone suggesting otherwise is being disingenuous.Economic recovery is dependent on three key factors.  Ireland has the strength to ride out this economic downturn.  The economy will be well placed to benefit from the eventual recovery in the global economy because of its open nature.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The Labour Party motion before the House tonight is about basic accountability.  It is about addressing low standards in high places, which have been the hallmark of Fianna Fáil's hold on power over the past decade.The scandals exposed in FÁS and the failure of the Government to address them adequately, typifies all that is wrong with the Government's attitude to the public service.  The FÁS saga has been characterised by significant failings on several fronts, namely, a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money, an absence of accountability, serious breaches of procurement rules, a disregard for proper corporate governance, a lack of oversight by the board, an all too cosy relationship with the supervising Department, a back-scratching culture arising from close personal and political connections between the executive, the board, the Department and the Ministers, and a disgraceful indulgence by senior executives in lavish entertainment and first class travel for themselves, their wives, their ministerial masters and various other hangers-on.What makes the revelations in FÁS so difficult to take is the context in which they are set.  There are 424,000 people signing on the live register at present.  For many, notably those in the construction and retail sectors, there is unlikely to be much work for the foreseeable future.  In that context, they need a training agency that is fit for purpose.  They need an agency that is focused on identifying where they should upskill, and an agency that provides relevant and high quality training.  The scandals hanging over FÁS for the past 18 months have deflected attention from this basic goal of the organisation.  To some extent they have masked the dubious quality of many FÁS courses for the newly unemployed, the lack of co-ordination of services in certain areas and the short-term nature of much of the training courses offered.  This is where the focus of the organisation should be, and the absence of this focus is probably the Minister's greatest failing.The scandals are also set in the context of the call for wage restraint across the economy, but especially in the public sector.  How can the Government possibly hope to convince any public servant to accept pay restraint when public servants witness the massive waste and see a senior executive with a dubious track record walk away with a €1.1 million handshake and a free car to boot — especially when that golden handshake was overseen and sanctioned by the very Ministers who are advocating pay cuts?  How can the Minister possibly think people will accept that?  At a time Government Ministers are talking about cutting basic welfare payments to save money, how can this pay-out be justified?  Just a few weeks before the golden handshake the Government told us it could not afford a cervical cancer vaccine for young girls.For workers, taxpayers and citizens, this is contemptuous.  Taken together with the bailout of the banks, the bailout of reckless property developers and the ongoing excesses in the Office of the Ceann Comhairle, it sends a clear message that Government Ministers and others who hold senior public positions care more about themselves and their cronies than the public they are meant to serve.  The profligate attitude to public money so prevalent at a senior level in FÁS has tarnished the entire public service.  The failure of Ministers to deal with this wastefulness has also completely undermined the moral authority of Government and has played into the hands of those commentators who question the very principle of public service.I now turn to the severance package agreed with Mr. Rody Molloy.  There are several aspects to this agreement that remain clouded in mystery.  In the first instance, it is unclear under what legal instrument the top-up arrangements were made.  At the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 24 September 2009, the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated that the top-up was provided for under section 6(3) of the Labour Services Act 1987, yet Government Ministers now insist it was made under guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  If it were made under these guidelines, did anybody in the Department read them before they concluded the negotiations?The regulations show quite clearly that increased lump sum payments and enhanced pension entitlement for the departing executive of a semi-State body are only permissible in the case of the non-renewal of a contract or where a decision has been made to terminate a CEO's employment before the termination of the contract.  The guidelines specifically state, "It is not therefore appropriate to make such payments where the initiative for the termination of a contract comes from the CEO concerned."  However, both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are on the record as stating that Mr. Molloy resigned voluntarily.  The Taoiseach told the Dáil on 26 November 2008 that Mr. Molloy "tendered his resignation to the board of that organisation", adding later that "he tendered his resignation of his own volition...".  The statement issued by the Tánaiste on the previous day was headlined, "Tánaiste confirms resignation of FÁS Director General". Equally, the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Sean Gorman, referred consistently to the departure of Mr. Molloy as a resignation during his recent contribution to the Committee of Public Accounts.If Mr. Molloy resigned of his own volition, there was no basis for the huge financial package he was awarded at the expense of the Irish taxpayer, and the Tánaiste acted ultra vires.  If Mr. Molloy did not resign of his own volition, the Dáil has been misled in a most serious way by the Taoiseach.  There is a direct conflict between the accounts of Mr. Molloy’s departure given to the Dáil in November 2008 and claims now being made by the Government.  The only way to clarify this is for the Government to publish the text of the written agreement concluded with Mr. Molloy at that time.  I call on the Tánaiste to do that now.We also need clarity as to the role played by the Minister for Finance in approving the Molloy deal.  The Minister has ducked and dodged on this issue, avoiding giving a direct answer at all costs.  It was incumbent on the Minister for Finance, before he gave his consent to the deal, to be satisfied that both section 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 and his own Department's guidelines were adhered to.  The Minister and his Department would also have required evidence of the status of Mr. Molloy's departure — if it was a retirement or a removal from office.When the Department of Finance and the Minister heard the Taoiseach inform the House that Mr. Molloy "tendered his resignation of his own volition," they would have been aware that, prima facie, severance payments were impermissible under the 1963 Act and, further, were inappropriate and in total and express violation of the clear terms of their own guidelines.  The Minister for Finance needs to account for his Department’s total disregard for the law on this issue and this conscious and deliberate misuse of taxpayers’ money.  As regards the Minister’s role, he appears to acknowledge he was generally aware of the negotiations; he does not say he sanctioned and approved the deal such as would amount to consent for the purposes of the Act.  The Minister must also clarify the tax implications of the enhanced lump sum payment made to Mr. Molloy as well as possible benefit-in-kind implications of the famous company car.The question also remains as to whether there was a legal threat and how that impacted on the generosity of the agreed package.  The Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated, "The threat of the courts was hanging over us."  He went on to state. "It was also made clear that, if the individual believed that he was not being treated reasonably, he would reserve his right to take court action."  Last week, however, the Taoiseach was quoted as saying, "The situation as I understand it is that the overall package was offered on the basis that it would be the agreed way by which he would leave the organisation quickly...the question of the threatened legal action, that's a matter...which could have emerged subsequently if there wasn't an agreement."  Either there was or was not a legal threat.  Either a legal threat was or was not made clear to the Government.  If there was no legal threat, why the generous severance package?  If there was a legal threat, why was legal advice not sought?Reports suggest Mr. Molloy was granted his car as part of his resignation package.  As we learned recently, a FÁS car going missing is not exactly a new phenomenon.  This is all the more reason to ask if Mr. Molloy's FÁS car was part of his severance package.  If it was part of his package, who approved it and on what basis?  If there was no legal basis for it, can we have the car back, please?The problems at FÁS do not begin and end with Rody Molloy.  There is also a question of wider political accountability for the problems that have beset the organisation for several years.  The former Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputies Martin and Harney, must take their share of the blame for the excesses and absence of adequate controls in the organisation in the recent past.  They, too, practised their share of cronyism.In failing to respond to the problems, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, in particular, has a number of questions to answer.  Her actions so far bear all the hallmarks of a Minister scurrying for cover rather than tackling the serious issues in a meaningful way.  Why did the Tánaiste not take action on FÁS much sooner?  The first indications of serious problems at FÁS came from a Comptroller and Auditor General report as far back as May 2008.  That report identified a number of breaches of procurement rules, mismanagement of public money, overspending and a failure to achieve value for money.  What did the Tánaiste do about the report?  It seems she did little or nothing.  She dithered and delayed and did nothing until the second Comptroller and Auditor General's report was published last month, at which point renewed media interest forced her into paying some attention to the problems.As far back as February this year, the Committee of Public Accounts made several recommendations on foot of the first report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  None of these recommendations has been implemented to date.  Later revelations in the Sunday Independent about the extravagant spending by FÁS executives brought the full media spotlight on the problem.  Rather than sack anyone, the Tánaiste allowed the situation to drift and refused to take charge of the agency which had, for some time, been shown to be wasting huge amounts of taxpayers’ money.  Eventually, following public pressure she did an extraordinarily generous deal with the man who felt his only option was to resign.  The Tánaiste should have consulted the Attorney General for his advice and specifically to have him clarify what rights and entitlements, if any, Mr. Molloy had, given that he was resigning and was neither dismissed nor was he retiring.  This legal advice is available free of charge from the Office of the Attorney General.  If the Tánaiste had bothered to seek it, she would have been told that Mr. Molloy did not have any rights since he had tendered his resignation.Clearly, the Tánaiste hoped that by agreeing a sweetheart deal with Mr. Molloy, he would go away quietly and the whole FÁS debacle would fizzle out.  Not only did she behave recklessly in throwing away €1.1 million of taxpayers' money and act ultra vires, but she set a very dangerous precedent for other cases in that she has provided what amounts to a general, blanket acknowledgement that resigning chief executive officers are entitled to certain rights and entitlements, irrespective of the true facts and circumstances surrounding their departure.  The Tánaiste needs to make a statement regarding the role of the FÁS board in respect of the severance payment regarding the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  It is precisely this kind of action by Ministers which gives the public service a bad name and is seen to be condoning low standards in high places.  In any other jurisdiction, the Tánaiste would no longer be in Cabinet.Today, the Tánaiste published the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Yet again, however, she has not gone far enough.  From an initial reading, it appears the Minister will retain greater control of who is appointed to the board, perpetuating the cronyism that has riddled the FÁS organisation for many years.  This makes matters worse.  When the heat dies down FÁS will inevitably return to being the plaything of the Fianna Fáil Party.

This is a significant problem which I ask the Tánaiste to address.   Furthermore, it is astonishing, in light of the Molloy deal, that the Minister has published a Labour Services (Amendment) Bill which will not prevent further similar deals being made in future.  If the Bill is meant to herald a new beginning, it falls a long way short.The Government seeks to defend its position tonight by proposing a counter-motion which, in the usual self-congratulatory tone, seeks to pretend that the Tánaiste is doing something about the problems in FÁS.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Long before the Tánaiste announced her investigation, the Comptroller and Auditor General was conducting an investigation and the Committee of Public Accounts was hearing evidence from the parties involved.  While these detailed examinations must continue, by their nature they are taking place after the event.  What we need now from Government is for meaningful action to be taken.  The Labour Party motion seeks several key actions from Government to deal with the problems with FÁS and to effect greater accountability.  It is long past the time we saw these measures taken.I note that on this, the first night of this debate, not a single backbench Deputy from Fianna Fáil or the Green Party is present and the only person on the Government benches is the Tánaiste.

If they believe Mr. Molloy deserved his golden handshake, they should by all means vote to support the Tánaiste and Government.  If, however, they do not believe he deserved it, they do not have any other option but to vote with the Labour Party tomorrow night.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The Labour Party motion calls for FÁS to be refocused on its core work as the State training agency.  The organisation is needed more than ever.  As Deputy Shortall noted, almost 430,000 people are on the live register.  It is extremely important, therefore, that FÁS is made fit for purpose.  While the organisation has had many positive achievements over the years, in many respects it has not worked and has many faults.  In addressing the revelations surrounding FÁS and restoring public trust in the agency, we must ensure an employment agency emerges that can deal with the needs of jobseekers.The Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 published today by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not make provision to reform the functions of FÁS.  Section 4 of the original legislation, the Labour Services Act 1987 which established FÁS, sets out the purposes of the new organisation.  The needs of jobseekers in 2009 are much different from the needs of jobseekers in 1987.  We are playing a different ball game in terms of the type of employment we need to create in this period of unprecedented economic crisis.  What will the Minister do to reform the functions of FÁS in terms of how it provides services to job seekers and so on?I mentioned an OECD report in the Dáil, which was published last year, that examined the services provided by FÁS and made recommendations.  I asked for a debate on that report.  It did not happen and I have not heard the Minister discuss taking a broad review of the services of FÁS.FÁS has done innovative projects over the years.  It has trained thousands of apprentices and we have very skilled tradespeople here.  With all the talk about the smart economy, we must not forget that we will always need skilled tradespeople.  It is extremely important that we provide the best of education for our apprentices.  There are many issues.  We will require our apprentices to do different types of work in the future than was done in the past.  For example, there are issues about needing to conserve energy in homes, which includes the work carpenters and electricians do.There have been innovative programmes.  My brother went on a placement as an engineering graduate to Japan.  I worked on a social employment scheme in the early 1990s and it certainly helped me to get employment.  There were problems; it was not perfect and there were many gaps, which I will discuss later.  The McCarthy report recommends cuts in the numbers of special needs assistants by the Department of Education and Science.  Many such posts were initially provided through FÁS training schemes.FÁS training schemes have provided services in local communities which were not otherwise provided.  Many schemes are unnecessary; the picture is not all bright in terms of the work done.  However, there were innovative FÁS training schemes and much work was done in renovating heritage buildings and so on.  One problem is that in 1995 there were 40,000 community employment schemes but now there are approximately 20,000 and growing numbers of people are unemployed, including graduates who have no jobs and are sitting at home drawing the dole.  We need to do something about providing opportunities for people and FÁS is the obvious agency to do that.I will discuss the negatives.  In the OECD report I mentioned there is no engagement with jobseekers when they sign on now.  That is the reality.  People do not know where to go.  In Lucan a person who loses his job, signs on for the dole but nobody is in place to discuss his needs, direct him to the various agencies or tell him what courses are available.  There were 1,000 FÁS places announced by the Minister, which is a drop in the ocean, but most people in Lucan who have lost their jobs do not know about them and are reliant on people like me telling them about them.  That is not good enough.There needs to be much more engagement.  People who have never been unemployed before and have been in the workforce for years are being left without proper engagement with the various training agencies and one of the most problematic in that regard in FÁS, because it waits for people to go to it.  It does not go to jobseekers or examine their needs, except in a statistical sense, and that needs to be changed.There is a lack of feedback.  When I worked on a FÁS social employment scheme 20 years ago — I presume it is the same now — I was not asked if the scheme was any good, if it helped me or if training has been involved, because there was no training.  Nothing like that is done by FÁS.  There is duplication and a lack of liaison with other agencies such as the VECs and colleges who provide training and education for young people.There are issues about the way FÁS is structured.  None of that is being examined.  There is a problem regarding all the scandals that have come out.  There was a culture in FÁS which came from the Government, because there has been a culture of waste of public money and extravagant expenditure by the Government, which was followed through in terms of how the management and board of directors managed and governed FÁS.Several things need to be done.  Deputy Shortall raised the need to deal with ethics, the scandal about expenses and how the board of FÁS is structured and appointed, all of which needs to be followed up.  The recommendations in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts need to be implemented.  We also need to examine what we want FÁS to do, its functions and the services it provides.  That is the bigger picture.  The Minister has fallen down.  She must use her ministry to provide for the needs of jobseekers and make sure we have trained and skilled people for our workforce according to the needs of the future and make sure we have sustainable employment.There is a need, in terms of restructuring FÁS, to consult with the people who work there from the bottom up.  There are many good people working there and it provides many good services.  We need to bring everybody on board in the improvement of the agency because it is very important to our future economy.  There is also a need to consult jobseekers.  We should not just have statistics about the men and women who are unemployed.  We need to know exactly who these people are, what their needs are, what level of training they have, what area of work they have aptitude for and what services and training FÁS can provide for them.  When doing all of this it is very important that we engage all the agencies, not just FÁS, and work together to meet the needs of employees.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I thank the Labour Party for the opportunity to speak tonight.  What benefit or advantage from the scandal at FÁS have those who have been left unemployed by a Government-fuelled recession?  Was too much money spent on training initiatives or on unemployment schemes?  If any excess in expenditure arose in FÁS, it should have related to training, upskilling and providing employment and opportunities for the thousands of people unemployed.  There was massive institutionalised waste of public funds by Government and senior management in FÁS.  Who would have thought that the main beneficiaries in the State training and employment authority would be those secure enough in their jobs to go on holidays to Florida while the recession hit those who needed FÁS most.Today we see the publication of the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill.  While we welcome actions to improve the governance of FÁS and the strengthening of accountability, some of the provisions are laughable.  The greatest farce is the power bestowed on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Education and Science, to select the members of the board of FÁS.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, gave Rody Molloy an extremely generous golden handshake on his way out without getting legal advice.The Minister should not be empowered to make such decisions when her blatant incompetence has been plastered all over the news in recent weeks for all and sundry to see.  Reform has to be implemented as quickly as possible.  Sinn Féin already called for the Tánaiste to resign.  She has stood over the indecent golden handshake given to the disgraced former director general, Rody Molloy, and has shown herself to be incapable of addressing the unemployment crisis and getting FÁS to do the job it was set up to do.Unemployment continues to grow daily.  Young men and women join the dole queues in alarming numbers.  The unemployment rate in the country is more than 12.5%, but in my county it is now 27%.  A new board needs to address the dire unemployment crisis and put in place training and upskilling programmes to meet the needs of unemployed workers.  That this mess has been dragging on for the past 18 months is hugely damaging.  Time has been lost, during which training and upskilling to assist in economic recovery could have been put in place.Rody Molloy should have been sacked, fired, booted out and shamed for his disgraceful behaviour in FÁS, but he was not.  He was allowed to resign and save face having squandered millions of euros of taxpayers' money.  What we have seen is double standards in government.  Government officials across the board have looked after their own by making sure they got a little extra something, while workers across the State have been feeling this recession harder than anybody else.  Where was the Government intervention and support when, for example, the Thomas Cook workers had to protest in the headquarters of that company after being brought before the High Court for seeking a decent remuneration for themselves?  Rather than helping such workers, Government officials went to a seedy backroom to negotiate with Rody Molloy, fluff up his best egg and give him a pat on the back.  The FÁS expenditure scandal is another example of a branch of Government having no accountability.  We should not have to wait for resignations.  There should be no hesitation in sacking these people on the spot.  It should be a case of "do not pass go and do not collect your executive pension".Action needs to be taken now.  We need to put in place a framework to monitor and enforce accountability procedures.  These people are not above the law and should not remain in privileged positions when they readily abuse their power.  There is palatable anger among the ordinary citizens of this country as they struggle to hold onto their jobs, their incomes are slashed and Government taxes further reduce their take-home pay.  The Government has responded to that anger by establishing NAMA and offering extravagant pensions to directors.  It is totally out of touch with the people.  It has demonstrated its incompetence time and again.  It has neither the brains nor the brawn to get Ireland back to work and out of recession.  It has no mandate at this time.  It is so compromised by its close relationship with developers, bankers and oil companies that it is unable and unwilling to relate to working-class people.  An ideology of greed has manifested itself among this country's political elite, including the Government and its cronies.  The Tánaiste has suffered from ostrich syndrome over the last few months as this expenditure wastage was revealed.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, was embroiled in this scandalous affair during her reign as Tánaiste.  Senior civil servants also enjoyed the fiesta at FÁS.  It is apparent that burgeoning unemployment, cuts in social welfare and excessive taxes do not affect those in the Government's golden circle.Not only do we want an end to this behaviour, but we also want to know how it came about.  Who was to blame?  Where does the buck stop?  How was this allowed to happen?  The answer is simple.  As a former Member of this House said on television last night, successive Fianna Fáil Governments have developed a culture of corruption, cronyism and golden handshakes.  NAMA is a case in point.  The only beneficiaries of this form of Government intervention will be bankers and developers.  There is no NAMA for ordinary people, such as the young couples who are currently in debt to the banks, struggling to pay their mortgages or whose houses have been repossessed.  Young couples have been evicted by banks, which have then re-let those houses to those they have evicted.  The taxpayers of Ireland did not consent to this when they were forced to bail out the banks.  The banks, the developers and their political cronies have abused this country's system for their own greedy needs.  There is a culture of cronyism and corruption within FÁS and within the Government.  Deputies Coughlan, Harney and Martin have been embroiled in this scandal.  The controls that were in place were simply bypassed, public money was squandered shamelessly and senior management oversight did not exist.  The key issue that has to be addressed is the weakness in the system that allowed such wastage and disregard for taxpayers' money to occur without being uncovered.  We need to consider how these indignities were dealt with.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible to the Dáil for overall expenditure, employment and labour force policy.  How well has she done to date?  That her home county has the fifth highest rate of unemployment in the State speaks volumes in itself.  The result of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty in her constituency was a further reflection of the dissatisfaction of citizens with her job performance.  The underlying truth is that the buck stops with the Tánaiste.  I commend the Labour Party on proposing this motion.  I hope the legislation that was published today will deal with this problem, although I have my doubts.  We do not want the circumstances over which the Tánaiste has presided to arise again.  I refer, for example, to the expenditure of €600,000 on a television advertisement that was never broadcast.  Similarly, €9,000 was spent on a car for a raffle that was never held, while a further €622,000 cannot be accounted for.

andthe need to restore public confidence in the ability of FÁS to deliver on its training and employment mandate;commends the Government on:the speedy and appropriate response of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the issues raised regarding the lack of financial controls in certain areas in FÁS contained in Special Report No. 10, which came to her attention in May 2008, including:securing immediate clarification and assurances from FÁS that the practices highlighted in the Special Report No. 10 with regard to FÁS had ceased and that adequate systems and controls were in place to prevent any recurrence;requesting the Comptroller and Auditor General in September 2008 to undertake an investigation of the Advertising and Promotion activities of FÁS Corporate Affairs since 2000 and to report on the effectiveness of management and control systems across the FÁS organisation;obtaining confirmation from FÁS that it was now fully compliant with Department of Finance regulations regarding foreign travel;instigating a review by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment into the science challenge programme that resulted in the cessation of the programme and its related foreign travel activity;securing the speedy departure of the former Director General of FÁS without further damage to the FÁS organisation and interruption to the work underway to improve financial controls and governance at the organisation, on terms in line with the arrangements available should his contract have been terminated by the Board of FÁS;seeking a review of the severance arrangements provided to the former Director General of FÁS in the light of a recent statement from a FÁS board member regarding the deliberate withholding of information from the Board of FÁS; andensuring that FÁS implemented measures to improve financial control and governance across the organisation including:the restructuring and tightening of controls in the Corporate Affairs function, which is at the centre of the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation;the implementation of a revised structure for its Internal Audit including resources for additional staff and external co-sourced audits;the commencement of a full audit of all procurement locations by FÁS Internal Audit which is due for completion by the end of the year;the cancellation of all credit cards in FÁS with the exception of one which is used to purchase books and periodicals; andthe reduction of the FÁS advertising budget to a minimum;confirming her determination to implement all appropriate changes arising from the fourth interim report and recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts on Special Report No. 10 following its publication in February 2009, and the report (Special Report No. 66) and recommendations of the investigation requested by her and undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General into Advertising and Promotion in FÁS following it being submitted to her in June 2009; andpublishing legislation to amend the Labour Services Act 1987 so as to provide for a governance structure with greater accountability to the taxpayer, and including:the restructuring of the size and composition of the Board;removing the automatic right to nominate individuals for appointment as Board members from bodies not directly accountable to the taxpayer;making the Director General of FÁS accountable to the Oireachtas;a situation where a director's fiduciary duties do not prevent the P.T.O. director in question from reporting to the Minister;requirements in relation to disclosure and conflicts of interest; andprotection for members of staff who report serious wrongdoing in the organisation; andthe work of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in:refocusing and targeting FÁS policies and budgets on the particular needs of those unemployed and seeking work;putting measures in place to ensure that those who become unemployed are given effective employment services and training supports to assist their return to employment, including:doubling the capacity of the job search supports system provided by FÁS Employment Services and the partnership-based Local Employment Service to 147,000 places per year;the quadrupling to 92,000 places in short training courses, which are occupation-specific and will give individuals specific skills so they can compete for specific job vacancies;the introduction of specific initiatives to activate the unemployed including the creation of 3,800 places for redundant apprentices, increasing the total number of places on the Community Employment Scheme to 22,700 this year; and the introduction of an innovative new Work Placement Programme;the introduction of new FÁS courses to train and re-skill people for the new clean-tech and green economy; andinstigating a comprehensive review of the efficiency and effectiveness of labour market programmes, the report on which is currently being finalised."Since my appointment last year as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my goal has been to get the bottom of what happened in FÁS and to fix the problem in a way that ensures, to the best of my ability, that it does not happen again.  These are simple and clear objectives.  It is understandable that people can sometimes be frustrated by how long the process takes.  Members of the House will be aware of the importance of due process.  If I were to adopt a course of action that prejudices due process in any way, or if I were to deal with the serious issues that have arisen in FÁS in a purely politically expedient way, the Deputies opposite would be the first to object and to call me to account in this House.  The Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 was published today following proper and due consideration of the various issues by me, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Bill's strong and considered proposals send a clear signal to the public and to FÁS that there will be a root and branch cultural change in accountability and transparency at the agency.  I acknowledge that members of the Committee of Public Accounts from both sides of the House have rightly played an important role in the legislative process.  The importance of following due process was further emphasised today, in a separate development, when the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation decided to bring criminal charges against a FÁS senior manager for deceiving FÁS of taxpayers' money.  This is a significant indication of the seriousness with which the State is taking what has emerged at FÁS.  A further Garda investigation is continuing at the agency.  The work of both the Internal Audit Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General is also continuing.For the benefit of the House, I wish to set out some specific details of the actions I have taken since I was appointed as the Minister with responsibility for this matter.  The full extent of the content of the FÁS internal audit report, INV 137, which raised concerns about certain procurement practices in the FÁS corporate affairs division, came to my attention after the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 10 in May 2008.  That report dealt with a number of issues that arose in recent audits carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General on non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The issues identified centred largely on failures relating to procurement processes, governance and financial management.  In the case of FÁS, the Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that formal internal procedural guidelines were not observed in the corporate affairs division.  He found there was a failure to achieve value for money in the way FÁS managed its relationship with its principal advertising agency and the way it conducted business with contractors for major events.  He said that the absence of a strategic IT plan within FÁS while a website project was being developed facilitated the misdirection of resources.  Following the publication of this report, I took immediate steps to deal with the problems that had been identified.  When I met the chairman and the director general of FÁS in June 2008, I sought assurances that the issues raised in the special report were being addressed and emphasised the importance of FÁS securing value for money in its expenditure.  On 30 June, I instructed the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to write to the then director general to ask for a comprehensive report from FÁS setting out the measures it had taken to tighten its internal controls to prevent a recurrence of the practices raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  The then director general responded in writing on 1 July, setting out in detail the remedial actions taken in addressing my and my Department's concerns.  Notwithstanding the actions taken by FÁS and in the light of the seriousness with which I viewed the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 10 and the issues that emerged subsequently, in September 2008 I considered that it was necessary to have an independent review of the effectiveness of management and control systems in place across the entire organisation.  I therefore requested the Comptroller and Auditor General to consider undertaking a special review of FÁS and he acceded to that request.

This was in order to achieve reasonable assurance on whether there were any occasions of potential fraud or irregularity in that area other than those already brought to light by the FÁS internal audit unit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General confirmed that he would finalise the scope of his new review after the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts had completed its hearings with the management of FÁS in October and November 2008 regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 10 and the 2007 FÁS accounts.  The report of those hearings issued in February 2009, by which stage the Comptroller and Auditor General had begun preliminary inquiries in his new investigation.  This action resulted in the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report into advertising and promotion in FÁS in September 2009.

In the interest of allowing FÁS to focus on its core mission, an interim director general was appointed.  I again met the chair and some members of the board of FÁS and expressed my further concern at events that had taken place in the corporate affairs division.In regard to the issue of foreign travel in FÁS, I instructed the Secretary General of my Department to ensure that FÁS was compliant with Department of Finance regulations.

The review focused on whether the initiative as it then operated offered value for money and in drawing its conclusions would make recommendations with regard to its future.  The working group carrying out the review comprised officials from my Department, FÁS officials who had not hitherto been involved in the administration of science challenge, Forfás and Science Foundation Ireland.  Senior officials from the Higher Education Authority were also consulted.The working group's principal conclusions were that the science challenge programme was outside the main remit of FÁS, did not represent best value for money on the basis of efficiency, effectiveness and economy and offered no evidence to show that it had, in itself, contributed to the goals of the Government's strategy for science, technology and innovation.In light of the working group's findings, I directed the Department to make the necessary arrangements for the commencement of the orderly wind down of the science challenge initiative once all existing commitments for the 2008-09 academic year had been met.

However, this should not be interpreted as Departments having to take onto themselves responsibilities that properly belong to the bodies concerned.  That is why, in addition to my Department's monitoring of activities, the second mechanism for ensuring adherence to the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies is so important.  My Department ensures this is achieved through the assurances in the FÁS annual report each year that steps have been taken to ensure an appropriate control environment.  This is in line with Department of Finance guidelines that require that Accounting Officers should satisfy themselves that the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies are being implemented in State bodies under their aegis.

It also stated that the audit committee on behalf of the board conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal financial controls and that no weaknesses were found in the system which resulted in any material loss, contingencies or uncertainties being disclosed in the financial statements or the auditor's report on the financial statements.  It was not until the 2006 statement on internal financial control, which was dated 27 June 2007, that it was noted that an internal audit had pointed to some weaknesses in procurement and that the board had taken steps to address them.Since becoming aware of the issues in FÁS, I and my officials have been in constant contact with the organisation to ensure that it puts in place proper procedures to improve corporate governance.  In this regard I welcome both the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, as well as the publication of the committee's fourth interim report.The measures FÁS has implemented to improve financial control and governance across the organisation include the restructuring and tightening of controls in the corporate affairs function, which is at the centre of the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation; the implementation of a revised structure for its internal audit including resources for additional staff and external co-sourced audits; the commencement of a full audit of all procurement locations by FÁS internal audit, which is due for completion by the end of the year; the cancellation of all credit cards in FÁS with the exception of one used to purchase books and periodicals; and the cessation of the opportunities exhibitions and the reduction of the FÁS advertising budget to a minimum.I want to address the issue of the severance package awarded to the former director general of FÁS.  Mr. Molloy's severance package, which was negotiated to secure his departure from the post of director general, was broadly in line with the package he could have claimed under his employment contract had it been terminated by the board of FÁS.

I want to make it clear to the House that in regard to the issue of legal advice on the veracity of any possible legal action by Mr. Molloy, this did not arise as, although present, concern over legal action was not the deciding factor.

The Bill takes account of the recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts in its fourth interim report and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My main purpose in this Bill is to effect a number of amendments to the Labour Services Act 1987 in order to improve the effectiveness and governance of the board of FÁS and strengthen the accountability of its director general to the Oireachtas.  I propose to make the following amendments: to reduce the size of the board from 17 to 11 members; to change the composition of the board by providing that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may select its members, in consultation with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Education and Science——

My publication of this Bill sends a clear signal to the public, and to FÁS, that I want to restore public confidence in its ability to deliver on its training and employment mandate.Last month the live register fell by 16,500 persons.  This was a welcome development and was the first decrease in the live register figures since September 2008.  However, despite this decrease 423,600 persons remain on the register and the Government is committed to continuing to provide these individuals with the necessary assistance during this difficult period.On an on-going basis significant numbers of unemployed persons leave the live register.  From October 2008 to September 2009, 150,530 are recorded as leaving to employment.  This is a positive trend that shows there are still jobs available and that the Government activation measures are assisting the unemployed to develop their skills and secure employment.To respond to the increasing numbers of people on the live register, I am working closely with my colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Hanafin and Batt O'Keeffe, to ensure that appropriate responses are developed and put in place to meet the upskilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.  My Department alone is investing €1 billion in the provision of a range of labour force measures that will provide training and work experience opportunities to assist those who have lost their jobs.FÁS employment services, together with the local employment services, have put in place measures to double the capacity to cater for the rise in referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The implementation of these measures has increased the annual referral capacity to 147,000 persons this year.  These measures and others represent a significant step in meeting the considerable challenge of supporting the unemployed.In a difficult employment climate such as that which we currently face, the importance of training and education is vital for everyone within the workforce.  The impact such opportunities can have for those who are out of work and are seeking to rejoin the labour market, cannot be overstated.  To assist individuals through the provision of education and training opportunities, I have also almost doubled the number of activation training and work experience places provided by FÁS to over 130,000.  This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places which were available at the end of last year.Specifically, there are additional training places on short courses available to the unemployed.  This year my Department, through FÁS, will deliver approximately 92,000 short course training places to the unemployed, which is a quadrupling of the number of similar courses which were provided last year and reflects the Government's efforts in increasing relevant supports for the unemployed.In addition, in the supplementary budget the Government announced its intention to establish a programme that will provide valuable work experience to individuals who are unemployed and who have had limited experience to date.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and I jointly launched the work placement programme on 2 June.  The programme will provide 2,000 individuals who have been unemployed with a six-month work experience placement including graduates.Since the beginning of 2008 there has been a significant contraction in activity in the construction sector.  This contraction has been accompanied by a substantial reduction in the numbers of people employed within that sector.  This has had a severe impact on individuals who are currently undertaking an apprenticeship.  Unfortunately, at present there are 5,700 redundant apprentices who are seeking to complete their apprenticeships.  The Government is fully aware of the difficult situation in which these redundant apprentices find themselves and that is why it is committed to assisting redundant apprentices to gain employment as soon as possible in Ireland or abroad in order that these individuals may complete their apprenticeships.I have introduced a wide range of measures designed to help alleviate the present situation by enabling 3,800 redundant apprentices to progress their apprenticeships this year.  The measures include FÁS putting in place a measure whereby apprentices who are made redundant can progress to the next off-the-job training phase in the education sector.  This means that they do not need to do their on-the-job phase and can go directly to the next off-the-job phase.FÁS has also introduced an employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme to provide support for employers to provide on-the-job training to 500 redundant apprentices when they have released their employed apprentice to a scheduled phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training phase in the institutes of technology.  ESB Networks have agreed a programme with FÁS to provide on-the-job training to eligible redundant electrical apprentices at phase 5 and phase 7, and this programme will provide 400 places over a period of 18 months.  The institutes of technology are also providing an 11-week certified training programme for 700 redundant apprentices who have completed their phase 4 training but where another training opportunity is not currently available to them.As was already noted in the FÁS internal audit report INV 137, and confirmed by subsequent investigations by the Comptroller and Auditor General, primary responsibility for the procurement and promotional activity in question lay with corporate affairs section of FÁS.  I have already outlined in some detail to the House the changes that have been introduced into procedures within FÁS.The fact that there were problems in one area in FÁS does not in any way reflect the work of the majority of the staff in FÁS, who are hardworking and committed to their role in supporting those who avail of the training or employment activities of the organisation.  I acknowledge the excellent work carried out by them.  Their commitment and professionalism are crucial in helping to deal with key labour market challenges currently facing this country.The record shows that I responded quickly and effectively to the issues relating to FÁS as they presented themselves to me.  I have at all times worked to ensure that the FÁS organisation can refocus to address the key challenges of unemployment through its job search, training and employment programmes.

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I wish to share my time with Deputies McCormack and Varadkar.The motion tabled by Deputy Shortall and the Labour Party outlines many issues surrounding the operations of FÁS, particularly the reports that have been published by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  These reports have given rise to serious concerns among some but they have also given rise to outright rage among many as they outline the outrageous spending excesses at FÁS by a select few.FÁS is an agency working on the ground with people who find themselves unemployed and in need of training and education.  I agree that there is much good work done by that agency and many of its employees.  Those employees are disconcerted and disappointed with the outcome of the deliberations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the Committee of Public Accounts.FÁS is still responsible for spending of €1 billion per annum.  It is charged with carrying out an important function on behalf of the State, namely, training those who are unemployed.  It is needed now more than ever.  There are 430,000 people unemployed and in need of its services, yet FÁS is now under scrutiny in the media and in this House and the Committee of Public Accounts for its total failure to ensure that public moneys were spent appropriately and with due consideration and responsibility.  Instead, we have been subject to a litany of excesses — overspending, lack of adherence to procurement guidelines, and failure to account for spending and justify decisions that resulted in excess spending.  I recognise that the Comptroller and Auditor General is carrying out further investigations and we heard today about a prosecution in our courts.  However, we must remind ourselves that many of the outcomes we have heard so far are the result of an anonymous letter that was sent to the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who passed it to the chairman and the board of FÁS, resulting in the internal audit report INV 137.I acknowledge that the Tánaiste, who has left the House, has requested a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, the point being made in the motion before the House, with which I agree, is that two other Ministers were also responsible for overseeing the activities of FÁS, namely, the former Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputies Mary Harney and Micheál Martin, at the time these excesses which have now come to light were taking place.  Those Ministers and their accountability are also in question.Last week in the Committee of Public Accounts, the true size of the pension payment to Mr. Molloy was revealed.  The actuarial value of the pension is estimated to be €1.2 million, which is outrageous.  Ordinary people who have paid into their pensions and are now watching them go down the drain would never in their wildest dreams have hoped to contribute to a pension of that value.  However, it appears that a person who decided his position was no longer tenable and volunteered to resign found himself in a position to negotiate or was presented with a golden handshake.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  The whole episode smacks of certain people looking after one of their own rather than letting a person go because he had failed in his duty to oversee the spending of public money.  It would not happen in the private sector and it should not happen in the public sector.I am disappointed the legislation published today does not include a firm commitment to deal with issues such as this.  Guidelines are not good enough; we need legislation to ensure that public officials who have acted inappropriately and failed to live up to the commitment entailed in their employment can be let go or dismissed.  This did not happen in the case of Mr. Molloy, who was offered a golden handshake.  He had offered to resign and it seems he was doing everyone a favour by offering his head on a plate.  At that time FÁS was in the eye of the storm.  The internal audit report was before the Committee of Public Accounts, and Mr. Molloy had been on the radio that week defending the excesses in the area of foreign travel, which were not in keeping with Department of Finance guidelines.  He subsequently admitted the interview was a mistake and, within days, went to the then chairman of the board and offered his resignation.  Anyone who has read the transcript of the Committee of Public Accounts from last week will recall the long day described by Peter McLoone.  Mr. Molloy came to him before 8 a.m. and it was close to 8 p.m. when the deal was finally struck.It is extraordinary that there was no concept of the impact this inflated pension payment would have on the public.  People are outraged by it.  They cannot see why somebody who should have been dismissed and volunteered to resign was entitled to a golden handshake as if he was retiring after a long career in which he had excelled himself, when in fact he had failed to deal with breaches of guidelines, particularly in the corporate affairs unit of FÁS.  Throughout the saga that is unfolding we have had an alarming insight into the lack of control and oversight that existed.  Public procurement guidelines were ignored on a regular basis.  Anybody who has worked with a public body or local authority, as I have, will know that even when buying so much as a lawnmower, tenders must be sought.  However, individuals in FÁS gave themselves the freedom to breach these guidelines, to award lucrative contracts without seeking tenders and to ensure in some cases that those in the know were awarded contracts.There are serious questions with regard to the amount of money spent on advertising.  Between 2002 and 2008, €40 million was spent on advertising and related activities, including jobs fairs and activities to promote science.  This was at a time when we had full employment.  One of the sad outcomes of these excesses was mentioned in the opening statement of the director general of FÁS to the Committee of Public Accounts last week when he stated that advertising spending in FÁS was being reduced by 90% this year pending a strategic review by the organisation of a new communications and marketing strategy.  This is a time when FÁS and the service it offers are most needed.  Expenditure on foreign travel is to be reduced by 60%, and the science programme, which was mentioned by the Minister in her speech, has been cancelled.  This was the reason for much of the foreign travel and——

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	292	——junkets, and contributed to the excesses we have seen.  A total of €8.2 million was spent on the science programme, of which €3.5 million was spent on advertising.  This is a programme that was aimed purely at primary school students; yet somebody in FÁS deemed it worthwhile to spend €3.5 million on advertising, when a direct marketing programme to these primary school pupils would have been far more appropriate.  When we raised this with the current director general and the former chairman of FÁS last week, they had no answer.  It is obvious that nobody was overseeing this programme and there was no measure of its value.  We now have it from the Minister that it did not have any value.  It did not have any clear direction and did not contribute to increasing interest in and uptake of science, as it was intended to do.  The opportunities programme has been cancelled for 2009.  The chairman of the board, Mr. McLoone, resigned last week as he no longer had the confidence of the Minister.  I note that following last week's board meeting, other board members intend to stand down in an orderly fashion.The concerns of the Committee of Public Accounts have been acknowledged by the Minister.  It is hoped all the recommendations of its report will be implemented.  We await a report from the current director general of FÁS on how those recommendations have been implemented.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I found it most frustrating — the situation seemed farcical at the time — that when the committee requested information from FÁS, it was not available to us in many cases under the Data Protection Acts, yet that information was instantly available to the media under the Freedom of Information Act.  That is a direct contradiction and a recommendation in this regard has been included in the Committee of Public Accounts report.  This practice undermines the integrity of the committees of this House.  I believe the recommendation in this regard will be of value to all committees.The Tánaiste today published the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009.  I am disappointed to note that power to appoint members to a board is retained by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in conjunction with the Ministers for Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs.  Again, these decisions will be taken behind closed doors with no opportunity provided for the public, public representatives or Members of this House to question them and so on.Two weeks ago, Fine Gael put forward a Private Members' Bill, namely, the Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2008.  Deputy Leo Varadkar spoke on the Bill which would have been an important step in ensuring transparency in respect of appointments to public bodies such as FÁS, the HSE or the soon to be established NAMA.  There has been enormous growth during the past decade in the number of public bodies in this country.  Currently we have approximately 1,000 agencies across national and regional level.  Many people on those boards are doing a fine job.We proposed that any board in receipt of public funds of more than €1 million should be subject to the provisions of the Public Appointments Transparency Bill, that the names of appointees to such boards be put before the Houses and that the chairman would be invited to appear before the relevant committees of these Houses and given an opportunity to set out his or her credentials and ambitions for the job.  This was perceived as a witch hunt and it was stated that the private lives and concerns of these individuals would be torn apart in a public fashion.  However, that is not the case.  The Bill would have provided an opportunity for people to appear before a committee of these Houses and to state publicly their case in regard to how they believed the position to which they would be appointed could be fulfilled.  Disappointingly, the Bill was not accepted.  The publication today of the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 provides for more of the same in that appointments will be made behind closed doors, in a private fashion with no opportunity for public representatives to question them.It is important we ensure there is accountability in future and that guidelines are adhered to.  I am amazed that Department of Finance guidelines in regard to foreign travel and procurement were not adhered to.  The response to this has been a promise to review the current structure, to talk to individuals, to train people in procurement and how they should behave in an appropriate fashion, all of which should be standard.  Anyone dealing with public funds should realise the importance of the task involved.  When dealing with public funds, there should be a higher level of accountability than that which would pertain in the private sector.  The lack of adherence to procedures in FÁS and the riding roughshod over guidelines has been a shocking revelation to us all.  There is more to come.  Currently, 22 internal investigations are ongoing at FÁS.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is compiling a further report in this regard.  It is hoped that following this whole sorry saga we will have in place procedures and structures to ensure accountability at all levels and that those employed in State bodies behave in a responsible fashion and remain conscious of the fact that they are dealing with public funds for which they are accountable to the taxpayer through these Houses.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Labour Party motion which states that far too cosy a relationship was allowed to develop between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the agency it was supposed to be supervising.  The motion also condemns the failure of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her predecessors, Deputy Micheál Martin and Deputy Mary Harney in not exercising appropriate supervision of the agency to prevent wanton waste of taxpayers' money.As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have observed and followed closely the scandalous waste of taxpayers' money that took place urged on by the management structure of FÁS with the board, at the very least, turning a blind eye to what was going on.  The Tánaiste today published the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 which proposes to reduce the number of members on the board of FÁS.  However, this is a classic case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Not alone has the horse bolted, it must be a couple of miles down the road.  While the measures being taken now may be useful, the Tánaiste did not face up to her responsibilities when she presided over what happened at FÁS.While the management of FÁS flouted procedures and wasted money on travel, unnecessary advertising, junkets for management and board members, the board of FÁS appears to have been asleep on the job and should have resigned a year ago.  I am not following the trend of the past month or two in calling for the board of FÁS to resign.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 4 December 2008 I stated:I will ask the question rather than the Government.  Given that the board has been negligent in this issue, should it not consider its position?I put that question to the board at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 4 December 2008.  I also referred at that meeting to the travel issue and the responsibilities of the board in that regard.  I listened carefully this morning to Mr. McLoone's statement.  The words were well spoken but the board seemed not to accept any responsibility for any negligence regarding travel.  There was no provision for payment of travel expenses and Mr. McLoone said spending on travel was inappropriate but the board did not look at payments.In the Labour Services Act 1987, it states a member of staff of An Foras Forbatha, a predecessor of FÁS, other than the elected chairman or the staff of the subsidiary, shall be paid out of moneys at the disposal of An Foras Forbartha or the subsidiary as the case may be.  Such remuneration and allowances for expenses incurred by him and An Foras Forbartha or the subsidiary, as the case may be, will be paid with the consent of the Minister for Finance — the Minister for Finance had to consent to spending.  When that question was put to the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, in the Dáil, he said the Minister could not be expected to follow up every little detail, that it was the responsibility of the board.  Clearly, the board was negligent in looking after its responsibilities.I also asked Mr. McLoone if he realised when he was appointed chairman of the board that it was the responsibility of the board as set down by the Minister to approve of such payments, and he said "Yes", but the payments were not presented to him or for approval by the board.  There was a game of cat and mouse between management and the board at FÁS in not bringing the necessary information to the board and the board was negligent in not seeking that information which was necessary for them to carry out their duties as members of the board.After the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last year, Mr. Molloy went on "Today with Pat Kenny" to justify the extraordinary expenditure and waste of taxpayers' money in FÁS.  After that his position became untenable and he offered his resignation to the Minister.  Fast forward to the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and we discover that Mr. Molloy eventually resigned after being awarded an extraordinarily generous pension and a lump sum worth more than €1.1 million.The waters get very muddy here.  The impression given by the Secretary General of the Department, at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, was that Mr. Molloy had threatened litigation if he did not get the extraordinary deal.  This was not clearly spelled out but it was strongly hinted at.  That was the news story for the next few days and the media ran with it, that Mr. Molloy had put a gun to the Minister's head and would not resign unless he got this package.  The following Sunday, the Taoiseach stated that Mr. Molloy never threatened legal action.I do not know what happened.  I believe on the morning Mr. Molloy offered his resignation, the embattled Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment consulted the Taoiseach, as would be natural in this case, and I presume the Taoiseach told her to get the best deal possible for Mr. Molloy and they would see how things work out.  Once the Tánaiste went with that information to her officials, they were obliged to carry out the request of the Minister in arriving at the best deal.  Clearly the officials did not remove any benefits from Mr. Molloy in the deal they eventually worked out.At the end of the long day of negotiations, after Mr. Molloy had apparently offered his resignation in the morning, the deal was worked out and the Taoiseach had to be informed of it.  He was informed and signed off on it, and we are told the Minister for Finance gave his go ahead to the deal.  We are then told by the Green Party Ministers that they knew nothing about the deal.  It appears that three Cabinet members signed off on the deal.  If that is how the Government operates, it is a funny system.

I do not know what happens at Cabinet level, perhaps it is a matter of Cabinet confidentiality.  The Green Party Ministers, however, have stated clearly they were not aware of this deal.  They are aware of it now and seem to accept it as part of the price of staying in Government, they do not seem too concerned about it from what I can see.We have lately discovered that, on top of the generous settlement given to Mr. Molloy, he also drove off in a car.  Is this the same car exposed at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, the car that was purchased for a raffle, paid for and never delivered?  The committee could not establish where the car paid for out of public funds went or if it is indeed the car Mr. Molloy drove away in.  I would like to know, if it is possible at this stage to get a clear answer to anything that has happened at this level.There was collusion between the chief executive of FÁS and the board of directors, especially as they travelled abroad together at great expense to the State, where they all seemed to have a good time.  Most of them had bank cards they could use to charge up extraordinary amounts to FÁS during their deliberations abroad.  The science programme they were visiting has been cancelled, although I do not know why they were sending FÁS people to it.  Was the intention to send them into space?  I do not know what they were doing there, except having a good time at taxpayers' expense.It is extraordinary that at a time when there was practically full employment, we were spending €40 million on advertising and promotion of fairs, unnecessarily promoting FÁS when there was no need to spend such amounts on advertising.  FÁS had an annual budget of €1 billion from the taxpayer to run its affairs and it seems that coming to the end of each year, if the budget was not spent, someone invented another advertising campaign to waste another €500,000.  Some €600,000 was spent on a television advertisement that never appeared, a criminal waste of taxpayers' money.  The FÁS executive, to get another €1 billion, was justifying the expenditure of €1 billion the previous year, no matter how it was wasted.That amount has now been cut back, following the revelations from the Committee of Public Accounts.  I pay tribute to members of the committee from all parties in the way they have teased this out, at times getting this information from board members was like pulling teeth.  They diligently stuck to their task. This has given FÁS workers on the ground a bad name.  We must acknowledge that they have done great work on community schemes.  If they claim expenses, they must produce receipts for everything they buy, be it a spade, shovel or wheelbarrow.  If FÁS was run at the top in the same way, we would certainly have a better organisation.

This was a serious blow to the workforce and the town.  We have lost over 2,000 jobs in manufacturing industries in County Louth in recent years.  In Drogheda the famous Coca Cola factory closed, something we thought would be in place forever.  There is a really serious problem in the town.  The unemployment figure in the county stands at 16,562, and over 8,000 in Drogheda.  There are about 6,000 unemployed in Dundalk and about 2,300 in Ardee.Irish Cement announced this week that it is to cease production for a significant period to allow the economy to recover.  This will have a serious effect on those who work in that industry.  Workers are getting together in IFF.  They are fighting this by meeting the company and IDA Ireland.  I acknowledge the help the IDA has provided for both the workers and the company.  The workers have put together a document encompassing a significant offer to cut their wages and benefits which would deliver savings in excess of €5 million in the next three years.  Cost cutting measures already implemented this year will deliver a further €2 million in savings in the next three years.  Substantive but less readily identifiable changes to work practices are also being examined.  These will yield significant reductions in the cost of running the Drogheda operation in the coming years.  The company is due to respond to this document on Monday, 12 October, but time is running out.There are 95 people employed at the company in Drogheda, many of whom are in their early to mid-50s and too young to retire but too old to secure new jobs.  More worrying is the number of young people in the short service range who may find it difficult to find alternative employment for a significant period.  In the absence of any indication from the company that their jobs were in danger, many took on considerable financial burdens such as mortgages and so on in the past few years.  They are now very worried about their ability to service these commitments.Salaries and wages come to about €5.8 million annually, while locally sourced services and supplies bring €4.7 million into the local economy.  Therefore, this industry accounts for a figure of €10.5 million locally; therefore, it is very important.  On the cost to the State, the estimated cost to the redundancy fund is €1.1 million, the estimated social welfare costs in the first year are €1.85 million, while the total loss to the Exchequer in PAYE and PRSI contributions will be €5.2 million.  If the factory closes, the actual cost to the taxpayer will be €8.2 million, something nobody in IFF or Drogheda can accept.We want constructive dialogue with the Minister and IDA Ireland.  We welcome the support the IDA is giving to the workers and the fact that the county manager, the mayor and local community are coming together.  There is still time to save the company.  It is not closing tomorrow, as the deadline is September 2010.  We await the Minister's reply with concern.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Tánaiste sends her apologies.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the circumstances.I am acutely aware of the consequences of the proposal to close the Irish Flavours and Fragrances facility in Drogheda, County Louth.  If implemented, the proposal would result in 103 job losses.  IDA Ireland is directly engaged with IFF on the matter and has put a proposal to the company which it hopes it will consider.  FÁS has also been in contact with IFF to offer assistance. The aim of both agencies is to explore options with IFF which would avoid or alleviate the threatened redundancies.  I have asked the IDA to bring local concerns and the concerns of local representatives to the attention of IFF Corporate and use its best endeavours to minimise the impact of a final decision.  The IDA believes the Drogheda plant was highly regarded within the overall group.  The proposal to close the plant is based on a corporate desire to centralise all manufacturing of fine fragrance products — the segment in which Drogheda is involved — in one location in Europe.Aside from the IFF situation, IDA Ireland is actively marketing County Louth as a location for industrial development.  This year there was a robust programme of site visits to assess the county for investment, from which it is hoped some significant wins will result.  The IDA has two very significant site portfolios in County Louth, with business parks in Dundalk and Drogheda.  It has secured planning permission for two biopharma facilities in the Dundalk science and technology park.  These will be used to aggressively market the county in what is now one of the most significant sectors globally.On a broader policy level, the Government has been responding to the economic downturn and taken numerous initiatives which will benefit regions affected by or threatened with job losses.  In particular, the Tánaiste and her Ministers of State have been closely involved in promoting measures to improve competitiveness, stabilise industrial employment and output, and strengthen labour market activation policies.  Cost competitiveness is a key factor in determining a location for business.  It is important, therefore, that we achieve greater cost competitiveness in Ireland.  For most exporting firms, labour costs account for more than half their input costs.  We have recently seen a 7% competitiveness gain in unit labour costs.  Although it is a painful adjustment, a reduction in unit labour costs, delivered through pay reform, will strengthen our longer term competitiveness.  The European Union estimates that Irish unit labour costs will fall by 4% this year, compared with a 3% increase in the Union on average, translating into a significant improvement in competitiveness.There has also been downward movement in energy prices.  In May this year there was an average 10% drop in electricity prices for residents and small and medium enterprises, while gas prices were reduced by an average of 12%.  The CER recently announced that it would hold down prices for large energy users.  In early September it announced a 0.4% decrease for small businesses and a more significant 5.5% decrease for medium-sized enterprises from October.Both the NCB manufacturing and services purchasing managers' indices are showing a sustained period of decline in input costs for businesses in Ireland.  The decline in Irish inflation reached -5.9% in the year to July, the sharpest fall since the early 1930s.  Property and land prices are also falling, which is an advantage in terms of lower rents or property costs in the attraction of new FDI projects and also for indigenous businesses seeking to set up or expand.  The OECD has predicted mild deflation in Ireland for the next two years.  This will maintain the current downward pressure on wages and prices.The National Competitiveness Council published its annual competitiveness report in August.  The report states we retain a wide range of competitive strengths.  These include a young and well educated workforce, growing levels of research and development activity, a modern internationally trading enterprise base and a long track record as a successful location for overseas investors.  However, we must redouble our efforts to ensure the economy becomes more competitive in order that Ireland will be in a position to benefit from a global recovery when it emerges.  In fact, there are some indications that the global downturn has reversed.  The price of oil has gone up in the past few days and there is now an acknowledgment that the world may have come out of the current downward spiral, particularly those nations in the G20.  For example, Australia raised its interest rates today, which is an indication that some economies are reaching a plateau and coming out of the recession.  As an open trading economy we are vulnerable to downward trends, but equally there are opportunities in upward trends.  Hopefully, we will see these opportunities over the next period.  This hope is being lived up to in the increase in exports.  I understand the concerns the Deputy raised in the context of the IFF workers.  We will urge the IDA to engage with the company to address the issues and see what supports can be brought forward to address the concerns of the Deputy and the workers.

This is a fine community hospital that has served the people of west Limerick over many years.  St. Ita's covers west Limerick and St. Camillus's covers east Limerick.  St. Ita's is a little remote from the main centre of medical attention, Limerick Regional Hospital, and has experienced difficulty with regard to cover over the past number of months.  This puts the consultant geriatrician in a very difficult position, because he must now decide what category of patient to place in the fine rehabilitation unit in Newcastle West.  He must be extremely careful because of the risk involved.  I understand the families of the patients going there now have to sign a disclaimer.  It is not right that this should happen because we lack medical cover and have no extra facility.The situation is that people are transferred to St. Ita's having been acutely ill in Limerick Regional Hospital.  Approximately 350 patients per year are transferred to the acute rehabilitation unit in the Newcastle West hospital and as a result no bed is being blocked in the Limerick Regional Hospital.  What reward do we get from the HSE for this?  We get no reward or credit but only suffer a lack in medical cover.  As a result, the risk is increasing all the time.  I appeal to the HSE to try to ensure when allocating resources that we save this unit.I do not want to use threatening language or frighten people about the future of the unit, but we must stand up and demand the necessary, additional medical resources required.  We must stand up and fight for the provision of a basic extra facility, rather than wrap elderly patients in a blanket in the middle of the night, throw them into an ambulance and transfer them 25 miles to Limerick Regional Hospital.  That should not happen.  Just a small amount of resources would go a long way towards ensuring we can maintain this fantastic service for the elderly people of west Limerick.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene with the HSE to try to ensure we arrive at a solution.We are doing all the right things.  I sat on the health board with the Acting Chairman for many years, where we raised the case because we felt we were coming from a low base.  We did not have the required level of consultants or staff in our hospital, but we always did the right thing and brought our budget in on time.  But for the good graces of the people involved in St. Ita's hospital, the geriatrician David Clynch, the matron, Eileen O'Connor, Sr. Eileen Crowley who heads the rehabilitative unit and all the nursing staff and others there, the unit would not be operating now.  Their efforts should be acknowledged and the necessary supports put in place.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I fully agree that an excellent service is provided by the acute rehabilitation unit in St. Ita's hospital.  This service induces efficiency in the mid-west regional hospital by ensuring the level of beds available for the elderly in that hospital is accommodated by the service from the acute rehabilitation unit of St. Ita's in Newcastle West.  This is now under threat.  A reduction in the number of senior house officers means a lack of medical facilities which creates a difficulty for the service and for Dr. David Clynch and his support team and for transferring patients to the acute rehabilitation unit.It is wrong that somebody should have to sign a disclaimer in order to receive this excellent service in Newcastle West.  It is also unacceptable that people in the hinterland of Newcastle West, which includes most of my constituency, will now not have the services of the rehabilitation unit available locally.  I have personal experience of a member of my family being in that unit and of the excellent service it provided in allowing people return to their communities as a result of rehabilitation without which they would have had to go into long-term care.The absence of the required medical cover will create a situation in the medium term where this facility will probably be discontinued.  This is not acceptable to us.  Not providing the cover is false accounting because closing the unit will cost the HSE more in resources than keeping it open.  Patient treatment in the mid-west will also cost more.  Some 350 patients are transferred to the unit each year.  We want to retain this excellent service and call on the Minister and HSE to ensure we do.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who is unable to attend.  I am taking the debate in her place.  I thank Deputies Cregan and Neville for raising this issue.  It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter and to outline the background to the current situation and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.As Deputies are aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care, where this is appropriate.  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including facilities such as the rehabilitation unit at St. Ita's community hospital.St. Ita's hospital was built in 1841 and certain developments have taken place there over the years, including the provision of the rehabilitation unit which opened in 1992.  This was as an eight-bed inpatient unit which also provided day hospital services three days a week.  The medical needs of the rehabilitation unit were provided for under the leadership of a consultant geriatrician.  In 2001, in response to increasing needs, the service was expanded to include 14 acute rehabilitation beds.  The outpatient services are provided through a day hospital, the medical clinic and therapy services.Early in 2008, a number of perceived risks at St. Ita's hospital were raised with the Department, including the question of 24-hour medical cover.  On foot of this approach, the Department requested a report from the Health Service Executive on the services provided at St. Ita's.  Consequently, an assessment of risks in St. Ita's has been completed and a risk register is being prepared which will incorporate an implementation plan.The Health Service Executive's national service developments for older people, 2008, identified the need for four consultant-led community geriatrician teams, one team per HSE administrative area.  The team for the HSE west is based in Limerick and will incorporate two medical posts, one consultant and one specialist registrar.  The medical posts will allow for some additional medical cover to be provided to St. Ita's hospital by the full medical team in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  The Health Service Executive has advised that interviews for the community consultant geriatrician recently took place.  Appointments will take place on a "joint appointment" basis to both the acute and primary, community and continuing care, PCCC,  service.   It is envisaged that strong clinical links between the hospital and community will continue to be developed and this will enable care to be streamlined to best meet the needs of the individual.In addition, I understand that detailed discussions have taken place between relevant staff of the Health Service Executive and the hospital with regard to addressing the particular issue of service provision.  The capacity of the executive to provide approved levels of services continues to be reviewed in the context of overall resources available. It is incumbent on each local health manager to ensure that services, including rehabilitation services such as at St. Ita's, are delivered within allocated budgets.  This includes any decision on prioritising and providing additional rehabilitation cover at this particular location.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources.The Government is committed to the development of comprehensive rehabilitation services across the country.  As I have outlined to the House, the Department of Health and Children will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to advance this objective.  This includes any decision on prioritising and providing additional rehabilitation cover at this location.  It requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources.The Government is clearly committed to the development of comprehensive rehabilitation services across the country and I have outlined to the House that the Department of Health and Children will continue to work with the HSE to advance this objective.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	306	There are glaring deficiencies in the provision of dermatology services in the south east.  The appalling situation at present is that one consultant dermatologist is single-handedly providing a service for a population 460,000 people.  Comhairle na nOspidéal having consulted the literature relating to dermatology service provision in the UK, North America and Australia published a report in November 2003 recommending that there should be one dermatologist per 100,000 population.  The greater Dublin area has the lion's share of consultant dermatologists.  The south east which has the largest population outside Dublin remains the only region with only one consultant dermatologist.Clinics are provided in Waterford Regional Hospital, Wexford General Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital Kilkenny.  There are more than 3,500 patients waiting two to three years for a routine hospital appointment in the south east.  While it is likely that this list will be somewhat reduced if validated, there are long lists for routine problems and patients are suffering.  There is a weekly paediatric dermatology clinic with a current waiting list of six months.Some general practitioners on the periphery of the region refer their patients to Cork Limerick and Dublin.  These centres increasingly refuse to accept referrals from outside their regions which adds to the pressure on the inadequate provision in the south east region.  Ever increasing incidents of all forms of skin cancer take up a considerable amount of time at the department.  The dermatology department in Waterford is small and inadequate, with one consultant dermatologist, one specialist trainee registrar, a specialist nurse and two nurses, who job share.  The department removes approximately 700 cancers annually.  The department runs a pigmented liaison mole clinic for the early detection of melanoma and provides a mole mapping service.There is also a multi-disciplinary head and neck skin cancer clinic run in conjunction with the local ophthalmic plastic surgeon and an eye and ear surgeon, all of which generate surgical activity.  Waterford is one of the few centres in the 26 counties which provides photodynamic therapy, a non-invasive treatment of superficial skin cancers.This all amounts to a work load that is way too much for one consultant dermatologist.  Added to this is the fact that no suitable locum dermatologist has been available in recent years to provide cover for the annual and study leave of the consultant dermatologist in Waterford.Skin disease impacts on quality of life, interpersonal relationships and even job prospects.  For the past 12 years this situation in Waterford and the south east has been ignored.  This appalling situation cannot be allowed to continue and requires immediate and decisive corrective action.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children to take urgent action to ensure that there are additional dermatologists and back-up teams appointed forthwith to the south east region within the HSE south, with the appropriate required accommodation.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I am again taking this item on the Adjournment Debate on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services, delivered efficiently and effectively.  Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.Dermatology is the medical specialty caring for illness predominately relating to the skin, hair and nails.  It is mainly an out-patient/day care activity with a small in-patient requirement.  The HSE recognises that dermatology services in the HSE south east region require further development.  The proposed development of services is in line with the main principles and key recommendations as identified by the Comhairle na nOspidéal report of the committee on dermatology services published in November 2003.Among the main principles of the Comhairle approach are an equitable and patient centred service regional self-sufficiency and collaboration between primary and secondary care.   At present there is one consultant dermatologist working in the south east region.  The dermatology service includes in-patient care where required; day cases and out-patient consultations.  Outreach clinics are provided in Wexford, Kilkenny and Clonmel.  In Waterford Regional Hospital, the dermatology services include a range facilities including out-patient clinics, cryotherapy, minor surgery and nurse-led phototherapy services.The HSE has identified the provision of a second consultant dermatology post among its priorities for development.  This year the Minister allocated funding to the HSE for demographic service pressures, and the Executive decided to prioritise posts in vascular surgery and orthopaedics in the south east.  These posts were approved and are now being progressed.The HSE is faced with difficult choices in delivering its services within the resources available.  It will continue to keep the scope for further developments in dermatology services under consideration bearing in mind the funds it has available.  In line with the national service plan 2009 and its transformation programme, the HSE will review the current configuration of acute hospital services in the south east.  A steering group is developing a plan for hospital reconfiguration.This plan will seek to deliver optimal and cost effective services that are easily and readily accessible and that are delivered through centres of excellence.  All hospitals in the south eastern hospital group are included in the plan for the revised model.  The review, which includes a broad-based consultation within the services, is likely to be completed in 2010.  Decisions on the services of any individual hospital will be taken following its completion.It is within the context of this review that any expansion of the dermatology services in the south east will be considered.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley say how such blatant inconsistencies can exist in An Bord Pleanála's decision making when it comes to Tetra mast applications on Eircom sites?An Bord Pleanála is appointed by the Minister, yet is not accountable to anybody.  I cannot understand for the life of me why.  If it is appointed by a Minister one would expect that it should be accountable to somebody, especially the particular Minister.  For example, eight out of eight planning applications that were refused by Kerry County Council were upheld by An Bord Pleanála because, in Kerry a "1 km rule" was introduced, during my time in local government, to the effect that telecommunications masts could not be located within 1 km of a residential area or a hospital or school.  Some seven out of eight planning applications that were refused by Cork County Council were overturned by An Bord Pleanála, so there are stark inconsistencies there.  How can these statistics be acceptable or justified and why is it that County Cork's amenities and citizens appear to be more worthy of protection than County Kerry's?  That is not acceptable.While nobody denies the needs for such a service as Tetra's, it is the irresponsibility in choosing locations for the masts that I find unacceptable.  In the Cork areas An Bord Pleanála cited "proximity to residential buildings, proximity to protected structures, proximity to schools and community properties" as reasons to refuse planning for these masts.  This does not seem to be a problem for An Bord Pleanála in some of the Kerry cases, however, particularly as regards the Annascaul mast site which is merely 30 metres from the nearest permanently occupied residence.  The nearest occupied building, which houses a small business, is only 26 metres from the site.  There are approximately ten occupied residences, and a protected structure within 50 metres of the site.  There is another protected structure within 90 m and a further two within 420 m of the site, as well as a school within 570 m.  The whole nucleus of the village is based within 800 m of the site, which is in the centre of the village.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's guidelines on telecommunications masts and support structures of 1996 state that only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should freestanding masts be located in a residential area or beside schools.  In the Annascaul case, An Bord Pleanála's senior inspector strongly recommended against granting planning permission on the grounds that all other alternative sites had not been fully investigated.  It is clear they have not been fully investigated because the people of the community were contacted recently by Tetra Ireland in order for the people themselves to come up with a more suitable site.  That is not their job.The siting of the mast in Annascaul would be seriously damaging to the surrounding amenities and properties yet the board itself overruled the inspector's findings.  3 Ireland, which is the company contracted by Tetra Ireland to acquire the site, has stated that as a priority it targets the Eircom exchanges first when choosing a site.  This in itself proves that these sites are not being chosen as a last resort, as stated in and required by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's 1996 guidelines.  These decisions by An Bord Pleanála appear to flout the guidelines set down by the Department and have left small communities like Annascaul to fend for themselves against big businesses like Eircom and Tetra.The Annascaul community has now entered its first week of a 24-hour protest outside the site and they will not give it up.  I suggest that the Minister would get involved and intervene in this case.  These people are not going to lie down because, as I have said, Kerry people will not lie down.  I call on the Minister to personally intervene in this case before it goes too far.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	309	As the Deputy is from Kerry and I am a Cork Deputy, I am well aware of the fact Kerry people do not lie down.  I wish they would lie down more often in Croke Park, but that does not happen.  However, not to trivialise the issue, I understand the Deputy's point and thank him for raising the matter.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for being unable to take this debate, which he has asked me to take on his behalf.Under planning legislation, the decision to grant a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority in the first instance or An Bord Pleanála on appeal.  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's 1996 guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures set out a locational hierarchy in regard to the siting of radio masts and advise that free-standing masts should only be located within or in the immediate surrounds of smaller towns or villages as a last resort.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	310	That is correct.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	311	However, the guidelines also note that the Government's telecommunications policy aims to place Ireland in the top quartile of OECD economies as regards availability, price and quality of telecommunications services.  They also state that planning authority development plans should include a policy statement in regard to telecommunications which accepts the importance of a high quality telecommunications service.I understand that the proposed development in this case consists of the construction of a 15 m support pole to carry three radio aerials for use by the emergency services, namely, Garda, ambulance and fire brigade, together with associated equipment for a new national digital radio service, at Eircom Exchange, Ardrinnane, Annascaul, County Kerry.  The Minister has been informed that Kerry County Council refused permission in accordance with section 12.16.11 of the county development plan, which states that telecommunication masts should not be located within 1 km of residential properties, schools, hospitals or any structures where there is human occupancy for residential or daily work purposes.  However, he understands that in granting permission on appeal, An Bord Pleanála considered, having regard to the location of the proposed development within the village, its height and the surrounding pattern of development, that the proposed development would not seriously injure the amenities of the area, or of property in the vicinity; would not be prejudicial to public health and would, therefore, be in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.The board also attached a condition to the permission that after ten years telecommunications structure and related ancillary structures would be removed unless, prior to the end of the period, planning permission should have been granted for their retention for a further period.

The finalised Strategy includes an action to "implement random road side drug testing as soon as this is technically and legally possible", with the Department of Transport as lead agency for this action.I understand that, at this stage, there is no feasible basis yet in Europe for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs. Testing devices are still in the prototype stages. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, is keeping abreast of developments in this area. My colleague, Noel Dempsey T.D., Minister for Transport will be guided by the Bureau as to when a roadside test suitable for use here becomes available and can be introduced.

In recent Budgets we have considered a range of measures to maintain a prudent fiscal outturn for 2009 and to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation. Across Government, our approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.In relation to the various programme areas in my Department that support rural development, efforts have been made to minimise the effects on frontline services, where possible. This approach will continue in the context of the ongoing financial management of my Department's Vote for the remainder of the year.While funding for some programmes operated by my Department has been reduced, it is important to note that there will still be significant expenditure this year across a number of schemes.  In particular, I should mention the very substantial investment in our rural areas now being made under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  This Programme includes investment of €425m, which is 55% co-funded by the EU, towards improving the quality of life in rural areas and diversifying the rural economy.

In line with previous commitments, the review has been completed and a draft report is being prepared.Pending consideration of the review and the putting in place of revised arrangements for 2010, I have agreed to lift the suspension.  Community and voluntary organisations participating in the Scheme in recent years have been notified and have been advised of the conditions attaching to the reopening of the Scheme.Since my Department took over responsibility for the Scheme in 2002 some 62,000 recipients have benefited from support under the Scheme.  Expenditure under the Scheme is estimated to be in excess of €20m for the period 2002-2009.  All applications on hand at the time of suspension of the Scheme in April have been dealt with.  Some €1.28m has been paid to 214 groups to date in 2009 with 3,695 older people receiving grants for equipment under the Scheme.

Such figures, focusing on treatment data, do not provide accurate estimates of the prevalence of drug use.  Indeed, increased treatment numbers are generally to be welcomed.Our best estimates in regard to prevalence are those found in the two all island Prevalence Surveys undertaken in 2002/2003 and 2006/07, with the next such survey to be undertaken in 2010/2011.  Indeed, the Alcohol and Drug Research Unit attribute the increased numbers in cocaine and opiate treatment to a combination of factors, an increase in the number of treatment places, an increase in reporting to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, as well as increased drug use.A recent report into young people involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour indicates that many of the incidents involved were alcohol related.  Evidence indicates a well recognised link between alcohol consumption among young people and their engagement in the committal of offences.  Significant services are available that seek to address the risk factors that influence the early onset of substance use among young people and to promote protective factors, as well as addressing problem alcohol and drug use when they arise.The further development of prevention measures aimed primarily at those deemed to be most at risk of becoming involved in illegal drug use, and at the younger adult population generally, is a crucial element of the recently published National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  Such interventions will cover both school and non-school settings, recognising in particular the dangers that arise in the case of early school leavers.  Along with this, there will be an increased emphasis on developing awareness among the general population with respect to problem drug and alcohol use.Last March the Government decided to include alcohol with drugs in a National Substance Misuse Strategy that will be developed by the end of next year.  I welcome this and I see it facilitating a more coherent approach to the overall problem of substance misuse, particularly among young people.

Since its establishment in May 2003 to the end of August 2009, the net transfers to the DAF have totalled some €334.1m.The value of the Fund at the end of August 2009, net of liabilities, was some €49.1m. This excludes the amount of some €48.6m currently maintained in a Reserve Account to meet reclaims and to cover expenses.  The reserve is currently set at 15% of the total moneys received by the Fund and not yet reclaimed.The geographical spread of the applications received for funding under each round is set out in Table I.  Furthermore, the Cabinet approved €1,864,228 for 90 drug related projects, which are regionally based, set out in Table II.Of the 9,393 applications received to date, 9,246 applications have been assessed with 6,509 or 70% of these recommended for funding.  The number of applications not recommended or deemed ineligible for funding to date has amounted to 2,737 or 30% of assessed applications.  In addition, the Government agreed to provide €64.4m to support the Rural Social Scheme between the years 2004 and 2008.  No specific allocations were made to areas of the State given the national coverage of the programme.  The Government approved a further €10m to support an Early Childhood Initiative based in three projects in Tallaght West in Dublin South and Ballymun, Darndale, Moatview and Belcamp on Dublin's Northside.Following consideration and decision by the Government, all applicants are notified of the outcome of their application.  The Deputy will appreciate that the number of approvals under each measure are made having regard to the resources available and the quality of applications received.   Given the nature of the application, assessment and approval processes, the issue of waiting lists does not arise.CountyRound 1 — 2004/05Round 2 — 2006Round 3 — 2007Round 4 — 2008TotalCarlow1649449118Cavan7497518149Clare2498589189Cork181245353119898Donegal5722020025502Dublin5609107505332,753Galway11122319080604Kerry6816213120381Kildare21845423182Kilkenny31845212179Laois1337482100Leitrim2740406113Limerick5716312276418Longford32272819106Louth36657247220Mayo4515415710366Meath5918328207Monaghan876485137Offaly742572108Roscommon38704510163Sligo53875815213Tipperary5410910843314Waterford601329320305Westmeath23666322174Wexford331029247274Wicklow34759416219UK1———1Total all Counties1,6023,4603,1151,2169,393Dial to Stop Drug InitiativeTask ForceAreaTotal Grant€East Coast RDTFEast County Wicklow, Arklow, South Dublin City — Dublin 2, 4, 14, 1830,000Midlands RDTFLongford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois30,000Mid West RDTFClare, Limerick and South Tipperary30,000North Dublin City & County RDTFNorth County Dublin — Ashbourne, Swords, Balbriggan, Donabate30,000South East RDTFWexford, Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow, South Tipperary30,000Southern RDTFCounty Cork & County Kerry30,000Bray LDTFBray Town30,000Cork City LDTFCork City30,000Dun Laoghaire LDTFDun Laoghaire30,000Finglas Cabra LDTFDublin 7, Dublin 1130,000Total300,000Task ForceAreaTotal Grant€East Coast Area RDTFJoint Family Support Initiative — Bara Project45,281East Coast Area RDTFGreystones Ecumenical Group1,000North Dublin City & County RDTFSwords Family Support Group8,400North Dublin City & County RDTFCAD/CIC Training programme29,600South-Western Area RDTFKildare West Wicklow CAT/Abbey project35,000South-Western Area RDTFCuan Mhuire19,300South-Western Area RDTFKildare Community Education Partnership9,400Midlands RDTFAshdale/ Woodlands Grove Residents Association500Midlands RDTFEdenderry Addressing Substance Abuse — EASA43,540Midlands RDTFHarmony Community Development Project10,000Midlands RDTFNational Association for Parent Support4,960Midlands RDTFLongford Acorn Project8,500Midlands RDTFMidland Regional Youth Service5,000Midlands RDTFArden View Community & Family Resource Centre2,500Mid-West RDTFTipp Regional Youth Service20,000Mid-West RDTFSouthhill Family Resource Centre9,550Mid-West RDTFBushypark Treatment Centre44,920North-Eastern RDTFNorth East Family Support Network70,000North-Western RDTFLetterkenny CDP10,140North-Western RDTFNorth West Alcohol Forum30,000North-Western RDTFMoville & District Family Resource Centre9,785North-Western RDTFTubbercurry Family Resource Centre10,000North-Western RDTFBallymote Family Resource Centre12,000North-Western RDTFDunfanaghy Community & Family Resource Centre5,000Southern RDTFListowel Family Resource Centre10,800Southern RDTFCobh Community Drugs Initiative7,200Southern RDTFTabor Lodge67,000Southern RDTFMatt Talbot Adolescent Service44,966South East RDTFSouth East Region Family Support Network41,748South East RDTFKilkenny Family Support Group3,680South East RDTFWaterford CBDI3,000South East RDTFYou are Not Alone Family Support Group3,355South East RDTFAislinn Family Support15,000South East RDTFSuir Valley CBDI3,250Western RDTFStrengthening Families Programme (SFP65,450Ballyfermot LDTFBallyfermot STAR41,700Ballyfermot LDTFFamiliscope30,000Ballymun LDTFStar Ballymun35,000Ballymun LDTFBallymun Youth Action Project10,000Blanchardstown LDTFBlanchardstown LDTF43,355Blanchardstown LDTFCoolmine Therapeutic Community10,000Blanchardstown LDTFSibling Support Programme8,000Canal CommunitiesCanal Communities Task Force70,000Clondalkin LDTFFamilies First Team35,000Clondalkin LDTFCUMAS7,140Cork City LDTFGurranabraher/Churchfield CLDTF Community Project — Parents Support Group7,680Cork City LDTFCork Gay Community Dev Co.

Following bilateral discussions with Foras na Gaeilge, however, the company decided to decline the offer and consequently a further competition is in train at the present time.Given these circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in the employment issue he raises.

I am advised that OPW is continuing to examine the property in question to ascertain its suitability. As stated by me in previous replies, I should emphasise that this is a sensible and prudent response to the approach that has been made and implies no decision.

The outputs achieved by Údarás are reported on annually and those reports are laid before the Oireachtas.It may be noted that Údarás was a participant with the State's other industrial development agencies in the Inter-Agency Group to Review VFM Indicators. Furthermore, with specific regard to capital expenditure, the organisation is subject to the Department of Finance's Capital Appraisal Guidelines, which require, inter alia, that business cases and post-project reviews be carried out in order to ensure VFM.It should be noted also that the statutory remit of Údarás relates, not only to economic development, but also to a wider framework encompassing the linguistic and cultural development of the Gaeltacht. Clearly, any assessment of the delivery of VFM outcomes for Údarás must have regard to these different facets of the organisation's statutory remit.Finally, I can confirm that Údarás has been subject to periodic VFM reviews and that its work is kept under active review by my Department.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 824 and 826 to 830, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department implements and funds a broad range of measures and programmes covering the areas addressed by the Deputy in his questions.  In the context of the current economic climate, my primary concern has been and will continue to be the protection of front line services delivering vital programmes and initiatives, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities, whether they be urban or rural.  This should minimise negative consequences of funding reductions.As I outlined in my response to Parliamentary Questions 38, 44 and 135 of the 17th June 2009, which were answered together, the revised 2009 allocation for my Department shows a gross reduction of  €47.4m on the initial estimated allocation announced in October 2008.  Full details of the reductions at an individual programme level are available in the Revised Estimates Volume 2009, which is available on-line on the website of the Department of Finance  (http://www.finance.gov.ie/ViewDoc.asp?DocId=-1&CatID=13&m=f).Against this background, no area is immune to cost cutting measures in the current economic environment.  It is in this context that reduced budget allocations have been made to certain measures and programmes. I appreciate that this involves some difficult choices having to be made.  I am acutely aware of the concerns of community and rural groups in this regard and it is why I have responded by placing such emphasis on the protection and prioritisation of front line services and support to customers/beneficiaries over administration, overheads and ancillary costs.Both I, the Minister of State, and our officials are in regular and ongoing  contact with the community and voluntary sector on the issues raised by the Deputy and are aware of their concerns. We will do what we can to address those concerns within the broader public policy and budgetary context.The Deputy will be aware that across Government as a whole, we are taking a number of difficult decisions, but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible. Although funding for some programmes operated by my Department has been curtailed or suspended, I still expect that a sufficient spend will be made in order to ensure continued positive impact across community, rural and voluntary sectors.If the Deputy has a specific question about a particular programme, scheme, project, group or organisation I will be happy to deal with that.

However, my Department operates a range of initiatives, schemes and programmes that support the growth of business and enterprise.  Relevant schemes include the 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme (RDP), the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP), the CLÁR programme, the Community Services Programme, and Rural Recreation schemes.My Department is responsible for the implementation of the LEADER elements of the 2007-2013 RDP.  A key objective of the programme focuses on the diversification of the rural economy and specifically provides €48.26m to support micro-enterprises.  This funding will complement the supports provided by the County Enterprise Boards and will focus, in particular, on the development of indigenous rural resources in artisan food, forestry, marine, rural/agri-tourism, cultural heritage and community promoted enterprises; the development of recreational tourism and other complementary tourism supports and environmentally friendly initiatives. Axis 3 and Axis 4 (LEADER) of the RDP commenced in February 2009 and there are currently project commitments totalling €4.8 million registered under the Business Creation and Development measure.My Department's LDSIP provides for integrated approaches to identify, nurture and support individuals, groups and communities in accessing suitable and sustainable employment and self-employment options. Types of activity supported include: proactive outreach and targeted supports such as complementary education and training, support with work placement, support into self-employment or enterprise, and community enterprise activities.Enterprise support is a feature of the LDSIP and is differentiated from mainstream enterprise initiatives by its focus on disadvantage and on supporting the individual into self-employment or enterprise through training and education, mentoring, networking and after-care as well as small grants towards start-up.In addition to the above, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the work of Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission (WDC), which are agencies under the aegis of my Department.Údarás na Gaeltachta is working to reverse the downward employment trend in the Gaeltacht and effect the transition from a declining manufacturing sector to employment in services, including Irish-language centred employment.To assist in the current economic climate, an tÚdarás is administering in the Gaeltacht the new Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which have been established to address the needs of vulnerable small to medium enterprises.My Department also operates, in conjunction with the relevant County Enterprise Boards, an Enterprise Scheme for the non-Gaeltacht Islands, the aim of which is to encourage the development of both new and existing micro-enterprises on islands outside the Gaeltacht.  The introduction of this scheme, which complements the enterprise supports provided by Údaras na Gaeltachta on Gaeltacht islands, recognises the higher costs and locational disadvantage involved in running an island-based business.I have allocated some €47m to projects approved under the Community Services Programme.  I hope that by the end of 2009, over 450 projects will be operational and employing 2,700 people.

At our most recent meeting on 27 July 2009, we discussed progress by the organisation to date in 2009.As the Deputies will be aware, Waterways Ireland has made considerable progress in recent years. During 2008, the ongoing upgrading of the waterways saw a total of 581 metres of additional moorings completed, with the maintenance programme keeping 95% of all navigable waterways open, as planned, for recreational activity.  Maintenance projects included:continuance of the dredging programme on the Grand Canal to restore the canal to its navigable depth;the completion of dredging on 3,200 metres of the Barrow line between Vicarstown and Courtwood in Co. Laois and on a further 1,300 metres of the Main Line dredged between Plunkett and Derries Bridges adjacent to Pollagh Co. Offaly; andthe upgrading of stone jetties on the Barrow navigation, with 300 metres of bank protection works and trackway widening between Carlow and Bestfield Lock and the installation of new lock gates.Achievements this year on the development of the waterways include:completion of 79 metres of additional moorings;completion of the construction of the final bridge at Lyneen to reconnect the Royal Canal to the Shannon; andprogress on the restoration of the Ulster Canal with the preliminary stages of the design process well underway.I also had preliminary discussions with the Chief Executive regarding Waterways Ireland's proposed capital programme and financial provision for 2010.  The precise scale of works to be carried out in 2010 to improve services and facilities along the navigation and the associated funding to be made available will be set out in Waterway's Ireland's Business Plan for 2010, which is currently being prepared, and which will be submitted for approval to the North/South Ministerial Council in due course.

Its primary role will be to co-ordinate and oversee the delivery of the new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.Thirteen people are currently working in the OMD. In addition, officers at Assistant Principal level (or equivalent) are being assigned to the OMD on a half-time basis from various statutory organisations.  Funding is also provided to support the active participation of the community and voluntary sectors with the Office and protocols in this regard are currently being finalised.Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces, report to me in relation to implementation of the National Drugs Strategy, as Minister of State with responsibility in that regard.  A Drugs Advisory Group has been established to advise me on operational and policy matters relating to the National Drugs Strategy.  Liaison Officers from the Drugs Advisory Group have been nominated for each Drugs Task Force.  These Liaison Officers will act as a conduit to facilitate communication in both directions between the Drugs Task Forces and the OMD.  Furthermore, I am at present half way through a series of meetings with all of the Drugs Task Forces to outline the new arrangements and to encourage their active participation in the shaping of the overall effort to tackle the drugs problem.

The following appendix sets out details in this regard.As part of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-16 launched by An Taoiseach last month, new institutional structures have been put in place to support the implementation of the Strategy, including the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Drugs (OMD).  One of the key roles of the new Office will be to support the work of the Task Forces.The Strategy provides that Task Forces will report to the OMD for expenditure and activity relating to their projects twice a year.  In addition, they will be required to produce an annual statement, in an agreed format, giving an assessment of the work and outputs of their projects — and their broader strategic and co-ordinating work — in the previous 12 months. I expect to receive the first of such reports and statements early in 2010.In addition, statutory, community and voluntary representatives will act as liaison persons between the Task Forces and the Office and will be providing regular updates on relevant issues at the Drugs Advisory Group, which I chair. The Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform is represented on this and all the new bodies that are being put in place to drive the implementation of the Strategy.My Department is in regular contact with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who will be actively involved in rolling out the new Strategy.

The campaign was rolled out across fifteen Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces areas with funding being provided by my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Dormant Accounts Fund.As was highlighted during the launch, the confidential number used in the campaign is open for all to use regardless of the area they come from.  While active promotion took place only in those Task Force areas that expressed an interest, calls have been received from all over the country, including those areas that did not have a campaign.I recently decided to extend the campaign due to its on-going success.  A decision on any further extensions will be made when the data from the campaign has been evaluated.

Both have a community development element and both are delivered through separate local delivery structures.I have already indicated that my strong view is that a single focused programme with a single integrated delivery structure is now needed in order to maximise the impact of these two programmes which serve disadvantaged communities.  The Centre for Effective Services is currently preparing proposals for me in this regard, which will draw on good international practice and independent advice. I hope to receive this in the near future with a view to rolling out a new programme early next year.My overall aim is to ensure that, from 2010, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures.

Taking the baseline as set out in the 2009 Business Plans in each case, it is proposed that the Bodies will be required to achieve efficiency cash-releasing savings of a minimum of 3% in 2009 and a minimum of 6% in 2010.The current position in regard to An Foras Teanga is that both Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency have been asked to review their 2009 and 2010 Business Plans and budgets in this light.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I have not had recent consultations with the Department of Health & Children, nor with the other parties referred to by the Deputy, in regard to research on the effects of cocaethylene.  However, much is already known about its effects.The 2007 report of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs entitled "An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland II" identified the well established risks associated with cocaethylene, which is a naturally produced by-product when cocaine and alcohol are combined.When people mix these substances, the human liver combines them in the system to form cocaethylene and this is more toxic than using either drug alone.  Data from the National Drug Treatment Reporting System confirm that cocaine and alcohol are being used together. The combination of the two drugs intensifies euphoric effects, but cocaethylene can cause more serious physical harm, particularly to the cardiovascular system, as well as having the potential to increase the risk of sudden death.Heightening awareness of the risks associated with the combined use of alcohol and cocaine was a fundamental element of the national cocaine awareness campaign undertaken by the HSE in 2008.  Allied to this, Drugs Task Forces, with funding provided by my Department, undertook local campaigns at that time to dovetail with the national campaign.Furthermore, the recently launched National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 places particular emphasis on prevention.  Various prevention and education interventions are planned, focusing on young people, both in the school and the non-school setting, as well as on the overall population.  A sustained range of awareness campaigns is envisaged as part of this approach.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 aims to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on five pillars, Supply Reduction, Prevention, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.Under the supply reduction pillar there will be renewed emphasis on reducing the volume of illicit drugs, disrupting the activities of organised criminal networks, and targeting income from illicit drug trafficking.  The continued roll-out of Local Policing Fora and the inclusion of drugs issues in a more central way in the work of Joint Policing Committees are also envisaged.Various prevention and education interventions are planned, focusing on young people, both in the school and the non-school setting, as well as on the overall population.  A sustained range of awareness campaigns is envisaged as part of this approach.The new Strategy also envisages the development of a national integrated treatment and rehabilitation service and every effort will be made to encourage drug users to engage with services.  Among the initiatives proposed are speedier access to treatment, the achievement of operational synergies between service providers in the statutory, voluntary and community sectors and increased opiate substitution, needle exchange, treatment in prisons and detox facilities.With respect to research, the emphasis will be on ensuring the availability of accurate, timely, relevant and comparable data to inform decisions on initiatives to counteract problem drug use.I am not in a position to say at this stage what additional financial resources might be allocated to tackle the drugs problem during the period up to 2016.   It is clear that resources will be scarce in the coming years and so it is imperative that the optimum use is made of available funding.  However, this funding is considerable, with over €275m being available across the different Departments and agencies this year.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I am aware of the report in question and I note that it states that, in 2008, nearly 1,000 new attendees accessed the needle exchange facilities provided by the organisation.  However, this figure is in respect of new cases only, and it represents a reduction on the corresponding figure of 1,333 reported by the same organisation for 2007.  Overall, the latest report advises that 4,657 individuals attended the needle exchange facilities and this also shows a slight decrease on the 4,705 recorded in the organisation's 2007 report.Nevertheless, it is, undoubtedly, a matter of concern that 1,000 new cases have come forward in 2008 and there is a need to improve our prevention strategies, as set out in the recently published National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  At the same time, increasing numbers in treatment is something that we are striving to achieve, with a view to moving them towards a drug-free life.Overall it is encouraging that injecting opiate users are making the first steps to access treatment services as this will help to reduce the risks of the spread of blood borne viruses, improve the overall health of individuals and is likely to encourage some opiate users, at least, to engage further with treatment and rehabilitation services.The indications are that the use of heroin has stabilised in the Dublin region.  However, heroin has become more widely dispersed around the country — in particular in the major cities and in Leinster towns.  I accept that heroin remains a very significant problem and responding to it remains as a fundamental element of the new Strategy.Through the implementation of the demand reduction actions under the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation pillars of the new Strategy, I intend that demand for all illicit drugs, including heroin, will be reduced.Various prevention and education interventions are planned, focusing on young people, both in the school and the non-school setting, as well as on the overall population.  A sustained range of awareness campaigns is envisaged as part of this approach.  Furthermore, I recently announced the allocation of funding for the continuation of the successful "Dial to Stop Drugs" campaign. The new Strategy also envisages the development of a national integrated treatment and rehabilitation service and every effort will be made to encourage drug users to engage with the services.  In this context, the Deputy should note that I recently allocated capital funding of €1.1m towards the fast tracked development of six treatment clinics in Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Enniscorthy, Drogheda and Dundalk. It is expected that some of these clinics will be in operation by the end of the year, with treatment being available in all six locations early in 2010.I am determined that real progress will be made across the period of the new Strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way, to achieve the implementation of the agreed actions.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	344	In the current economic environment, the Deputy will be aware that across Government as a whole, we are taking a number of difficult decisions, but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible.In this context, no area is immune to cost-cutting measures and some level of reduction in budget allocations have been made to certain measures and programmes, including the CLÁR Programme.Notwithstanding this — and while some of the measures under the CLÁR Programme are not currently open for new applications — a high number of projects continue to be implemented throughout the country.  Overall, in 2009, I anticipate a significant level of investment under the Programme — of the order of approx €16m. This will allow it to continue to meet its objective of providing funding and co-funding to Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities to accelerate investment in selected priority developments in areas that have suffered significant depopulation.With regard to the RAPID Programme, as the Deputy is aware, it aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 51 designated RAPID areas nationally.  It is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.In 2004, I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes and under these, my Department tops-up the funds of other Departments and agencies to provide small-scale local projects such as playgrounds, traffic measures, improved health facilities, CCTV and top-up funds for projects promoted by sporting organisations under the Sports Capital Programme.  Capital funding of €7.8m was provided to fund the Leverage Schemes in 2008 and I anticipate a spend of a broadly comparable level this year.As the Deputy is aware, in May 2009 the Government approved the inclusion of five new towns in the RAPID programme: Ballina, Co. Mayo; Dungarvan, Co. Waterford; Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford; Mullingar, Co. Westmeath and Rathkeale, Co. Limerick.Overall, while funding for some programmes operated by my Department has been reduced, I still expect that a sufficient spend will be made this year in order to continue to support communities throughout the country.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The decision of any eligible Irish undertaking, including financial institutions, to make an application under any particular EU scheme would be a commercial matter for the institution involved.  Applications are between the undertaking involved and the relevant EU institution providing support. The Irish Authorities would not necessarily be made aware of individual applications made to EU support schemes which allow for direct applications.Irish banks have benefited from the European Investment Banks (EIB) loans for SMEs.  In 2009, the EIB made €300m available to Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Ulster Bank for onward lending to SMEs carrying out investment projects.  This was additional to €50m previously made available to Bank Of Scotland Ireland through its UK parent.The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013 (CIP) contains a financial instrument, the SME Guarantee Facility that aims to improve the financial environment for SMEs by facilitating their access to debt and equity finance, through financial intermediaries. The SME Guarantee Facility is operated by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the European Commission.  Irish financial intermediaries are free to make contact directly with the EIF concerning participation in the facility. I am aware that some have done so.  My Department has informed the Irish Bankers' Federation of the facility, the operation and the scope of the arrangement and has made itself available to any bank interested in pursuing the possibility of securing funding under the SME Guarantee in terms of facilitating contacts with relevant officials in the European Investment Fund (EIF) and/or the European Commission, for further advice and assistance.The Enterprise and Industry Grants Work Programme is an annual listing of the various programmes run by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry and grant programmes, including for example the CIP, linked to it. The CIP Information Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) aims to stimulate innovation and competitiveness and accelerate the development of a sustainable, competitive, innovative and inclusive information society. It supports activities to accelerate innovation and implementation of ICT based services and systems through the wider uptake and best use of ICT and the exploitation of digital content by citizens, governments and businesses. As such it is not a mechanism for providing funding to the financial institutions. The Community Enterprise Centre (CEC) Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, is not financially supported by EU funds and was never designed to be accessible by financial institutions.  The IDABC Programme (Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens) is primarily to encourage interoperabiliy around eGovernment programmes in the Member States. It would not be relevant to financial institutions.The Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) launched in 2005 is an initiative of the European Commission together with the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund in order to promote increased access to finance for the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the regions of the EU.When Ireland's ERDF Structural Programmes 2007-13 were being developed, my Department in consultation with representatives of the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly and Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly had a number of discussions with representatives from the EIB on this issue. As part of these discussions the JEREMIE programme was examined in the context of the existing arrangements in place to assist SMEs in accessing appropriate financial support.  Having reflected on the matter fully and given the nature and structure of the JEREMIE programme, particularly in terms of the scale of operations that would be required to secure EIF participation, it was not considered suited to our Structural Funds programmes.While, participation by the financial institutions in any EU programme is a commercial decision for the institution concerned, nevertheless I would urge financial institutions to make use of EU funding opportunities where these are appropriate to the institution and of benefit to Irish businesses.  For its part, the State will continue to consider participation in appropriate programmes.

Responsibility for implementing the terms of the Government Decision rests with each individual Department. Suppliers pursuing payments should contact the relevant Departmental section with which the contract was arranged.The Secretary General of my Department wrote to all Government Departments on 26th May, asking them to take the necessary steps to implement this commitment and to ensure that Department line staff and Finance Units are made aware of the need to prioritise payments to suppliers to meet the 15 day deadline.The Government Decision of 19 May included a requirement for Departments to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting these requirements.  These reports are to be submitted by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter.  The first such reports are due by 15 October 2009.  Departments are also required to include information on the implementation of the measures in their subsequent Annual Reports.As a result of the measures Departments are required to give greater priority to making timely payments and to ensure that suppliers themselves are aware of how they can assist the process by meeting the requirements of Departments in relation to the submission of invoices.The application of the requirement to other State areas is under review.In light of the above arrangements, I anticipate that compliance with the new procedures, should improve overall cash flow to suppliers, including in particular for small and medium enterprises, through earlier payments by Government Departments.

Specifically the Act provides that the provision of false information in relation to the geographical or commercial origin of a product and where that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make, that such a practice is a misleading commercial practice. Traders who engage in misleading commercial practices commit an offence and are liable on conviction on indictment or on summary conviction, as the case may be, to the fines and penalties provided for under the Act.Evidence of traders engaging in misleading commercial practices should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency, which is the body responsible for the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.As regards issues relating to the West Bank and settlements within the West Bank, such issues essentially involve foreign policy considerations which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

In respect of Redundancy, there are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation and are unable to pay.I am advised by my Department that there are no records in existence of a claim for redundancy payment in respect of the individual in question.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I propose to take Questions Nos.186, 187 and 189 together.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is in receipt of an unprecedented level of claims for redundancy payment that are giving rise to very significant delays in the processing of those payments for both companies and individuals.  Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Department is currently processing rebate claims submitted online from March '09 and claims filed manually from February '09.To put it in perspective, at end September 2009, the number of Redundancy claims paid by my Department relating to applications received in 2009 and earlier years, amounted to 32,127. This equates to payments of around €206.5 million, both to employers and, in some cases, directly to employees.  This means the Department is issuing an average of around €5.7 million per week in redundancy payments. The backlog of applications awaiting payment at end September '09 stands at 43,250.  Of this total, an estimated 10,500 claims are the subject of requests for further information.Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the Deputy with the specific information he has requested as the Department does not collate those statistics on a county basis.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that at this time, my focus and that of my Department is on ensuring that the redundancy payments are expedited as quickly as possible.Naturally, the Tánaiste and I share concerns about current processing times which individuals and employers continue to experience and further initiatives, including that of additional resourcing measures, have been implemented in order to improve the turnaround in the processing of redundancy payments.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and, statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned in June 2009, claiming an inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. In this case the company has now gone into liquidation and the statutory lump sum entitlement will be paid to eligible employees from the Social Insurance Fund.  The Department will then seek to recover  40% of the lump sum paid from the liquidator.  My Department is currently awaiting the submission of documentation from the liquidator.  Once this is received, and if it is in order, the claim will be processed for payment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 to 197, inclusive, together.As I informed the House in reply to a previous Question on 22 September last (No.32397), I propose to bring the Services Directive, 2006/123/EC, into effect by way of statutory instrument, under the European Communities Act 1972.  This is the approach used for the majority of EU Directives and, in this case, will facilitate the transposition of the Directive by the due date, 28 December next.As I stated on that occasion, the negotiation process leading to the adoption of this Directive was lengthy and complex and involved extensive consultation with all key national stakeholders.  The draft Directive was the subject of debates in the Dail on 25th and 26th of January 2006 and in the Seanad (on employment issues) on 25th January 2006.Work on the transposition of the Directive is well advanced and my Department has continued to consult widely.  The Directive is unusual in that the transposition process involves a great deal of administrative work as well as legal drafting. The legal aspect of the transposition process will mainly involve ensuring that the provisions of the Directive are reflected in the transposing instrument. Overall, this work is detailed and technical and involves a great deal of co-operation with other Departments (which has been ongoing since the Directive was first proposed in 2004). The transposing legislation will faithfully reflect what was agreed in 2006 as set out in the Directive.Ireland supports the Directive, as adopted, as a good basis for the creation of a single market in services that will benefit both Irish service providers and Irish consumers.  The Directive will open up European markets to Irish service providers. Potential growth sectors include private education, intellectual property, international sales and marketing, supply chain management, and professional and consultancy services.  The Directive will also benefit Irish recipients of services, including business consumers.Irish firms exporting services will gain easier access to the markets of other EU Member States where they currently face non-tariff barriers. This is the export penetration effect of the Directive. On the other hand, Irish firms supplying services to consumers here will face greater competition from firms in other Member States. This is the import penetration effect and will create challenges for Irish firms on cost and competitiveness grounds. Taken together, the export and import penetration effects will have a positive effect on the Irish economy, including consumers, but not necessarily for every service provider.The overall effect of the creation of a single market for services will be to enhance Ireland's competitiveness. It will also enhance the EU's competitiveness by creating the necessary economies of scale for European service providers, who are facing an increasingly globalised economy, to challenge service providers in world markets.Forfás estimated in 2008 that gross value added in services to the Irish economy could increase by €540 million per annum as a result of the Services Directive. Net employment in the services sector would increase by over 4,000. Average real wages in the service economy were expected to increase by €60 million per annum. The value of Irish services exports was projected to rise by between €10 billion and €14 billion per annum. Those projections are currently being re-examined in the light of the economic downturn and revised projections will be published when the legislation comes into force.

These are the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations 1979, S.I. 311/1979. Under these regulations, the dispensing of petrol must be constantly supervised and controlled by an authorized person, located at the petrol station.The only situation where petrol could be dispensed in the absence of such an authorized person is under the conditions attached to the licence granted to the operator of a petrol station. In practice, the general responsibility for the licensing of petrol stations, including the conditions attaching to licences, rests with the Local Authorities.Health and Safety Authority inspectors have power to inspect petrol stations under the Dangerous Substances Acts as do authorised servants and officers of local authorities. The Health and Safety Authority includes a small number of petrol stations in its inspection programme each year. However, it primarily carries out those inspections in the context of its workplace health and safety remit under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005 — its remit and powers under the 2005 Act are considerably wider than those under the Dangerous Substances Acts. Essentially, the Authority addresses the inspection of (manned) petrol stations in the same way that it addresses any other workplace, largely from a risk assessment and safety management perspective with a focus primarily on employees.I understand that, in recent times, the issue of unmanned petrol stations and the conditions that might be expected to apply to their operation has been considered by officers from a number of fire authorities, the Health and Safety Authority and the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Persons interested in establishing an unattended, petrol-dispensing outlet, should apply for a licence to the relevant local (fire) authority responsible for the place in which it is to be situated.

It is not a form that is submitted to the Department for any statutory purpose. There is no obligation on the employer or employee to use the RP9 form for this purpose and Notice may be given orally without the use of the RP9.In general, a layoff situation exists when an employer suspends an employee's employment because there is no work available, when the employer expects the cessation of work to be temporary and when the employer notifies the employee to this effect.  While layoff situations are commonly experienced in the construction sector, there is no legislative exclusion in relation to the use of periods of layoff for other sectors.An employee who has been laid off or kept on short time or a mixture of both either for four consecutive weeks or for a broken series of six weeks where all six weeks occur within a 13 week period, may, if he so wishes, claim a redundancy payment.  The Redundancy Payment claim would be conditional on the employer not issuing a counter claim by offering 13 weeks continual employment, starting within four weeks of the date of receipt of the employees’ claim for redundancy.If the employee chooses not to accept the offer of continual employment, he/she is deemed to have voluntarily left the employment and the question of minimum notice payments does not arise.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, he/she may qualify for a redundancy payment, which would be a matter, in the first instance for the employer but could, if necessary, be submitted to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for adjudication.  The employee does not have to claim statutory redundancy as soon as he has been laid off or kept on short time but could submit this at a later time if he so chooses.

The nutraceuticals market is frequently defined as encompassing functional foods, vitamins, minerals and supplements and it is evident that it can offer lucrative opportunities to the indigenous food industry.  Currently, Irish manufacturing capability is largely confined to a small number of large dairy companies and SMEs in the ingredient and beverage sectors.  These companies have successfully launched products such as fortified milk drinks, probiotic yoghurts, cholesterol lowering spreads, energy drinks and functional waters.Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in supporting this sector and has prioritised it for development.  For example, in July 2008, I announced a €19.5m investment (funded by Enterprise Ireland) towards Food for Health Ireland (FHI).  FHI is a unique partnership between four of Ireland's major dairy processing companies and four public research organisations.  The industry-led research agenda will focus its efforts over a five-year period on maximising the health potential of bioactives derived from milk.  In general, the nutraceutical sector is supported through existing EI grant funding mechanisms and EI has supported large-scale strategic investments in research and development for key players in the sector.  Other supports to this sector include capital grants and support towards strategic Human Research Development programmes.

Section 29 (3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority is independent in the performance of its functions. Under section 30 (1)(b) of that Act, the Competition Authority is responsible for investigating any breach of the Act. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority I have no direct function in the matter.That being said, I understand that the case the Deputy refers to, is one which was heard in the Central Criminal Court sitting in Galway earlier this year.  The case was prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions following a referral of a file from the Authority.

Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Department is currently processing rebate claims submitted online from March '09 and claims filed manually from February '09.To put it in perspective, at end September 2009, the number of Redundancy claims paid by my Department relating to applications received in 2009 and earlier years, amounted to 32,127. This equates to payments of around €206.5 million, both to employers and, in some cases, directly to employees.  This means the Department is issuing an average of around €5.7 million per week in redundancy payments. The backlog of applications awaiting payment at end September '09 stands at 43,250.  Of this total, an estimated 10,500 claims are the subject of requests for further information.Naturally, the Tánaiste and I share concerns about current processing times which individuals and employers continue to experience and further initiatives, including that of additional resourcing measures, have been implemented in order to improve the turnaround in the processing of redundancy payments.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	403	This is not an issue that has been raised by the relevant stakeholders to my Department.  I assume the Deputy is referring to payments made in sterling when referring to transactions being made to suppliers and contractors based in the United Kingdom, which is outside of the eurozone.Transaction charges for retail cross border credit transfers in euro within the EU must be charged at the same rate as the equivalent domestic transaction.  This obligation flows from the Cross-Border Payments Regulation (Regulation 2560/2001(EC)) adopted by the EU on 19 December 2001 which established the principle that charges levied by an institution in respect of certain cross-border payments in euro will be the same as the charges levied by the same institution for corresponding domestic payments.  Non-eurozone Member States were entitled to opt in to the provisions of the Regulation.  However, I understand that the United Kingdom has chosen not to do so.  Therefore payments made in sterling to or from the United Kingdom are not subject to the Regulation.  Non-eurozone Member States may opt to implement the Regulation fully at any stage; however this is a matter for the relevant Member States.With regard to the regulation of bank charges in the State, there are basically two categories of charges applied by the banks — interest-related banking charges and non-interest-related banking charges and fees.Interest-related charges are determined by the banks themselves on the basis of market considerations and neither the Minister for Finance nor the Financial Regulator have any statutory role in this matter.  In setting the level of such charge for a borrower, a bank would have regard to a variety of factors such as the prevailing rate set by the European Central Bank, the customer's credit history, the risk perceived to attach to the loan and the cost of funds to the bank.The regulation of non-interest-related charges, such as cross border banking charges, is vested in the Financial Regulator under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and credit institutions are obliged to seek the prior approval of the Regulator before any increase in such charges above the previously approved level.  In fact, Ireland is the only EU country with statutory control on such fee increases.The Financial Regulator assesses each charging proposal against the criteria set down in the Act and either approves the charge at the notified level, approves it at a lower level or rejects the proposal.  The criteria set out in the Act are:the promotion of fair competition;statement of commercial justification;a credit institution passing any costs on to its customers; andthe effect on customers of any proposal to impose or change any charge in relation to the provision of such service.By way of concluding, it is a matter for individual businesses to actively ‘shop around' to secure the best value for money in the costs associated with cross border banking charges.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that there is no internationally recognised method for determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes.  However, the Commissioners have previously given a tentative estimate that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2008 were untaxed.  The tax involved would amount to approximately €380m. It should be noted however that, in addition to illicit cigarettes, this estimate also includes legal cross-border shopping purchases brought into the State for personal consumption.As regards the question of staffing resources available to Revenue's Customs Service to combat cigarette smuggling, enforcement staff are deployed at all key ports and airports for the purpose of detection, interception and seizure of smuggled goods including contraband cigarettes.  Staff numbers at these locations are subject to continuous review and these officers are frequently augmented by additional staff from other areas where the need arises for specific operational reasons.  In addition, enforcement officers carry out checks at inland premises including retail outlets, markets, warehouses etc. for contraband cigarettes that may have evaded detection at the point of importation.Enforcement action undertaken by Customs in 2008 resulted in 10,191 seizures of cigarettes totalling in excess of 135m cigarettes, while up to the end of August 2009, Customs have made 7164 seizures of cigarettes amounting to 61m cigarettes.On the question of a possible increase in the number of Customs enforcement officers, as the Deputy is aware, this issue needs to be viewed in the context of the current restriction on recruitment in the public service.  However, the number of Revenue staff deployed in particular areas has always been and will continue to be decided on the basis of business needs and risk assessment.  The Commissioners also believe that improved strategies, tactics, detection techniques and training are equally if not more important than increases in the number of officers.  These include more effective profiling, improved intelligence gathering, continued co-operation with the legitimate tobacco industry and the better use of scanning technology.  All these matters are under continuous review as part of an ongoing assessment of Revenue's ability to deal with the increasing threat to excise duties.  In this regard, a new tobacco tax stamp with added security features was recently introduced and a second container scanner is due to be delivered by the end of November.Finally, I am aware of various reports in the media on the impact of the illicit cigarette trade on legitimate retailers.  It is inevitable that retailers do suffer some loss in trade as a result of smuggling.  The Commissioners therefore hope to increase the current level of detection through the deployment of improved strategies and tactics etc, as referred to above.

A number of approaches have been taken in recent years specifically aimed at making PAYE customers aware of their tax credit and relief entitlements and making it easier to claim them.On-line facilities are now available to PAYE customers. Once registered, the self-service facilities enable PAYE customers to manage their tax affairs in a quick, free and secure manner and at a time that suits them best.Other self-service options available include text messaging and touch-tone telephone.Revenue also issued a new PAYE Guide for Employees with 2009 Tax Credit Certificates.  The guide, written in simple language, explains the mechanisms of the PAYE system, explains tax credits and reliefs, encourages customers to apply for them and promotes PAYE Anytime.Revenue has been making considerable efforts to automate tax credit and relief entitlements. Developments in this area include the automatic granting of age credits, the introduction of DIRT exempt accounts for over 65s and the issue of automatic refunds for tuition fees and non-reimbursed amounts for prescribed drugs.Mortgage interest relief is provided at source through financial institutions under arrangements which were put in place with effect from 1 January 2002, that is the TRS system.  This means that the mortgage holders get the benefit of the relief directly from their mortgage providers in the form of reduced monthly repayments which take account of the tax relief. In addition, health insurance relief is also provided at source by way of reduced payments.Tax relief on contributions to occupational pension schemes for PAYE earners is provided on a "net pay" basis. This means that employee pensions contributions are deducted from gross pay by employers before income tax and levies are calculated.Simplification Initiatives for Self-Employed TaxpayersRegistration thresholds for VAT have been increased in recent years to reduce the administrative burden on smaller businesses.Revenue reduced the frequency of tax returns and payments required from smaller businesses during 2006 and 2007. It regularly reviews the liability of cases and transfers customers to the less frequent filing programme where eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly simplified arrangements were extended to include newly eligible customers from 1 January 2009. Over 90,000 businesses currently benefit from less frequent PAYE/PRSI and VAT filing obligations.With a view to making tax compliance easier for small businesses, Revenue carried out a detailed review of self-assessed returns and identified taxpayers to whom the shorter Form 11E is more appropriate.  As a result the 2008 Form 11E issued to 125,000 customers who file paper returns as opposed to 21,000 in 2007.  Revenue will continue to review self-assessed returns with the intention of issuing a shorter form to as many categories of customers as possible.A new system of accounting for VAT on construction services came into effect from 1 September 2008.  The effect of the reverse charge mechanism is that it simplifies the operation of VAT in the sector and there are cash flow benefits to principals.A new Guide to VAT was also published in July 2008 and updated by Addendum to include the Finance Act (No. 2) 2008 changes.  There are over fifty VAT Information leaflets available in support of the Guide.Revenue's On-line Service (ROS) offers business and individuals a quick, secure and cost effective method to manage their tax affairs on-line and the number of customers using it continues to increase. Revenue has a number of incentives to encourage customers to avail of ROS.Revenue's website (www.revenue.ie) was redesigned and launched in December 2008 following wide-ranging consultation and was aimed at delivering improvements in quality and timeliness, information and services.In June 2009, Revenue launched its new National Excise Licence Office which reduces the administrative burden associated with Excise Licence obligations.Work will continue in this area with the aim of reducing any remaining complexity in the taxation and relief system, both as it pertains to the individual taxpayer and small businesses.

I have also had some discussions with representatives of potential investors and I understand that some covered institutions have also engaged in such discussions.  For example, AIB has indicated that it has received interest from a third party with a potential interest in taking a minority stake in the bank and that it will continue to explore strategic options including potential investments in the bank.  Bank of Ireland has also stated that it believes that, in the event that additional capital is required, it could be generated internally and/or through access to the capital markets.  To date, none of these discussions have resulted in any detailed investment proposal. However, the Deputy will appreciate that much of this information is received in confidence and is market sensitive and is a matter in the first instance for the banks themselves.As the Deputy is aware, I have consistently stated that there is an onus on the banks covered by the bank guarantee scheme to attract private investors.  In my recent speech moving the Second Stage of the NAMA Bill, I made it clear that the Government expects institutions to explore all available options for raising additional capital. The removal of the toxic assets from the balance sheets of the banks will go someway to reducing any risk which private investors may perceive in investing capital in the banks.  If sufficient capital cannot be raised independently, the Government remains committed to providing the covered institutions with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements.This is to ensure that the banks remain sufficiently capitalised to enable them to lend into the economy.

This measure is one small part of this Government's concerted effort to raise the revenue necessary to help address the serious recent decline in the public finances.All taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill. As the Deputy is aware, it is not customary for the Minister of Finance to comment on specific tax and expenditure changes in advance of the Budget.

Every effort is being made to collate the information and I will reply directly to the Deputy when this process is completed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that before Budget 2009, excise duty on wine remained unchanged since the Budget of 1994. The growth in the consumption of wine has been strong over the last ten years particularly relative to other alcohol products. It should also be noted the excise on wine remains considerably lower than excise on spirits.The alcohol products tax content of a bottle of wine was 30.6% of the retail price in 1994 and following Budget 2009 is now 25.7%. Under EU legislation, Member States must levy the same excise duty on all still wine products and the same excise duty on all sparkling wine products. It is therefore not possible to differentiate excise duty on wine according to where it is sold or consumed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Credit Union Act 1997 has served credit unions well providing stability and legal certainty during a period of substantial growth and development of the movement.  The need for some modernisation of the legislative and regulatory framework for credit unions has become evident over time and there is consensus among all stakeholders that the current legislative framework needs reform.  While some preparatory work has already been done in this regard there is however no clear consensus at this stage on the future shape of the reformed legislative framework for credit unions.  I have asked the Chair of the Financial Regulator to initiate a review of credit unions which it is hoped will make an important contribution to identifying the appropriate way forward.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	415	A core objective of the legislative and regulatory framework for Credit Unions in Ireland is to ensure the safety and soundness of credit unions.  This requires prudent lending and investment decisions by Boards of credit unions to safeguard members' savings.  The restrictions contained in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended, are an important asset and liability tool for credit unions as the funding of credit unions is predominantly provided on a short term basis in the form of on-demand savings and consequently the limits on longer term-term lending are necessary.I am aware that credit unions are seeking to facilitate revised repayment instalments for credit union members currently experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances but that these endeavours, in certain circumstances, run up against the current Section 35 limits on longer-term lending for some credit unions.  Subject to the over-arching considerations that the financial position of a credit union, the security of members' savings and accurate reporting of the financial status of a credit union is maintained, it should be possible to explore all reasonable steps to allow a member, in carefully monitored and controlled circumstances, to re-schedule their repayments to a level which is affordable to them. Of course, each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist, and where members are in difficulty the process of facilitating them must be transparent to board members and regulators so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.My Department has, at my request, reactivated the Group, representative of stakeholders, the Regulatory Authority and my Department, which successfully reviewed the Section 35 lending limits in 2006. The mandate for this Group is to find a solution to this issue.  My officials have consulted with the relevant stakeholders and have received proposals from them on how we might best proceed.  This work is being brought forward with a view to reaching agreement on this issue as soon as possible.

Consultations have already taken place with local Court users, and it is expected that plans will be prepared by the end of this year.  This will enable further consultations to take place with the Courts staff, Judiciary and local Court users, with a view to finalising a brief of requirements.  Tender documentation will then be prepared.

These works consist of a permanent roundabout to replace the current temporary structure, new drainage works to prevent a recurrence of flooding on the Main Road, laying of a new network of gas pipes and the repair of the Castleknock Gates, damaged by a heavy goods vehicle.  The estimated cost of the works at the roundabout is €192,000 ex VAT.The works are part of a very much larger scheme for the complete refurbishment of Chesterfield Avenue, submitted to Dublin City Council for planning permission and subsequently rejected by An Bord Pleanála, primarily because of the bus lane element of the plan.The works at the Mountjoy roundabout to create a permanent structure for the safety of all users and to alleviate the flooding difficulties that continue to occur at this junction were planned to be carried out as part of the overall Chesterfield Avenue scheme.  However, once the planning situation had been clarified, there was a narrow window of opportunity to complete the roundabout works, which are permitted under planning laws, before Garda restrictions on roadworks come into effect at the end of November as part of Operation Freeflow.  As soon as the planning permission was rejected, a tendering process was undertaken and a contract placed.  This enabled the urgent works at this dangerous junction to be carried out separately to the overall Chesterfield Avenue scheme, which will now have to go through the planning process again.It is anticipated that, if a decision to carry out the works had not been taken at this time, it would be 2011 at the earliest before another opportunity would have presented itself to enable the OPW to carry out the necessary works.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 gives an income tax exemption to sporting bodies, which have been approved by Revenue on the basis that the body has been established for, and exists for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports. The exemption extends to the amount of the income of the approved body as has been, or will be, applied to the sole purpose mentioned.Sections 610 and Schedule 15, Paragraph 37, TCA 1997 gives a capital gains tax exemption in respect of chargeable gains accruing to sporting bodies to the extent that the income of the sporting body is exempt from income tax or corporation tax as the case may be.  Where a sporting body realises a capital sum from the disposal of an asset, the exemption applies only to the extent that the proceeds are applied for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.The administration of tax exemptions for Sports Bodies is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. It is understood that the detailed application of funds has to be considered by the Revenue Commissioners specifically, and in context, in each individual case, to determine whether any implications arise for the tax exemption or the body's approval by Revenue. It has been confirmed by Revenue that bodies granted sporting tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused review towards ensuring that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled. All relevant matters, including adherence to any "use of income" clauses attached to the exemption, are considered in the context of such reviews.If the Deputy has specific information in regard to abuse of the tax exemption conditions by any sporting body, then such information should be provided to the Revenue Commissioners for consideration and further investigation, as necessary.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the air travel tax arising from travel undertaken in any month is payable by the 23rd of the following month. The yields from the air travel tax received in the period from May to September 2009, in respect of travel undertaken during the months April to August 2009 are as follows:Month€mMay9.6June11.5July11.9August12.5September12.4Total57.9It should be recognised that visitors will only be subject to the tax on their return air journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving total travel and accommodation costs should have an extremely limited effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.The estimated yield from the air travel tax is €85m in 2009 and €125m in a full year.We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.

These Civil Service numbers are based on returns from all Departments and Offices.  (The Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism provided an overall number).In the wider public service, some 347 public servants had applied and 130 of these had been approved.  However, it should be noted that information from the Education Sector will not be available until the end of October and from the Local Authorities until November.  Also, processing of applications under the ISER has been suspended in the Health Sector as a result of a direction by IMPACT and some other health unions to their members not to cooperate with redeployment.

It should be noted that this does not include the numbers employed in the Non-Commercial Agencies as officials are currently collecting this information.With regard to applications for exemptions under the moratorium, the information available indicates that, to date, the Department of Finance has received approximately 1,237 written applications for the filling of specific posts comprehended by the moratorium, of which the filling of 502 has been sanctioned.  Civil Service full-time posts accounted for 328 applications and sanction was conveyed in 158 cases.  The main areas of exemption were the prison service, educational psychologists and social welfare staff.  Applications for the filling of Public Service posts accounted for some 909 posts and sanction was conveyed in 344 cases.  The main areas of exemption were in the Department Education and Science (renewal of secondment of teachers to Education Services) and the Department of Health and Children (mental health nurses).

I should explain that the clearing system in Ireland is governed by private arrangements between the participating institutions, operating under the aegis of the Irish Payment Services Organisation (IPSO).  The clearing cycle for a cheque should in normal circumstances take no more than three business days, with cheques that are unpaid generally being returned within 5 working days.  This might occur where there are insufficient funds in the payer's bank account.  Presentation of a cheque by a payee to his or her bank occurs on Day 1 of the clearing cycle. The payee will commence receiving interest from Day 2, which is the same day settlement takes place between the payee's bank and the drawer's bank at the Central Bank.  The drawer's bank account is debited on Day 2 or Day 3 of the cycle.   The clearing cycle may be quicker (in some cases instantaneous) if a cheque is both drawn on and collected on the same bank.There is also provision for special presentation of a cheque for immediate payment, which is only available in the Dublin area for cheques up to a value of €625,000 and where the payee presents the cheque before 3 p.m. in the nominated branch of the bank.This timeframe is also dependent on the bank or financial institution being a member of the Irish Paper Clearing Company (IPCC) Ltd.  The IPCC is responsible for the clearing and settlement of all paper payment instruments in Ireland.  Any bank or financial institution outside of this framework may have a longer cheque clearance cycle.  A list of members is available directly from IPSO at www.ipso.ie.As to when any particular bank will permit a customer to draw against lodged cheques, this is an individual bank decision based on its own risk management and credit control arrangements.  I would expect that all banks would inform their customers of the relevant terms and conditions. If the Deputy wishes to provide me with further information on this matter, I can arrange for enquiries to be made.I think it is also important to point out that this question also highlights the disadvantages of the continued high usage of cheques as a method of payment within the commercial sector in Ireland.It might be noted that electronic payment transactions have the potential to achieve significant savings for individual businesses; in particular electronic payments processing and invoice presentation can realise significant administrative cost savings, improved efficiency and improvements in the quality of customer service.  This has the potential to benefit not just businesses but also their customers.Government policy is to promote the increased use of electronic payments throughout our economy. In promoting this policy objective, I have reduced stamp duty on combined ATM cards from €10 to €5 in Budget 2009, building upon changes in the previous year's Budget.  I also increased stamp duty on cheques, from 30 cent to 50 cent per cheque, to further disincentivise cheque usage.I have recently made regulations (S.I. 383 of 2009) to transpose the EU Payment Services Directive (Directive 2007/64/EC), which, inter alia, establishes rules on the maximum time for the execution of both paper-initiated and electronic payments. These regulations will take effect from 1 November 2009.I have also previously indicated the need to establish new governance arrangements to further promote the development of electronic payments in our economy, and I am currently making preparations for the establishment of a task force comprising key representatives of the main stakeholders to direct the preparation and implementation of a national payments implementation plan over a two year period.

I am pleased to say that the measures taken to date by the recapitalised banks, including those relating to lending, are outlined in the supplementary booklet on NAMA. I would direct the Deputy to Section 4 of that booklet.The Credit Supply Clearing Group under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade & Employment has responsibility for identifying specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  This group includes members from the following organisations; Department of Finance, Department of Enterprise, Trade & Employment, Department of Arts, Sport & Tourism, ISME, SFA, IFA, Chambers Ireland, IBF, AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland (Ireland), National Irish Bank, Ulster Bank, Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Irish Hoteliers Federation and Fáilte Ireland.I published the independent review of credit availability conducted by Mazars on 10 July 2009.  A follow on report to look at the situation since then is in the process of being undertaken by my Department and other stakeholders. As with the original report, both the supply and demand sides will be covered. I expect that the demand side survey will commence this week.

Guardianship, as defined in the National Monuments Acts, confers on the Commissioners of Public Works the responsibility for the maintenance of the structure only and does not affect the owner's property rights relating to the property.  The guardianship deed did not include provision for a public access route.Earlier this year, I visited Rathcoffey Castle, and met with local interest groups concerning their desire to access the property.  I also met with the landowner who was prepared, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, to facilitate public access under strict conditions on agreed dates that would not impinge on his farming operation.  As a result, the Office of Public Works co-ordinated and advertised an open date for 24 September 2009.  It is intended to hold similar arrangements into the future.

This advice will help to better inform the deliberations to formulate a policy decision on the issue.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The role and functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) in dealing with consumer complaints complements that of the Financial Regulator in protecting the interests of consumers of financial services as a whole. During the passage of the FSO legislation through the Oireachtas in 2004 it was stated, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, that the Ombudsman's remit essentially is to deal with individual complaints from customers of financial institutions and it is the responsibility of the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator to deal with general issues relating to the protection of consumers.The relevant legislation provides for co-operation between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator on general issues relating to the protection of consumers. A Memorandum of Understanding has been concluded between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator to ensure the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  An issue drawing attention to a general breach affecting consumers can be referred by the Financial Services Ombudsman to the Financial Regulator. Such issues can then be examined by the Financial Regulator to consider if there are any suspected breaches of the relevant regulatory requirements including the Consumer Protection Code. The Financial Regulator can, as part of its administrative sanctions regime, seek to mediate or take regulatory action in relation to a firm including an order to make refunds to a firm's customers where appropriate.I have asked the FSO and the Financial Regulator to review their current co-operation arrangements to ensure that these work smoothly where a finding of the FSO in an individual case may have implications for a broader group of customers of a financial services firm. The Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator have responded in a joint submission to the Department that the Memorandum of Understanding is operating as intended and that co-operation between both offices is highly satisfactory and allows issues to evolve. They have also advised that where a pricing error occurs after the 1 July 2007 the provider is required under the Consumer Protection Code to speedily, efficiently and fairly correct such an error.The Deputy may be aware that a High Court judgment in October 2007 confirmed that the Financial Services Ombudsman's power of direction, except in relation to a change in general practice, may only relate to an individual claimant and does not extend to payment of compensation for other consumers in relation to similar conduct of the financial service provider.Legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General highlighted difficulties in ensuring due process is afforded in introducing a retrospective element to FSO's decisions extending beyond individual claimants.On the basis of this advice I do not propose to pursue this matter further.

Within the constraint set by the statutory requirement that it be cost-neutral, PIPS will provide trustees with the opportunity to purchase pensions at a discounted rate as a special support for pensioners in the absence of a solvent employer.Work on the scheme is well advanced and it is my intention to bring forward the necessary regulations giving effect to PIPS shortly.  Once that has been done, it is open to the trustees of any pension scheme that meets the criteria to apply.

The aggregate allocation for 2010 amounts to €6.621 billion, or about 4.7% of GNP, which is a considerable commitment to capital investment in times of constrained resources. Each Department was also given approval to enter into contractual commitments amounting to €20 billion over the period up to the end of 2013. This financial framework, which is subject to normal budgetary review at each budget, will give Departments a basis to plan and progress those projects which make the greatest economic return, improve national competitiveness and protect and sustain employment. The relevant Departments are responsible for the management of capital investment within the limits of this overall investment framework.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxation treatment applying to donations of land to a charity is as follows.Section 611 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) involving the donation of an asset by a taxpayer to a charity. The donation must be a bone fide donation and not a commercial transaction at arm's length. In such circumstances, the transaction is treated as giving rise to neither a gain nor a loss for CGT purposes.Section 82 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for relief from stamp duty on the conveyance, transfer or lease of land made, or agreed to be made, for charitable purposes to a body of persons established for charitable purposes only or to the trustees of a trust so established.Section 76 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) Consolidation Act 2003 provides that a gift which is taken for charitable purposes is exempt from CAT to the extent that it has been or will be applied for such purposes.I am further advised by Revenue that income tax relief for donations to charities under Section 848A of the TCA 1997 only applies where the donation takes the form of money or designated securities; it does not apply to a donation of land.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of whether farmers are entitled to claim credit for, or a repayment of, VAT charged to them on the installation of wind turbines on their farms depends on whether or not the farmer is registered for VAT.Farmers who are registered for VAT are accountable persons for VAT in respect of all their taxable activities, whether those activities consist solely of farming or both farming and other activities such as the generation of electricity for provision to the national grid.  As accountable persons for VAT, they would be entitled to claim input credit for VAT charged on the installation of a wind turbine for use in their taxable activities.In so far as farmers who are not registered for VAT are concerned, they are not in the normal course entitled to credit for, or repayment of, VAT incurred by them on their business inputs.  However, farmers not registered for VAT are entitled to a flat-rate addition of 5.2% on supplies of livestock to a VAT registered person in the state subject to the farmer issuing a flat-rate invoice in the appropriate form.  In addition, the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 25) Order, 1993 does provide for refunds to unregistered farmers for tax borne on the “construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure which is designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business”.  However, while the installation of a wind turbine may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not “designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business”.  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required.  Consequently, the installation of wind turbines does not come within the scope of the refund order.

This framework commenced in February 2008.The framework agreement is intended to maximise volume discounts and provide for reductions in administrative and transaction costs for providers and public sector purchasers.My Department ran a competition under the framework for its own mobile voice and data services in May 2008 and selected O2 as the most economically advantageous response.  My own mobile phone service is included in this contract. The contract will be tendered again before the end of 2009.I have been informed by the Office of Public Works that Minister Martin Mansergh's mobile phone contract is with Vodafone.

These changes, including the introduction of the €15,000 threshold, took effect from 1 May 2009 and were not backdated.  Therefore, no exemption threshold would apply during the period from 1 March 2009, when the deduction first took effect, to 30 April 2009 and no refund would arise in respect of that period as a result of the changes in rates and bands.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	437	It is understood that the Financial Services Authority in the UK is currently engaged in a consultation process on the matters the Deputy refers to. As such, the outcome of this process is yet to be determined.There are currently no plans to proscribe the use of commissions by financial intermediaries in Ireland as it is considered that the existing legislative protections in place for the consumer sufficiently empowers the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman to investigate and, if necessary, sanction any misbehaviour in relation to mis-selling of financial products or the provision of financial advice which does not serve the best interests of the customer.The Financial Regulator Consumer Protection Code, which came into effect in August 2006, is a legally enforceable statutory code which is applicable to all entities which the Financial Regulator regulates.Under the General Principles of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code), all regulated firms are required to: act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of the customer; make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer; and seek to avoid conflicts of interest.The disclosure of sales remuneration in relation to certain life assurance products is required by the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001. These Regulations cover life assurance products, personal pension plans and life assurance investment and savings products.The sale of investment products is covered by the Regulations which transposed the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) into Irish law.  Under these Regulations firms are required to ensure that there is clear and prior disclosure to its clients detailing the existence, nature and amount of the commission.

One component part is taxable; the other is not. The part of the payment which relates to the 2006 licence fee is not liable to tax. I understand that when making payments Bord Iascaigh Mhara identified the amount of the payment relating to the 2006 licence fee so that this could be excluded from income tax returns.The taxable component is that part of the payment related to catch. This part of the payment is based on the verifiable catch for each licence holder and the average net income per salmon for the 5 years 2001 to 2005 i.e. €23 per salmon. This element is an income replacement figure and is taxable on recipients as income of the year of receipt.I am also advised that to facilitate recipients who wished to spread the taxable amount over three tax years, eligible applicants could opt under the scheme to receive their payment in one sum or alternatively to have it paid in equal amounts over a three-year period (2007 to 2009).

Arthur Cox was awarded the legal mandate and HSBC were awarded the bankingadvisory mandate. In July 2009, the NTMA issued a tender to procure general banking advisors in relation to the whole financial system through the procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie and Rothschilds were awarded this mandate to 30 June 2010. All contracts were issued under my direction.It is the policy of the NTMA not to publicly disclose the value of individual contracts awarded.

Simultaneously, payments are made into a life insurance policy which is designed to cover the cost of repaying the principal loan amount by the end of the loan term. The majority of these policies are investment based and as a result they are exposed to risks that may deliver positive, negative or neutral returns over any given period. This element of risk makes it impossible to state with certainty what the final value of the policy will be at maturity. Forecasting future values means that assumptions of future returns are made.The popularity of endowment mortgages was at the highest during the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the time, there were a number of advantages associated with these products, such as the availability of mortgage interest relief and tax relief. Another perceived advantage was the possibility that a surplus sum could accrue to the customer at the end of the loan term.While a voluntary code did exist in Ireland in relation to the sale of endowment mortgages, there was no comprehensive statutory code in place in Ireland covering the sale of these products at the time they were sold. When the risks associated with the product were highlighted in Ireland in the 1990s, specific provisions were incorporated into the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 which requires warnings to the effect that the proceeds of a policy may not be sufficient to repay a mortgage. Endowment mortgage savings plans must, under the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, be reviewed by the life company at least every five years to check if the plan is on track to repay the mortgage and the consumer has to be sent a statement on this at the five yearly intervals.The sale of endowment mortgages is now covered by the provisions of the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code, particularly in terms of knowing the consumer and the suitability of the recommended product. Borrowers that are of the opinion that they been mis-sold endowment mortgages, should, in the first instance make a formal complaint to their provider. If, having exercised the provider's formal complaints process, the consumer is still not satisfied, he or she can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman for consideration in accordance with his statutory remit.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The position is that the question of whether an individual providing translation services — or any other services — is engaged under either a contract of service (i.e. an employee) or a contract for service (i.e. self-employed) is a question of fact and of general law.  Regardless of how the parties to an engagement may describe themselves, all the relevant factors (including written, oral and implied details) that bear on the relationship between the parties must be examined, given their proper weight and a decision made on their overall effect.To provide some clarity as to whether an individual is employed or self-employed, the Employment Status Group (set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness) published a Code of Practice for determining Employment or Self-employment status of Individuals.  As the Deputy may be aware, under Towards 2016 — The Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement, a commitment was given to the Social Partners that the regulatory bodies (i.e. the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA)) would be active in the area of correctly establishing the status — employed or self-employed — of individuals.  Arising from this, the Code of Practice was re-launched by the Social Partners in December 2007 and re-issued to all employers in early 2008.In addition, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that cases come to their attention wherein individuals have been incorrectly classified (either by the individuals or by the person engaging those individuals) as self-employed in relation to a particular engagement.  If, on an examination of the facts and circumstances and having regard for the Code of Practice referred to above, Revenue find that individuals are, in fact, employees rather than self-employed contractors, Revenue will notify the person engaging those individuals to register for, and operate, the PAYE system on payments made to those individuals.Depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, an individual may be a full time employee, a part-time employee, a temporary employee or a casual employee.  The fact that individuals may not have continual work does not, of itself, make such individuals self-employed contractors.

The earnings cap, originally set at an amount of €254,000, was indexed with effect from 2007, and for the 2008 tax year, stood at just over €275,000.Changes were announced in Budget 2009 and included in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 to improve the equity of the existing tax arrangements in the pensions area by significantly reducing the annual earnings cap for 2009 to €150,000.The annual earnings cap and age-related percentage limits for pension contribution purposes referred to above do not apply to employer contributions to occupational pension schemes but only to employee contributions.The Commission on Taxation Report makes the point that changes could be made to the terms of employment contracts, due to the reduction in the annual earnings cap, to provide for a switch from employee contributions to employer contributions. In this regard, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that any attempts to circumvent the limits imposed on personal contributions to pension schemes in this way would fall foul of the rules governing salary sacrifice arrangements.The Revenue's Commissioners' position on salary sacrifice generally, is that if an employee forgoes any remuneration by way of any arrangement, either by changing the existing terms or contract of employment or creating new terms or contract of employment, or indeed if there are no recorded terms and conditions in relation to the employment, the employee will remain taxable on their 'gross' income. Remuneration sacrificed is to be considered as an application of the income earned by an employee rather than an expense incurred by that individual's employer.Therefore, any arrangement under which an employee waives an entitlement to remuneration or accepts a reduction in remuneration in return for a corresponding payment by the employer into a pension scheme is an application of the employee's income and is not acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners. While under such an arrangement the payment is ostensibly being made by the employer, it is in practice being made by the employee. This has always been Revenue's view and is reflected in paragraph 3.8 of Chapter 3 of the Revenue Pensions Manual. Section 118B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which came into effect on 31 January 2008, deals with the issue of salary sacrifice and confirms the Revenue Commissioners’ view that such arrangements have always given rise to a tax charge. The section ensures that, with certain exceptions, the remuneration sacrificed is taxable in full and the employer must operate PAYE and PRSI on it.

In relation to the €77 billion loan portfolio projected to transfer to NAMA, the NTMA has indicated that the estimated total notional value of these derivatives is €15 billion.  These derivatives are typically interest rate swaps or equivalent instruments designed to hedge interest rate payments and the notional value refers to the underlying assets to which the derivatives are related.  These derivatives are an integral part of the loan portfolio and are not additional to this amount.It is important to note that this information is provisional in nature and final figures and further detailed statistics will not be available until a loan by loan assessment has been undertaken.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	453	When I initially announced, on 7 April, the Government's intention to establish NAMA, I indicated that the potential maximum book value of loans for transfer to the agency was estimated to be in the region of €80 to €90 billion.  Since then, it has repeatedly been made clear, including on my Department's website and the NAMA website, that this was an indicative figure and that further detailed work and extensive due diligence on the loans books would be needed before final figures could be announced.Since April, a substantial amount of work and analysis has been undertaken by the interim NAMA.  In light of this work, it is now expected that NAMA will purchase loans with a book value of approximately €77 billion from certain institutions.  Again I would emphasise that the final figure will not be available until a loan by loan evaluation had been completed.The current estimate of €77 billion takes account of the decision that a €5 million threshold should apply to loans on the books of the larger banks.  The application of this €5 million threshold is expected to generate significant operational efficiencies for NAMA.

This was done by the enacting of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 and the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 last June.  This measure has had a very significant effect in providing reassurance to credit union members that their savings are secure.The next step is for me, as Minister for Finance, to make an order under section 12(2) of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 bringing section 4 of the Act, dealing with the amount to be held in the Deposit Protection Account, into operation for credit unions.  The Department is considering this in consultation with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and a decision will be taken as soon as possible.Alongside my announcement of 20 September 2008, I indicated that it was intended that the guarantee which was being announced for credit institution savers would act as a backstop to an approved stabilisation scheme for credit unions.  I believe that approved stabilisation arrangements are important to the continued stability of the credit union movement as they will act as the first port of call in the event of a credit union experiencing significant financial stress.  My Department will, of course, continue to work with the Registrar and the representative bodies to support the achievement of this objective.The legal framework governing the regulation of credit unions is provided by the Credit Union Act 1997.  The Act has served credit unions well providing stability and legal certainty during a period of substantial growth and development of the movement.  As a result of this development and changes in the financial environment generally, the need for some modernisation of the legislative and regulatory framework for credit unions has become evident over time.  There is consensus among all stakeholders that the current legislative framework needs reform.  While some important preparatory work has already been carried out in this regard there is, however, no clear consensus at this stage on the future shape of the reformed legislative framework for credit unions.  I have asked the Chair of the Financial Regulator to initiate a review of credit unions which it is hoped will make an important contribution to identifying the appropriate way forward.

Data on mortgage defaults is not compiled by the Financial Regulator on a routine basis.  However, in December 2008, the Financial Regulator published the findings of an examination of procedures for handling arrears and repossessions across credit institutions and other mortgage lenders. This examination showed that at end June 2008, 13,931 mortgage accounts (1.44% of residential accounts at end June 2008) were over 3 months in arrears, compared with end December 2006 when there were 11,252 accounts over 3 months in arrears (1.21% of residential accounts at end 2006).In relation to the foreclosure rate the Courts Service only hold data on the number of court repossession orders granted. Orders for repossession do not, of course, necessarily equate with actual repossessions. It is up to the person or company which obtained the order for repossession to pursue its execution. Notwithstanding this, the aforementioned December 2008 report of the Financial Regulator found that between January 2005 and June 2008 credit institutions repossessed 112 residential properties.  Other mortgage lenders repossessed 16 properties in that time period.  In total, there were 128 repossessions by court order for the period January 2005 to June 2008 out of a total of almost 1 million mortgage accounts reported to be held at end June 2008.The Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) has confirmed that, with respect to its members, 96 repossessions took place in 2008, which represents 0.01% of all mortgages. In the first 6 months of 2009 70 repossessions have taken place.

Tables setting out details on property yields were included in the supplementary documentation circulated to Deputies at the beginning of the Second Stage debate on the NAMA Bill. The figures show that yields are moving towards being 2% higher than their long term averages, and more in some cases.  While this is above the long term average, it is obviously considerably higher than yield figures at the peak of the market, which were at an all time low.

If a profit is generated by Anglo, this would be retained initially to reinforce Anglo's capital position rather than paying a dividend. As part of the terms of the capital provision, Anglo will prepare a restructuring plan which will examine all options for the future of the bank, and which will address the issue of compensatory measures for the capital provision.Any possible further capital requirement by Anglo will be determined by the extent of impairment on the bank's loan book and by the precise terms of the expected transfer of €28 billion of Anglo loans to NAMA. Work related to both of these aspects is currently ongoing. When this work is complete, I will be in a position to make an estimate of Anglo's future capital needs and any capacity there is to generate capital internally.The Government remains committed to providing institutions participating in NAMA, which includes Anglo, with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements. Of course this would be done in a manner that is consistent with EU State aid rules and the credit needs of the economy.

The undertaking of a future liability management exercise is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Board of the bank on a commercial basis, taking into account the overall funding and capital implications of such an exercise for the bank.Anglo's subordinated debt is publicly traded and is dealt through clearing house systems. As an issuer, Anglo does not have access to the records of those clearing systems, and does not have a means of establishing the underlying ownership of its subordinated bonds at any given time. Unlike in the case of shares, the holders of listed debt instruments are not subject under company law to a disclosure regime.Anglo is aware that its former chairman, Sean Fitzpatrick, purchased a beneficial interest in certain debt instruments of the Bank during 2008, at which time the price of the debt instruments involved was higher than that paid under the bank's recent debt buy back exercise. A specific disclosure on this holding was made in note 50 of Anglo's annual accounts for 30 September 2008.Dated subordinated debt issued on or after the commencement date of the new draft Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme will not be guaranteed either under the ELG Scheme or under the current Credit Institutions Financial Support (CIFS) Scheme. However, dated subordinated debt already guaranteed under the CIFS Scheme will remain guaranteed under the CIFS Scheme due to the irrevocable nature of the CIFS guarantee.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I would point out that any proposed changes in VAT must be considered in the context of EU law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of a reduced VAT rate, or an exemption from VAT, on supplies of goods or services based on their environmental impact per se.  While Member States can retain the zero rating provisions which they had in existence on 1 January 1991, they cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible for Ireland to apply a zero rate to micro wind turbines.The supply of certain environmental products, such as insulation materials, wind turbine equipment, wood pellet boilers and solar panels, are chargeable at the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21.5%.  However, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% may be applied to such products where they are provided under a single supply and install contract where the VAT exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT exclusive charge to the customer.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the current VAT classifications with a view to reducing the rate of VAT applied to certain environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5%.  While the scope for reduced rates is limited, the Finance Act 2008 provided for the VAT rate applicable on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar goods used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels being reduced from 21% to 13.5%.  This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.I would draw to your attention that the EU Commission recently undertook a study of the possibility of using reduced VAT rates as a tool to support the climate change agenda. Ireland expressed support for such a study.  However, at a recent Council of Finance Ministers meeting, the Ministers noted that reduced VAT rates as a tool for achieving environmental policy objectives are relevant only to a certain extent.

However the lump sum costs arising in respect of my Department and bodies under its aegis are as set out in the following table.In addition to the recently announced Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (ISER) there are a number of other arrangements which make provision for retirement earlier than normal pension age in certain circumstances.  These are:CNER Arrangements for cost-neutral early retirement which allows staff who are within ten years of their normal pension age to apply for early retirement with immediate payment of their superannuation benefits.  The benefits are actuarially reduced to ensure that the early payment is cost-neutral to the Exchequer.Retirement before normal pension age with immediate payment of superannuation benefits may be permitted on medical grounds.Superannuation benefits may also be paid to a Civil Servant before normal pension age as a consequence of the abolition of his or her post or removal from office to facilitate improvements in the organisation of the Department by which greater efficiency and economy can be affected.YearRetirementsCost of Lump sumsResignedCostContract terminatedCost20064466,299600020073731,672900020084298,76430002009 to date11168,9851000TOTAL221,665,72040000Commission on Public Service AppointmentsYearRetirementsLump Sum CostResignedCostContract terminatedCost20060000200700002008000020091€10,535.970000YearRetirementsLump Sum CostResignationsCostContracts terminatedCost€02006173,675.63020071107,905.8702008001002009165,441.490TOTAL3247,022.99Nil00YearRetirementsLump Sum CostResignedCostContract terminatedCost2006050002007253,288.912000200803000200901000TOTAL253,288.9111000YearRetirementsLump Sum CostResignedCostContract terminatedCost2006252,732,777510202007393,498,623800402008312,634,77048040200914721797386010TOTAL24211,045,9081850110At the time of reply details were unavailable for a small number of bodies under the remit of the Department.

It is important to note that the establishment of NAMA is in no way intended to protect or bailout borrowers. The amount a borrower owes will not change because of the transfer of a loan to NAMA. The NAMA Bill provides the Agency with a wide range of powers it needs to pursue borrowers and enforce security. The Agency will have a statutory duty to maximise the return on the loans transferred in the interest of taxpayers and will be expected to use all the powers available to it to achieve this objective.It is intended a minimum threshold of €5m will apply to certain loans eligible for transfer to NAMA. It is proposed currently that this limitation will apply only to certain of the larger institutions that have indicated they will apply to be designated as participating institutions. The application of this €5m threshold is expected to generate significant efficiencies for NAMA while ensuring the goal of cleansing the balance sheets of participating institutions is achieved. Loans below the €5 million threshold will continue to be managed in the normal manner by the institutions concerned.

In the context of the 2010 Estimates process, Government Departments have been asked by my Department to identify options for making the necessary expenditure savings, taking into account the Special Group's proposals and any additional or alternative options of their own.  However, decisions on all such options will be taken for the Government.Similarly, the Commission on Taxation has prepared a Report setting out its recommendations for structural reforms in the taxation system, and the implementation of these recommendations will be a matter for Government to consider in the context of the annual budgetary process.As regards the role of State bodies in this overall process, relevant bodies would be expected to contribute their views and analysis to inform the consideration of options by Departments, under whose aegis they operate, and in turn by the Government. More generally, State bodies are subject to oversight by the relevant Government Departments as regards their activities and expenditure, and are accountable to Dáil Éireann.  Any specific queries or concerns about the use of public funds by particular public bodies would be a matter for the relevant Government Department to deal with in the first instance.  Consequently, I have no plans for a circular at this stage although I take the point the Deputy is making.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 363 together.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax, it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy.I have also been informed that no general research has been carried out recently by either the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners regarding the extent and breakdown of wealth as opposed to income.  I have no immediate plans to carry out such a study.  However, it should be noted that all of an individual's assets and liabilities are declared in a number of specific circumstances — for example:after the death of an individual, on an Inland Revenue Affidavit, which is a document that is required to be delivered to the Revenue Commissioners and certified by them in order to obtain a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration; orif an individual is required to submit a Statement of Affairs in the context of an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners.In addition, an individual is asked to list chargeable assets acquired and disposed of during a year on their annual tax return.  Asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances, they may have declined considerably in many cases.  Thus, if the value of an asset or of an individual's wealth is measured at a particular time there is no guarantee that the asset value or the individual's wealth will remain at that level or increase from that point.Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company when they dispose of an asset (CGT) or acquire an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  The rate of both these taxes was increased to 25% in the last Budget and Finance Act.  All taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.

Given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such new rates could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.  These figures are provisional and likely to be revised.

For example, the tax returns incorporating 2008 claims for tax relief on pension contributions to personal pension plans such as RACs and PRSAs are not due to be returned by taxpayers until the end of this month. The following table provides a breakdown of the estimated cost of tax and PRSI reliefs for private pension provision for 2007, the latest year for which the most up-to-date data is available.

If relief for these deductions and reliefs was confined to the standard rate of income tax the saving to the Exchequer could be of the order of  €1,100 million.This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a change or the economic effect of such a change.

The life insurance levy was only introduced part-way through 2009.  At the time of the Supplementary Budget, the estimated full year impact on the Exchequer from the withdrawal of the life insurance levy is €140 million.  The estimated full year impact on the Exchequer from the withdrawal of the non-life insurance levy is €107 million. The estimated full year impact on the Exchequer from the withdrawal of stamp duty on insurance policies, other than life assurance policies, is €2 million.It should be noted that a private health insurance levy introduced in the new health insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, is balanced by a new tax relief at source in respect for persons aged over 50 with health insurance.  The overall impact of this measure on the Exchequer is intended to be revenue neutral.

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.The full year yield to the Exchequer arising from reducing the earnings cap to the amount mentioned in the question is estimated as follows:Proposed Earnings CapEstimated Exchequer Yield€€m100,00085A breakdown of the figures by reference to income levels is available only in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) to the extent that these contributions are included in the personal tax returns of tax payers.With regard to occupational pensions, (that is, schemes set up by the employer), the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to associate contributions with individual income levels. For that reason the estimated yield to the Exchequer in respect of these contributions is extremely tentative.The estimated yield is based on assuming that tax relief which would be affected by the changes mentioned in the question is currently allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and at the maximum age-related percentage limit of earnings. The figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer yield in respect of those taxpayers.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	491	It is assumed the Deputy is referring to Betting Duty. The amount of Betting Duty paid in 2008 was €36.6m and the estimated yield in 2009 is around €31m. As the rate of Betting Duty in those years was 1 per cent, one could at first glance assume that the yield from a 10 per cent rate would be in the order of ten times those amounts. However, such a figure would not be realised. It is likely that a Betting Duty rate of 10 per cent would have a detrimental affect on the betting industry.As the Deputy may be aware, due to pressure on the betting sector, I decided to defer the introduction of the increase in the betting duty provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 pending a review. Accordingly, the Finance Act 2009 contains a provision for continuing the existing betting duty rate of 1% unless and until an order is made bringing the 2% rate into effect, or alternative betting  taxation arrangements are enacted. This decision is based on the premise that the betting sector will engage in constructive discussions about putting in place a fair and workable tax base for the sector.  Such discussions will, inter alia, touch on issues such as online/phone betting, which is largely untaxed, and look at proposals that could potentially bring this area into the tax net, if possible, while also protecting Irish employment in the sector.To this end my officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in the area of internet gambling and will continue to do so, on an ongoing basis.In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has initiated a review in order to provide the Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing gambling architecture in the State. The review, amongst other things, will consider:the recommendations contained in the Report Regulating Gaming in Ireland,the existing law regulating gaming lotteries and other forms of gambling in the jurisdiction,international developments, in particular the experience of the UK's Gambling Commission,developments in relation to remote gambling (e.g. via the internet and mobile phones).

In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution and, in such circumstances, increasing the rate could lead to a reduction in yield from the tax.

In computing the net amount of the rents received, only those deductions that are specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are allowable. The main deductible expenses are:Any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;The cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;The cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;Interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property; andPayment of local authority rates in the case of rateable properties used for commercial purposes.As payment of the new local authority charge for residential properties is not included on the list of allowable deductions, it is not an allowable expense in computing taxable rental income.

I do not accept that Government support of an institution provides any argument in favour of any particular group. In fact, taxpayers will naturally look to bank employees to understand and respond to the financial situation in which these institutions find themselves. Jobs in the financial sector are now being protected by enormous taxpayer support and while ordinary financial sector workers are not to blame for this situation, they are getting more assistance than many other workers in other sectors. While I will not be participating in the negotiation process in relation to this dispute, either directly or by seeking to influence directors, and am not giving an opinion on the merits of this particular case, I feel this general background must be borne in mind by financial sector employees generally.

Ministers may available of the options (iii) and (iv) above under the SSA scheme.There are three options for Senators under the SSA scheme: either   (i) Parliamentary Secretaries supplied and employed by the Oireachtas Commission; or  (ii) a fully vouched annual amount of up to €20,546 for employing a temporary staff member or for the purchase of secretarial equipment and services; or   (iii) a Parliamentary Secretary employed at 75% supplied and paid for by the Oireachtas Commission and an annual un-vouched amount of €6,666.The Oireachtas Commission made proposals to me about the system of expense allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas including the application of the SSA scheme. The proposals were an attempt by the Commission to provide a more streamlined expenses system and the introduction of a single composite allowance in place of the existing separate allowances.I have introduced enabling legislation which would allow the proposals of the Commission in regard to a composite allowance to be implemented. The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 2009 provides for the introduction of a single composite allowance for Deputies and Senators to be known as the Parliamentary Standard Allowance.However, I am of the view there is a need for further consideration and discussion of the proposed composite allowance before it is introduced in any regulations.

A Disciplinary Code for civil servants is set out in Circular 14/2006: Civil Service Disciplinary Code revised in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005.The Code came into effect on 4 July 2006 and replaced the previous Code as set out in Circular 1/92. The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 allows certain provisions contained in the Public Service Management Act 1997 to take effect.  The 2005 Act gives each Secretary General/Head of Scheduled Office, as appropriate authority, responsibility for managing all matters relating to performance, conduct and discipline of civil servants below Principal Officer level. Ministers continue to be the appropriate authority for these matters in relation to civil servants at or above Principal level in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005. The code is available on the personnel code website: www.personnelcode.gov.ie.Specific arrangements apply to disciplinary matters affecting employees in other areas of the public service and these are the prime responsibility of the relevant Ministers. For instance, procedures for the suspension and dismissal of teachers have recently been agreed and these are available from the Department of Education and Science.Guidelines are available on the contracts, remuneration and other conditions of chief executives and senior management of commercial state bodies. The guidelines are available on my Department's website — www.finance.gov.ie.Contracts for Chief Executives of individual non-commercial state bodies contain provisions relating to circumstances in which the employment of the chief executive may be terminated. The circumstances in which employment may be terminated normally include misconduct or gross default affecting the business of the Body concerned, bankruptcy, incapacitation and conviction of a criminal offence, other than an offence which in the opinion of the Body concerned does not affect the position as chief executive.As regards severance/early retirement arrangements for chief executive officers, there are guidelines set out in the letter to all Heads of Departments of 26 May 1998.  The provisions in that letter may be applicable where the board and the responsible Minister consider that a fresh approach is needed in the interest of the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization.  A copy of the letter is as follows:Ref: P18/126/98
26 May 1998To: All Heads of DepartmentA Chara,
Severance and Early Retirement for Chief Executives of State Sponsored Bodies
1. I am directed by the Minister for Finance to say that he has considered the issue of severance/early retirement payments for Chief Executives of State Sponsored Bodies (SSBs). This consideration has had particular regard to the fact that it is becoming more common for Chief Executive Officers of State Sponsored Bodies to be employed on fixed term contracts, and that there may be times when the  Board of a State Sponsored Body and the relevant Minister may conclude that it is in the best interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of the SSB concerned to terminate or not to renew the contract of an incumbent CEO. This need not necessarily arise as a result of any dissatisfaction with the performance of the individual concerned, but perhaps because a new and fresh approach needs to be introduced. In such circumstances, the Minister will not object to the application of special early retirement/severance provisions, subject to certain conditions and safeguards.2. The Minister has therefore decided that this Department will not object to the making of severance payments or grant of early retirement terms to Chief Executives of State Bodies within the following maximum limits and subject to the conditions specified, from a current date. Departments may deal with cases within the guidelines and limits without reference to this Department except where such reference is specifically required (drafts of any consequent changes in the relevant pension schemes would need to be cleared in the normal way).a) Payment of pension and lump sum, based on actual reckonable pensionable service, increased as appropriate in accordance with paragraph (b) following, may be allowed at age 55 for a CEO who retires from that position, who has served at least 6 years in that capacity and who has at least 15 years actual service overall in the public sector only service with the body from which the CEO is retiring or service which has been transferred into the scheme of that body may reckon.b) In determining the pension and lump sum to be paid, one added year of pensionable service may be granted for each year in excess of 15 years overall actual service in the public sector1 (i.e. including service in capacities other than as a CEO) subject to a maximum of 5 added years;c) Actuarially reduced benefits may be made available without age restriction — this means that a person might receive a pension benefit or lump sum before age 55, provided that the cost of providing these benefits at the earlier age are entirely offset by a reduction in the amount of benefits payable: the amount of such reduction would require to be determined by the relevant scheme's actuaries;d) Where an immediate pension (other than on an actuarially reduced basis) is not payable, a severance payment of four weeks pay per year of continuous service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks pay, may be made. However, where pension becomes payable within 26 weeks of retirement, the amount of the severance should be reduced to the amount of salary which would have been payable between the date of retirement and commencement of pension.3. Application of the foregoing terms would be strictly conditional on completion of contract, unless the Board, in agreement with the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance, decides to terminate the CEO's employment before the termination of the contract. It is not therefore appropriate to make such payments where the initiative for the termination of a contract comes from the CEO concerned.4. Application of these terms would also be conditional on there being no re-employment, direct or indirect, of the individual concerned by the body from which s/he is retiring, or another public sector body in the same sector.5. Where subsequent employment is obtained in the public sector such that pension plus pay in the new job exceeds the equivalent of the retirement salary on the basis of which the pension is payable, then pension will be abated to bring the total down to the level of that salary. This abatement will not apply in relation to work after age 65. Where pension rights are acquired in respect of post-retirement work, the original pension (if based on actual service plus added years) would be reduced and based on actual service only. In such circumstances the uprated portion of the lump sum attributable to the added years would be required to be repaid. It should be explicitly stated that any grant of early retirement terms would be subject to these conditions.6. The terms set out above are intended to be maximum ones, and a Board would be free to apply lesser benefits or not to apply early retirement benefits at all. Early retirement benefits might be denied, for example, if the Board wanted the contract renewed for a further term. It is not, therefore, intended to interfere with the freedom of Boards in this area, but rather to indicate the maximum limits which the Minister would be prepared to approve.7. Adjustment to the terms set out above will be necessary where a retiring CEO has already availed of a severance or early retirement package from a public sector body, and in such cases this Department should be consulted.8. The arrangements set out in this letter should be allowed strictly on the basis, accepted in writing by the CEO, that they are in full and final settlement of any claim which the CEO may have in relation to the early retirement or termination or non-renewal of a contract.9. The Minister does not anticipate approving any improvement on the terms set out above, even in individual exceptional cases, other than on foot of a Government decision.10. It is essential that Departments should convey to the Pensions Section of this Department details of each case dealt with under the terms of this letter. The contact point in this Department for telephone queries is Mr. Kevin Cardiff at (01) 604-5476.Yours sincerely,John HurleySecretary General, Public Service Management and Development.An Roinn AirgeadaisDepartment of FinanceRef: P18/126/984 June 1998To: All Heads of DepartmentA Chara,
Severance and Early Retirement for Chief Executives of State Sponsored Bodies
I am directed by the Minister for Finance to refer to this Department's letter of 26 May 1998, in regard to the above. For the purposes of clarification, Departments should note that the grant of added years in accordance with paragraph 2(b) of that letter is subject to the following conditions, in accordance with the normal practice in relation to such added years, viz.i. A person may not receive a greater number of added years than the additional service s/he would have if s/he served to his/her maximum retirement age. Thus a person retiring from a CEO position at 63 cannot receive more than 2 additional years service.ii. The grant of additional pensionable service may not lead to a person having more than the maximum pensionable service for the relevant pension scheme (i.e. 40 years in most cases).Yours sincerelyKevin Cardiff
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	503	In the civil and public service, Cost Neutral Early Retirement (CNER) has been available since 1 April 2004 for individuals who wish to retire with immediate pension up to 10 years before normal retirement age.  More recently, the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) has been available.  The procedures and circumstances whereby these arrangements may be availed of are set out in Circulars 10 of 2005 (CNER) and 12 of 2009 (ISER).  Civil and public service superannuation schemes provide for early retirement on grounds of ill-health, which may include some additional years of notional service, depending on age and service.There are specific early retirement provisions in various areas of the Public service.  Gardaí, prison officers and psychiatric nurses who are not new entrants as defined in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 may retire on reaching the age of 50 if they have 30 years of service.  This means that they have qualified for full pension entitlements because under their schemes each year of service in excess of 20 years reckons as 2 years of service for pension purposes.  Primary and secondary school teachers may retire on or after age 55 if they have 35 years of service.  In the Defence forces, officers who are not new entrants under the 2004 Act may retire with immediate pension after 12 years service regardless of age and similar enlisted personnel may retire with immediate pension after 21 years service also regardless of age.Section 6 of the Superannuation Act 1909 and sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 set out rules governing early retirement of civil servants as a consequence of abolition of office or for the purposes of facilitating improvements in the organisation of the department in order to effect greater efficiency and economy.  Section 6 of the 1909 Act allows for the immediate payment of pension on retiring.  Section 6 of the 1963 Act allows for the addition of up to 10 years of notional service and section 7 of that Act allows for the grant of a special severance gratuity of up to one-half of annual salary.  In the wider public service the provisions of the 1909 and 1963 Acts serve as guidelines in dealing with similar cases.  In operating these provisions, the practice in the main is not to grant additional years of notional service and a severance payment to any one individual.The Government agreed that these provisions could apply in the case of Secretaries General who retire on completion of their contracts with the addition of up to 10 years of notional service and up to 6 months pay in severance regardless of age.  Similar provisions are included in the Local Government Superannuation Scheme in relation to County Managers.For full-time board members and equivalent positions in the Competition Authority, Labour Court, Environmental Protection Agency and Bord Pleanála retirement is normally between age 60 and 65; however, members who have their appointment terminated (other than for stated misconduct), or are not re-appointed on expiration of their period of office, are entitled to immediate pension and lump sum where they have accrued more than two years' service. Preservation of benefits applies only in case of voluntary resignation after two or more years' service.The Department of Finance letter of 26 May 1998 to all Heads of Departments sets out the enhanced retirement/severance terms for chief executive officers of non-commercial semi-State bodies whose contracts are not renewed or are terminated, and the conditions under which they may be made available.  Such non-renewal or termination might arise where the board and Minister conclude that there is a need for a fresh approach in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness of the organization.  As regards this letter about CEOs, consideration will be given to the possible need for clarification of the terms provided for and the conditions attaching to them.It is not possible to cover all the early retirement arrangements across the public service.  The Deputy might wish to consult respective Ministers about specific circumstances pertaining to agencies and bodies under their aegis.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	507	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.The ECCE scheme is a general one and services participating will be required to make reasonable accommodation for children with special needs in accordance with the Equal Status Acts 2000 and 2004.  However, the scheme takes account of a number of issues to accommodate children with special needs.While the age range in which children will qualify for the scheme is, generally, between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September each year, exceptions to the upper age limit will be considered where a child cannot start primary school until s/he is more than 5 years 6 months of age, due to either being assessed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being developmentally delayed or having a physical or sensory disability which prevents the child from availing of age-appropriate education.  In such cases, the pre-school year relevant to such children will be taken as their qualifying year.To apply for an exemption to be made on either of these grounds, a letter should be forwarded to the Childcare Directorate in my Office stating the reasons for the exception sought.  The letter should be accompanied by a copy of the child's birth certificate, details of his or her Personal Public Service (PPS) number and the name and address of the pre-school service in which s/he will be enrolled.  In addition, the letter should be accompanied either by a supporting assessment report from the HSE or, where relevant, by a letter from the Principal of the local primary school confirming the age admissions policy applied. as having a special need which will delay his or her entry to primary school.  Given the timeframe available before the introduction of the first period of free pre-school provision in January next, it is accepted that not all parents will have had time to apply for and receive an assessment report in advance of this date.  To accommodate parents in this position, a professional assessment other than from the HSE may be accepted.  This would not include assessments provided, for example, by a General Practitioner.Additionally, the general requirement that a child would be expected to attend 4 or 5 days each week will not apply to children with special needs where a shorter week would be more appropriate to their needs.  Many specialist pre-school services arrange for children attending their services to also attend a mainstream service for 1, 2, or 3 days a week and this will continue to be facilitated under the ECCE.  In the case in question, I understand that the reason for shorter hours of attendance at pre-school will arise from the fact that a Special Needs Assistant will be available to the child for less than the 15 hours per week available under the ECCE.  While I regret that this will be the case, I would point out that attendance for the full period of provision each week is not compulsory and no child, particularly in the circumstances outlined, will be precluded from availing of his or her pre-school place on this basis.

While I am not aware of any specific case of re-labelling poultry and poultry products which were originally sourced in the UK,  under  Council Directive 2000/13/EC, it is permissible to state, under country of origin labelling, the country in which the product  last underwent a substantial, economically justified, transformation.In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals on updating and harmonising this legislation. The proposal is still under discussion. The new labelling proposal, however, states that, in the event of the country of origin being stated on the label, the place of birth, rearing and slaughter of the animal, where different from the country of origin  must also be stated.  Legal advice provided to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland confirms that it is permissible for food produced in Northern Ireland to be labelled as Irish.

To date, the Minister has signed three commencement orders in respect of the Act.The first of these was signed on the 3rd July and enabled the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to immediately commence price negotiations with private nursing homes.The second was signed on the 21st September and commenced the new care representative appointment process from the 5th October.  This allows people to apply to the Circuit Court for appointment as a care representative from that date where they wish to request the Nursing Home Loan on behalf of an applicant with reduced capacity.A third commencement order was signed on the 28th September and enables the HSE to prescribe forms for the purposes of the scheme. As of yesterday, the application form and information booklet for the scheme are available to the public and may be obtained from the HSE.  This will enable people to familiarise themselves with the application form and process, gather necessary information and generally prepare themselves so that they are ready to apply when the scheme is introduced.Finally, the Minister announced yesterday that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will commence on the 27th October 2009 and intends to sign an order commencing all remaining sections of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 with effect from that date.

I understand that recent research points to difficulties in other jurisdictions where mandatory reporting was introduced.The Implementation Plan approved by Government in response to the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse identifies the need for legislation to provide that staff employed by the State and in agencies in receipt of funding from the Exchequer will have:a duty to comply with the Children First national guidelines;a duty to share relevant information in the best interests of the childa duty to co-operate with other relevant services in the best interests of the child.It is intended that this legislation will be drafted by December 2010.A revised edition of Children First Guidelines will be published by the end of this year. Children First Guidelines are national over-arching guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies that are dealing with children.  They are intended to support and guide health professionals, teachers, and members of the Garda Síochána and the many people in sporting, cultural, community and voluntary organisations who come into regular contact with children.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I propose to take Questions Nos. 424 and 427 together.I have no plans to introduce a population-based screening programme for prostate cancer at this time.  The available international evidence does not indicate that such a programme would be effective in reducing mortality.  For this reason the National Cancer Control Strategy (2006) did not recommend the introduction of a population based screening programme for prostate cancer.  This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which indicate that cancer screening programmes should be introduced only when they have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to expert medical evidence.  My Department and the National Cancer Screening Service will keep emerging international evidence under review, including the results of randomised trials that are currently being conducted internationally.The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) is working to enhance access to early diagnosis and multi-disciplinary decision-making for prostate cancer.  I am pleased to say that Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Clinics are being established in each of the eight cancer centres designated under the NCCP.  Patients at higher risk will be fast-tracked to these clinics, and those patients who receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer will have immediate access to a multidisciplinary specialist cancer consultation regarding appropriate management.The first two Rapid Access clinics have opened at University Hospital Galway (UHG) and St. James's Hospital, Dublin, with two more (St. Vincent's and Beaumont) to be established later this year and a further four in 2010.Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP for appropriate referral.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The Adoption Bill, 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad and I am actively seeking time for its progression in the current Dáil session.  I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  This applies in the case of adoptions from Ethiopia and other countries who have not, as yet, ratified the Hague Convention, and would seem unlikely to do so in the immediate future.  Only adoptions effected before the commencement of the Act can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I propose to take Questions Nos. 430 and 580 together.The Government's focus is to achieve fair access by patients to publicly-funded hospital capacity based on medical need.  The new consultants' contract includes new measures designed to progress this, for example, through the operation of one-for-all outpatient and ambulatory diagnostic clinics, a key entry point to hospital care.  There are also clear new rules on consultants' public-private mix of patients and new measures to manage these rules by newly appointed clinical directors.  These contractual features complement existing ‘bed designation' rules, set out as follows.Although patients may be treated in public hospitals on a private basis, the core purpose of the public hospital system is to provide services for all patients under the statutory eligibility provisions.  All persons ordinarily resident in Ireland have full eligibility for hospital services, meaning there is universal access to public hospital care. The fact that a person may have private health insurance does not take away from his/her eligibility for services as a public patient.Bed designation was introduced as part of the mechanism to control the level of private activity in publicly funded hospitals and to help ensure equitable access for public patients.  Under the Health (In-Patient) Regulations 1991, beds in public hospitals are categorised as public, private or non-designated.  Under these Regulations no private patient being admitted electively may be accommodated in a designated public bed.  Similarly no private patient admitted as an emergency may be accommodated in a designated public bed unless (and only for such time as) a designated private bed is not available.  The Regulations contain reciprocal provisions regarding the accommodation of public patients in beds designated as private.Thus, there are limits provided for, and implemented, on the usage of publicly-funded hospital capacity for private activity.  The absence of such limits — even if the economic cost of private activity were fully recouped — would create an unacceptable incentive for both consultants and hospitals to maximise private activity, which, while certainly generating income for public-contract holding consultants and for public hospitals, could only be at the expense of fair access for public patients.  Indeed, it would call into question why Exchequer funds were allocated for such hospital capacity at all.It is important that the application of these Regulations and the operation of the mixed public/private hospital system supports the achievement of Government policy on fair access for public patients.  I have no plans, therefore, to enable the HSE to levy an accommodation charge in respect of the situations referred to by the Deputy as I believe it would be contrary to the fundamental purpose of public hospital services.With the support of my Department, the HSE is working to improve business processes for collecting outstanding debts due from private health insurers in respect of patients using private facilities in public hospitals.  This includes engagement with private health insurers.  The HSE has also drawn up proposals for centralising the management of patient debts and other income.  Earlier this year the VHI agreed to make a payment of €50m towards outstanding debts.  This was in response to an initiative that I undertook to enable the HSE to implement its National Service Plan for 2009.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I have emphasised to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) the need for maximum cost-effectiveness in the discharge of its remit, consistent with providing safe and effective care, and I am satisfied that the Fund is aware of its responsibilities in this regard.  I have also asked the NTPF, in its dealings with private hospitals, to seek even better value in the current year and the Fund indicates that it has already succeeded in negotiating reductions in the prices paid for certain high-volume procedures.   The Fund has also stated that where acceptable prices cannot be agreed, it will not purchase the required service from the provider concerned.The NTPF uses a number of benchmarks in determining whether the prices offered by private providers represent value for money.  These include public hospital average case mix costs and, where known, the prices paid by private health insurers.  The NTPF has undertaken a comparison of the average price it has paid for certain high-volume procedures with the public hospital average case mix cost for similar treatments.  While it is not appropriate to draw a direct comparison between the price charged by a private hospital for a procedure and the average public hospital case mix cost, the NTPF indicates that for the treatments in question there is a reasonable correlation in average costs. In some cases the price paid by the NTPF is appreciably lower than the average case mix cost in the public hospital system.In his Annual Report for 2008, having reviewed the relevant NTPF records, the Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that most procedures purchased from private hospitals by the NTPF cost less than the case mix-adjusted benchmark cost in the public hospital system. The initial cost payable for these procedures is necessarily set on the basis of complication-free surgery. In general, the samples examined suggest that cost uplifts are limited to cases requiring additional clinical care, the need for which was not apparent when the treatment was contracted for.

The new facility will provide accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients with appropriate isolation facilities for the treatment of their condition.  It will also include a dedicated day unit for people with cystic fibrosis.The HSE, in partnership with St. Vincent's Hospital, structured the tender for this development in such a way that payments for the works can be deferred towards the end of the construction period.  A contract has recently been awarded by the hospital to begin the site preparation work.  In the interim tender documents are being completed for the development in order to ensure earliest possible commencement of construction in 2010.  It is intended that the development will become operational as early as possible in 2011.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I propose to take Questions Nos. 435 and 519 together.I have considered all the relevant advice available to me in relation to the potential public health benefits of HPV vaccination in the prevention of cervical cancer and the wider policy implications for its possible introduction into the National Immunisation Programme. I accept the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence. All of the clinical advice available to me indicates that, in the context of the limited resources available, the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme should take precedence over the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme.The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has completed an assessment of the cost effectiveness of HPV. It shows that the vaccine does have the potential to play an important long term role in the prevention of cervical cancer and that a vaccination programme should be put in place to enable these long term benefits to be realised.Accordingly, in August 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) was requested by the Department to examine operational and procurement issues relating to the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme for 12 year old girls on a basis that would achieve maximum cost effectiveness and appropriate national uptake rates.I am keeping the cost of implementing such a programme under review.  I am committed to progressively introducing cancer prevention measures, such as new screening and vaccination programmes, according to clinical prioritisation within resources available.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I propose to take Questions Nos. 440, 464, 508 and 572, together.The Minister announced yesterday that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will commence on the 27th October 2009.  The legislation providing for the scheme was signed into law on the 1st July 2009. Certain sections of the Act were commenced on the 3rd July to enable the National Treatment Purchase Fund to immediately begin price negotiations with private nursing homes. This work, which must be completed before the scheme can commence, is almost concluded.The Minster is aware of the effect of the delay in introducing the new scheme on nursing home residents and is anxious to ensure that they benefit from the scheme as soon as possible. For this reason, she commenced two particular elements of the legislation which will allow people to prepare in advance so that they are ready to apply on the 27th October.Firstly, as of the 5th October, the new care representative appointment process has commenced.  This allows people to apply to the Circuit Court for appointment as a care representative from that date where they wish to apply for the Nursing Home Loan on behalf of an applicant with reduced capacity.In addition, the Minister signed an order enabling the HSE to prescribe forms for the purposes of the scheme. The application form and information booklet for the scheme are now available to the public and may be obtained from the HSE.  This will enable people to familiarise themselves with the application form and process, gather necessary information and generally prepare themselves so that they are ready to apply on the 27th October when the scheme is introduced.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	555	As the Deputy will be aware, the new Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which provides a free Pre-School year to eligible children and which will be introduced in January 2010, was announced in the Supplementary Budget in April this year. Since the announcement of the scheme I have had a number of meetings with the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations, which represent the views of child care service providers throughout the country, and also with individual childcare providers. I have also listened carefully to the views of parents and where possible have made modifications to the scheme to address issues which have been raised.In relation to the age range for eligibility which includes children aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September each year, it has been agreed to interpret the application of the age range as generously as possible to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months  and less than 4 years 7 months on the 1 September. This will mean that children born on or between 2 February 2005 and 30 June 2006 will be eligible to enter the scheme in January 2010 and in September 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2006 or on or before 30 June 2007 will qualify, and so on in subsequent years.The options available to pre-school services as to how they deliver the pre-school year was raised with my Office and has been responded to by allowing for a wider range of options.  Full or part-time day care services can provide the pre-school year for 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks (241 days) per year, in return for the capitation fee of €48.50 per week.  In addition, they can also apply to provide the pre-school year for 3 hours and 45 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 50 weeks per year.A play-school sessional service will, normally, provide the pre-school year for 3 hours per day, 5 days a week for 38 weeks (183 days) per year, in return for a capitation fee of €64.50 per week. However, where for good reason a sessional service is unable to operate over 5 days, it will be allowed to provide the pre-school year for 3 hours 30 minutes per day for 4 days per week over 41 weeks (157 days). Further flexibility is provided for in that, a full or part-time service may choose to provide a sessional service over 38 weeks of a year (or 2 sessional services each day) while a sessional service may choose to provide 2 hours 15 minutes per day over 50 weeks.The issue of commercial rates on pre-school services was also raised. In July of this year the Valuation Office, which is responsible for implementing the Valuation Act 2001, clarified that the ECCE will result in certain services being considered exempt from commercial rates. Services covered by this exemption must be participating in the ECCE and solely and exclusively used for the provision of educational services which are available to the general public. In addition, the expenses incurred in providing the service must be defrayed wholly or mainly by the State. The legal position for services not covered by the exemption is unchanged and rateable status of community services will continue to be dealt with on a case by case basis on the grounds of charitable status as provided for under Schedule 4 Item 16 of the Valuation Act.Some service providers expressed the view that the capitation of €64.50 (€2,450 p.a.) a week provided for under the scheme did not take into account the high level of qualification which some staff in the pre-school sector had attained. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, in July of this year, sanction was received to add a higher capitation rate of €75 per week (€2,850 p.a.), for sessional services with highly qualified staff. To qualify for the higher capitation fee all Pre-School leaders must hold a level 7 or 8 qualification relating to childcare and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and all assistants must hold a relevant level 5 qualification.The annual capitation fee of €2,450 (or €2,850 in the case of the higher rate) will be paid to participating services for each child enrolled and availing of the free pre-school provision. This is considered sufficient to accommodate the great majority of services. The scheme also allows participating services to charge parents for additional services which they provide, including additional hours and activities, provided these are offered on a clearly optional basis to parents. Mandatory charges are not permitted under the scheme. The ECCE introduces, for the first time, minimum requirements in relation to staff qualifications. Together with the Workforce Development Plan, which is due to be launched next year, I am satisfied that the ECCE scheme will support the improvement of quality care and the level of qualifications held by staff working in pre-school services.

However, work on the preparation of a draft agreement with the Russian authorities is being undertaken. I am aware that there are people who have received Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt outside the State and may intend to adopt from Russia.  The decision regarding the country of choice for adoption is a matter for prospective applicants. This choice obviously should have regard to their personal preference, to their knowledge of and/or connection with the proposed country of origin and, also, to the status of the country as a contracting State either to the Hague Convention or to a bilateral agreement.The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention, was published on 23 January, 2009. The Bill, which recently passed all the stages in the Seanad, will continue to be prioritised by the Government for its passage through the Oireachtas. Any applicant who is seeking to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague country, or from a country with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement, should have regard to the likelihood of the adoption being completed in advance of the Adoption Bill being commenced.In relation to post-placement reports, an extensive examination of a list of required post-placement reports was carried out by the Health Service Executive and the Adoption Board. The Adoption Board has written to the Russian Embassy arising from this examination. I understand that the majority of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation — that is, the social workers have already conducted the home visit and the report.  In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their social worker. Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy in Dublin.

The Plan was endorsed by Government and was published on 28 July 2009. The Plan sets out 99 actions to address each of the 20 recommendations contained in the Ryan Report. It includes measures considered necessary to further improve services for children in care, in detention and at risk, to address the effects of past abuses, to reform service provision and to ensure that children and young people have a voice.Work has commenced across the various Government Departments and agencies to address the actions under their remit. The actions contained in the Plan are to be implemented over a four year timeframe, with each action assigned an individual target date for completion. As set out in the Plan, I will chair a high level group to oversee the implementation of the actions specified in the Plan.

The Departments of Finance and Health and Children have agreed in principle to the release of the proceeds of the disposal of properties prior to 2006 for reinvestment in mental health capital development.The arrangements for property disposal require Department of Finance approval in each case, the lodging of the proceeds as Exchequer Extra Receipts and the re-voting of the funds for approved projects. The HSE has disposed of a small number of psychiatric properties in recent years.  Proceeds of the sale of St. Loman's Hospital, Verville Retreat in Clontarf and two other Dublin properties, amount to just over €42m, and these funds have been surrendered to the Exchequer. A submission detailing the priority projects to be funded from these historic disposals has been received from the HSE. The submission has been examined in detail in the Department of Health & Children and some preliminary discussions have taken place with the Department of Finance in relation to the proposals. However, a number of issues have arisen which require clarification and further consideration.  The HSE has recently been requested to provide additional information and this information is awaited.

The CEO and one head of administrative staff were appointed in 2008. An additional two senior administrative staff took up duty with the Council in late August 2009 and will be responsible for Registration and Education and Legal Affairs and Fitness to Practice. These particular appointments will greatly assist the Council in their ongoing work in preparing for the establishment of the individual Professional Registration Board the first of which, The Social Work Registration Board, will be established later this year. It is hoped to bring additional Registration Boards on stream commencing in 2010, including The Physiotherapy Registration Board which has been delayed due to legal issues which are currently being resolved.The 2008 Budget Day announcement on rationalisation of agencies provided for the merging of the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) and the Opticians Board into with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council. There is a considerable amount of work involved for the Council in facilitating this rationalisation as efficiently and as effectively as possible. My Department is working with the Council, the PHECC and the Opticians Board to ensure that the appropriate administrative and legislative provision is in place to initiate this rationalisation, commencing 2010. The resources, both human and financial, which the Council will acquire on foot of rationalisation, will be of great assistance in rolling out of the twelve Registration Boards on a phased basis.

As of today, the Adoption Board has undertaken a review of 42 countries — 19 of which have ratified or acceded to the Hague Convention.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I take it that the Deputy is referring to the centralisation of the processing of medical card applications from Local Health Offices to the Executive's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Finglas. Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) 32 local health areas. However, under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the PCRS. The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over. The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.The HSE has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process. However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE to other critical frontline services and the Executive is working through the formal process with the trade union involved. This flexibility by public service workers is essential in the context of the current economic environment.I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (Under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided. Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November. It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.As the Deputy's question refers specifically to the position in Tallaght, Dublin 24, and the general Dublin south west area,  my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter, and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I propose to take Questions Nos. 473 and 470 together.There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, speech and language therapy services over the last number of years. A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.  In this regard, since 1997, the number of training places for speech and language therapy has been increased from 25 to 105 which represents an increase of 320%.Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services. In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services. The numbers employed in speech and language therapy has also grown significantly, from 282 whole time equivalents employed in December 1997 rising to 755 whole time equivalents employed in March 2009, which represents an increase of 168%. The Government is committed to ensuring continued adequate recruitment of professional staff across a range of service settings. Additional funding of €20 million has been provided in 2009 for health and education services for children with special educational needs. This includes funding of €10 million provided for health services for children with disabilities. This funding will provide a total of 125 additional therapy posts in the HSE (speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and social workers) targeted at children of school-going age. 90 of these will be in disability services and 35 posts will be allocated to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.My Department has written to the Health Service Executive setting out the overall approved employment control ceiling for 2009. As part of this approval, written confirmation has been provided to the HSE that the general moratorium on recruitment, promotion and the payment of acting up allowances does not apply to specific designated grades. Delegated sanction has been given to the HSE for the creation and filling of frontline posts including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy posts. The approval indicated that vacancies in existing posts in these grades may continue to be filled. New posts may also be created in these grades, up to a specified limit, provided that the HSE is satisfied in each case that there is no scope to redeploy an equivalent post from the hospital sector to the primary and community care sector. This moratorium exemption provides for an increase in the number of therapy posts, in line with Government policy, in order to meet the requirements of integrated care delivery and primary care needs particularly in respect of children at risk, the elderly and those with disabilities. The recruitment and retention of these key front line therapy posts, including speech and language therapists, is vital to ensure continued progress in the development of community settings.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. With regard to a national recruitment campaign for the appointment of speech and language therapists, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The issues referred to in these two reports are of concern to the Government especially since they confirm anecdotal reports that have been aired in the past.Firstly, the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, with technical assistance from UNICEF in Vietnam, published a Report known as the ‘MoLISA Report' entitled “Creating a protective environment for children in Vietnam:
An assessment of child protection laws and policies, especially children in special circumstances in Vietnam”.  The MoLISA report found that, inter alia:there are no detailed principles or criteria to guide the assessment in Vietnam of prospective guardians, foster parents or substitute  families for orphans;there is no framework for the systematic, professional assessment of orphans and abandoned children to determine what type of placement would be in their best interest, and to ensure that they are matched with the most appropriate alternative family;there is no clear requirement that decisions about alternative care be based on the child's best interest;there is no clear statement in law that international adoptions shall be used only as a last resort, once all options for placement within the country have been considered;there are no systematic procedures for ensuring that all efforts are made to find a suitable domestic family before consideration of international options;there is no requirement that birth parents be given counselling and be clearly informed of the consequences of adoption prior to giving consent;The Report contains a series of recommendations including, the need to:reform the institutional care of orphaned and abandoned children in Vietnam;provide counselling to birth parents prior to giving consent to adoption;intensify preparations for accession to the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption;centralise authority to consider and approve inter-country adoptions, andstipulate that international adoptions may be considered only after all other options have  been  explored and, also, that the child cannot be placed into foster care or with a  family or cannot, in any suitable manner, be cared for in Vietnam.In addition to the MoLISA Report, I have recently received, in draft form, the report of an examination of inter-country adoption in Vietnam carried out by the International Social Services (ISS) — a UN-affiliated organisation. The Report was jointly commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and seeks, inter alia, to "identify and address problems in both domestic and inter-country adoption  processes with a view to assisting Vietnam in its preparations to ratify  the Hague Convention”.I will be considering these two Reports jointly. These Reports go to the heart of the matter in relation to concerns in relation to inter-country adoption in Vietnam. I would be failing in my duty to protect children if I did not acknowledge and consider the content of these Reports extremely carefully before deciding on an appropriate response.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) 32 local health areas.  However, under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.The HSE has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE to other critical frontline services and the Executive is working through the formal process with the trade union involved.  This flexibility by public service workers is essential in the context of the current economic environment.I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (Under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications. Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided. Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.

This Consultant Dermatologist resigned her post earlier this year.The HSE sought on a number of occasions to recruit a suitable temporary replacement without success. Discussions have taken place between the HSE and a major teaching hospital in Dublin with a view to expanding the remit of the post. As a result of these discussions, the HSE intends to advertise the permanent restructured post within the coming weeks. In the meantime, the HSE is endeavouring to put arrangements in place pending filling of the post permanently.I understand that the appointment times issued to patients by the hospital were based on an expectation, at the time, that the consultant post was about to be filled.   Unfortunately, the expected appointment did not materialise. The hospital management regrets any confusion resulting from this.In the meantime, some patients who required urgent treatment have been seen in Dublin and arrangements have also been made for children to be treated in Dublin.I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on the waiting times and numbers of patients on the waiting list.

The Agency supports the delivery of crisis pregnancy and post termination counselling services through service level agreements with 14 providers operating in over 50 locations nationwide.The Crisis Pregnancy Agency is aware of the existence of a number of agencies which seek to manipulate women by providing a "disingenuous" crisis pregnancy counselling and/or information service.  The Agency is working on a wide range of actions to address this issue.  These actions include:A public awareness campaign which I launched in July 2009 entitled "Don't be manipulated" which highlights the existence of disingenuous agencies and promotes the availability of free, non-judgemental state-funded crisis pregnancy services.Continuous promotion through the "Positive Options" campaign of the availability of free, non-judgemental and confidential state-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services.Redevelopment of the "Positive Options" website to highlight the actions of disingenuous agencies and to give guidance on how to deal with same.Prominent advertising of "Positive Options" and consumer tips in the Golden Pages, including the regional directories, under "Pregnancy Testing and Counselling" and "Family Planning" sections.  The use of a common logo for all state funded counselling services in current editions of the Directories.Funding of resources which provide clear objective information on the adoption process.  The Agency provides information on adoption in manuals used in the training of bona fide crisis pregnancy counsellors.Expansion of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationally by over 50% since the Agency was established in 2001.Guidance for crisis pregnancy counselling services in responding to third party complaints they may receive about "disingenuous" counselling services.Standardised training and up-skilling for counsellors in state-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services.

I recently met with a delegation from the National Rehabilitation Hospital.The development of a new National Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be considered within the context of a national policy for the delivery of rehabilitation services.  My Department and the Heath Service Executive established a Working Group to develop a policy/strategy for the provision of rehabilitation services.  Its terms of reference include the development of an appropriate policy framework for rehabilitation and a preferred model of care for the provision of rehabilitation services.  The Working Group has met on a number of occasions to date and it is expected to complete its work in 2009.In the current economic situation, there is a need to ensure that all developments are planned and implemented to give best value for money and with the most appropriate mix of national, regional and local services.The proposal to develop a new National Rehabilitation Hospital at a capital cost in excess of €100m and an additional revenue requirement of €45m annually, must also be considered in the context of the current economic climate and available funding.

The aim is to migrate from traditional institutional based model to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate. Implementation of the recommendations in ‘A Vision for Change’ is primarily the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In April 2009  the HSE adopted an implementation plan for the five-year period 2009-2013.  In addition, a joint research initiative between the Mental Health Commission, the University of Limerick and the HSE is underway to examine the functioning and effectiveness of Community Mental Health Teams.  The HSE will shortly appoint a national lead for mental health which will bring a new impetus to the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change’.

It recommends, inter alia, that access to housing for individuals with mental health problems should be on the same basis as every other citizen, the provision of social housing is the responsibility of the Local Authority and opportunities for independent housing should be provided. Bilateral meetings with officials from the Office for Disability and Mental Health and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss progressing recommendations in ‘A Vision for Change’ have taken place. The Office is participating in the development of a national housing strategy for people with a disability, including mental illness, by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Cooperation between the HSE and Local Authorities is on-going. The voluntary housing sector also plays a significant role in the provision of social housing with regard to people with disabilities, in partnership with local authorities.   Capital funding is provided by the Department of the Environment,  through the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), to approved housing bodies to deliver housing for special needs groups, such as people with disabilities including those with a mental illness.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	626	The Booz Allen Hamilton study, jointly commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) for the island of Ireland, was published in April 2004.  The study did not support the establishment of a HEMS for emergency responses, as data on mortality and morbidity benefits to patients transported by HEMS in the primary response role and relative to ground ambulance services was inconclusive. The study offered a supportive view of helicopter use for inter-hospital transfers, with some evidence for the use of helicopters in the aeromedical response role, in support of the land service.In light of the report and the need to significantly enhance land ambulance services in both jurisdictions, the Departments agreed that policy for the medium-term would concentrate on the consolidation and development of land services. For the HSE, this includes:working to unify land ambulance services into one integrated national service;ensuring that ambulance personnel are trained to provide more complex pre-hospital care;improving the command and control function;organising emergency ambulance services to support the reconfiguration of the acute hospital service.An air ambulance service is currently provided by the Air Corps through a service level agreement with the Health Service Executive. The Air Corps service provides for the following categories:inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness;neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland;patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK;organ retrieval teams within Ireland;paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland.In addition, the Irish Coast Guard provides air ambulance inter-hospital transfers and also provides emergency medical evacuation from the islands around Ireland.  In situations where the Coast Guard service is not available, the Air Corps will transport patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals.In the circumstances, therefore, there are no plans at present to pursue the introduction of alternative air ambulance services.  In the event of the All-Ireland Air Ambulance Service commencing operations, the HSE would not be in a position to provide communications or manpower support or to integrate its activities into those of the public emergency ambulance services in any other way.

The scheme is being introduced on the 1st January 2010.Some 4,700 pre-school services are notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) and nearly 100 services are registered with the Irish Montessori Educational Board (IMEB).  As part of the preparations for introducing the new scheme, my Office wrote to all pre-school service providers in the State in June of this year inviting them to participate in the initiative.  To date, applications have been received from approximately 4,180 services.  I am informed that some 200 of the services written to have not applied to enter the scheme from January 2010 as they are already satisfactorily funded under other Government schemes such as the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).It is expected that a list of participating services will be made available to the City and County Childcare Committees by my Office by the middle of next month when the contract process is completed.  Arrangements for the implementation of the scheme are progressing well and it is on course to come into effect from January 2010.

This arrangement was subject to the following conditions: it applied only to relevant posts at or above Director function; and the posts in question would be abolished with a corresponding reduction in the HSE's employment ceiling. A total of 20 people have exited the system under this arrangement in the three year period from June 2006 to date (a number of others left prior to June 2006).In addition, following a recommendation by an independent mediator, special exit arrangements were sanctioned by the Department of Finance for former health board Chief Executive Officers who had been appointed to their posts on fixed term contracts to reflect the fact that their posts no longer existed under the new structure. Only one individual, who had a linkage to this group, has exited on this basis in the three year period from June 2006 to date (others left prior to June 2006).My Department is also aware of a chief executive officer who retired from a health service provider on grounds of redundancy and of one person who left another organisation as a result of rationalisation/restructuring in accordance with normal public sector arrangements.While individual benefits constitute personal data, I am making the following information available (based on the information available to me).PositionYearAdditional lump sum paymentAddition to Pension1200617,2695,7562200622,6297,5433200637,20612,4024200725,8883,6505200714,2774,7596200717,5005,8347200721,2367,0798200727,4769,1599200736,92612,30810200741,68613,89611200743,51814,50612200743,56214,52113200817,37064914200837,70712,56915200839,54112,76116200843,59514,53217200847,92515,9761820093,7721,25719200927,5129,17120200979,332*—21200942,19314,06522200944,67314,89123200951,51317,171*On the basis of their contract, this individual was also entitled to added years and six months severance.The calculation of pension benefits for retired officers of my Department is a matter for the Department of Finance in accordance with regulations governing these arrangements.

The Foundation is providing funding over a 3-year period which is being matched by the HSE. The HSE is committed to continuing the programme thereafter. The HSE is committed under action 34 of the National Drug Strategy 2009-2016 to providing needle exchange services where they are required.The Elton John AIDS Foundation is a leading world wide organisation dedicated to preventing the transmission of the HIV virus.  I understand that it supports projects in 55 countries (including the UK and the United States) across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.  Given that the Foundation funds projects on a wide geographic basis, I do not see anything inappropriate in the Irish health service having accepted its generous offer of support.

It is important to ensure that all of our pre-hospital emergency services, including the service provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade, function as a high quality, integrated health service.  The advice of the Health Information and Quality Authority on pre-hospital care issues will be a significant factor in determining how services should be organised so that they operate efficiently and that clinical governance, patient safety and quality standards are met.The HSE and Dublin City Council are in discussion regarding a number of practical issues, including the nature and terms on which Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin. The views of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to ambulance services in Dublin will be considered in this context.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	641	My Department and the HSE have implemented a number of reforms to reduce the cost of medicines to both the State and individual patients.  Under the terms of the current agreements between the HSE and pharmaceutical manufacturers, price cuts of 35% have been applied to all off-patent proprietary products for which generic alternatives are available on the Irish market. A report published by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics in May 2009 estimated that approximately €250 million will be saved due to off-patent price cuts, up to August 2010, when the agreements come up for renewal.Since 2006 a larger basket of reference countries has been used for determining the prices of new products accepted for reimbursement under the State drugs schemes. The current agreements also permit price adjustments to reflect price changes in the reference countries.I recently reduced the wholesale mark-up payable on medicines from 17.66% to 10% and reduced the retail mark-up payable under certain schemes from 50% to 20%. Savings from the measures have been estimated at €55 million for 2009 and €133 million on a full year basis.Historically, the reimbursement prices of non-drug items in Ireland were determined by the currency-adjusted UK prices. The prices of non-drug items have been frozen since 2003. The HSE has established a group to review the non-drug area and to consider procurement options for non-drug items which will deliver increased value for money.  My Department and the HSE are continuing to examine all options for containing pharmaceutical expenditure, including the introduction of a system of reference pricing.

The HSE continues to pursue all available options to ensure that best value for money is obtained for capital projects, including competitive tendering and the application of reductions in professional fees under Government policy. In line with recent general trends for capital investments, significant cost reductions are being achieved by the HSE, particularly in relation to the construction phase of all newly-contracted capital projects.   The question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply in relation to the details of the projects being progressed.The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs provides capital funding support for the development and refurbishment of childcare facilities under the National Childcare Investment Programme. Approximately one thousand such projects have or are being supported under this programme and a 25% reduction has been sought on the projected construction costs of projects that have not yet reached an advanced stage of development.  The replacement Cork centre for the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is currently in the design process.

As part of the Estimates process, my Department and the Health Service Executive are examining options which might provide expenditure savings next year, while to the greatest extent possible meeting the objective of maintaining population health and access to services.  This process is being informed by the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and other relevant considerations.All of these issues are being examined in the context of the Estimates process. Deliberations by Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.

However, it is important to note that anyone currently in receipt of subvention can choose to retain their current arrangements or can opt to transfer to the new scheme.Given that the subvention scheme will be replaced (for new applicants) by the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme, there are no plans to alter the terms or criteria of the subvention scheme for existing residents in any way.  The new Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a scheme of financial support for anyone in need of nursing home care.  The application form and information booklet for the scheme are now available to the public and may be obtained from the HSE.

The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended the abolition of the RTP.  The Government will consider the Group's recommendations as part of its preparations for Budget 2010.  The Government has also referred the Group's report to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and General Affairs for consideration prior to the Budget.Separate to and before receipt of the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, my Department had already decided that a Value for Money Review would be undertaken on the RTP in 2010.  Subject to the outcome of the deliberations and decisions referred to earlier, it is the intention to proceed with the review next year and all relevant matters relating to the operation of the Programme will be examined. This will include, as suggested by the Deputy, consideration of increased passenger revenue as, in appropriate circumstances, it is already the practice for passengers to make a personal contribution towards the cost of services.It is important that all the State resources devoted to rural transport generally are utilised as cost-effectively as possible and in that context a number of initiatives are currently under way to explore the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers (namely, the Health Service Executive for health transport, Department of Education and Science for school transport, Bus Éireann for conventional public transport and Pobal for RTP services).  These initiatives involve pilot transport projects in the North East and North West, an exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British-Irish Council.  The outcome of these initiatives will feed into the continuing development of rural transport.It is not possible to give a breakdown of the number of service users or funding provided under the RTP on a county by county basis as some of the community transport groups funded under the Programme operate across county boundaries.  However, the following table provides data on a global basis for the Programme for the years since it was launched in February 2007:YearFundingNumber of ServicesNumber of Passenger Journeys€20079,000,000120,753998,350200810,000,000140,0001,200,000200911,000,000(Estimated outcome) In excess of 140,000(Estimated outcome) In excess of 1,200,000

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	662	In September, 2004 the Government confirmed the Office of Public Works (OPW) as the State's lead agency in flooding, to be tasked with delivering an integrated, multifaceted programme aimed at mitigating future flood risk and impact.  As regards flooding of roads, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993, to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection of works to be funded from these grants is also a matter for the local authority.When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.Donegal County Council submitted a report to my Department in June this year in relation to damage to roads caused by flooding.  An official from the Department's Roads Inspectorate visited the site of the flooding to evaluate the extent of the damage. In the course of that visit he met with local authority engineers.  As an exceptional measure, and in view of the particular circumstances of the Donegal flooding, funding of €130,000 has been provided to Donegal County Council, for works approved by the Roads Inspectorate.  Consideration of any applications for financial assistance from local authorities has, of course, to take account of the current budgetary situation, the resources already allocated to the authority and the authority's ability to fund works from its own resources.

While the SRR considered possible developments in Donegal, in particular a proposed Derry-Letterkenny rail link which could, potentially be extended to Sligo, the SRR did not include this as a priority in its recommendations.  As a consequence, no capital provision for rail developments in County Donegal was included in Transport 21.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	665	The Irish Aviation Authority recently lodged a planning application in respect of the proposed new Visual Control Tower at Dublin Airport.  However, the building of the proposed Tower will only be required if the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) proceeds with the construction of a second runway at Dublin airport.  The current decline in the aviation market has affected traffic at the airport and the DAA has therefore deferred this element of its proposed capital programme for the airport, until such time as demand dictates.

The Government has previously decided to reopen phases 2 (Athenry-Tuam) and 3 (Tuam-Claremorris) of the corridor under Transport 21, my Department's investment framework for the years 2006-2015.The immediate next step, following completion of phase 1, will be for Iarnród Éireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of phases 2 and 3 with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake the works. I am committed to progress planning on the Western Rail Corridor. The current funding environment is very difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch. Nevertheless, I am seeking to progress planning of projects such as the Western Rail Corridor phases 2 and 3, to ensure that we are in a position to move speedily to construction when financial circumstances permit.In its report, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, under the chairmanship of Mr. Colm Mc Carthy, and established by the Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., recommended that there should be no further development of the Western Rail corridor.  The Government will be reflecting on the Report's recommendations over the months ahead. Decisions on implementation will rest with the Government and Dáil Éireann, including in the context of preparing the Budget for 2010 and later years. The Government has referred the Report for analysis and comment by the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and General Affairs prior to the Budget in December.

Where proposed services by the Company are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence held by a private bus operator issued under the Road Transport Act, 1932, Bus Eireann is required to obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before the Company can introduce such services.My Department received a proposal from Bus Eireann in June 2007 for changes to its Route 133 service from Wicklow to Dublin Airport to include a pick up and set down point in Bray. Following an initial examination, which included consultation with Bus Eireann, my Department concluded that  the proposal would give rise to competition with an existing licensed service.  Accordingly, my Department advised Bus Eireann on 10th November, 2007 that an application in accordance with Section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958 was required.  No application has since been received by my Department.

This report also contains the Corruptions Perceptions Index (CPI) which charts levels of corruption in countries worldwide.  The CPI has a rating scale of between 10 and 0, with a score close to 10 indicating an extremely low level of corruption, and a score close to 0 indicating a very high level of corruption.In the 2009 Report, Ireland is ranked jointly with the United Kingdom at 16th place with a CPI score of 7.7. This is in comparison to the 2008 report which ranked Ireland in 17th place with a CPI score of 7.5.  The 2009 assessment means that Transparency International has assessed that Ireland is the 16th least corrupt country out of the 180 countries analysed. While there is no room for complacency, Ireland's ranking in relation to global corruption has improved.  It is my intention to enact the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 at the earliest opportunity. Enactment of this Bill will allow for the ratification of the UN Convention Against Corruption and will help ensure that Ireland's rating will continue to improve.

As a result, statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to provide data on the reasons for refusal of applications for certificates of naturalisation. However, I can advise the Deputy that the main reasons for refusal of naturalisation applications are failure to meet residency and/or good character requirements and/or a failure to be self-supporting.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The Deputy will appreciate that a certificate of naturalisation is an exceptional and important document that facilitates a non-national becoming a citizen of Ireland. The granting of Irish Citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour and not an entitlement. Therefore, applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of Citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.
The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation. In accordance with the legislation I make decisions on naturalisation applications based on all of the information available to me. I have adopted a general policy that I will normally require an applicant for naturalisation, unless he/she is a refugee, programme refugee or Stateless person, to show that he/she has supported him or herself (and his or her family if appropriate) while residing in the State and, as far as can be determined, is in a position to continue that support into the future. I am, generally speaking, satisfied to accept that an applicant is self supporting if he or she has not availed of State support in the 3 year period prior to the date of application or subsequently has satisfied officials that they have supported themselves independently for that period.The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service's website  www.inis.gov.ie carries information relating to the main reasons why an application for a certificate of naturalisation might be refused. It also outlines how the financial status of an applicant is assessed in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State, and that enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.

His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 28 November 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  The case of the person concerned will be processed to finality as soon as possible.

The basic requirement for obtaining Irish citizenship by descent, through Foreign Births Registration is that an applicant's parent was an Irish citizen at the time of the applicants birth.A person born outside of Ireland with a parent who was born in Ireland is automatically an Irish citizen by descent. A person born outside of Ireland with parents who were born outside Ireland and a grandparent who was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by Foreign Births Registration.  If a person wishes to apply for Irish citizenship through a great grandparent born in Ireland, the position is more complex. Eligibility depends on one of the applicant parents, i.e. the grandchild of the person born in Ireland, being already entered in the Foreign Births Register, the date of that registration and the applicants date of birth.Under the 1956 Act, an applicant who was entered in the Foreign Births Register between 17 July 1956 and 30 June 1986 acquired Irish citizenship from the date that the Act came into force (17 July 1956) or the applicants date of birth, whichever was later.  Under the 1986 Act, a person is accorded Irish citizenship from the actual date of entry in the Foreign Births Register.

Accordingly, he is required to renew his GNIB Card on a monthly basis for operational reasons.  It is not intended to review this arrangement until the GNIB enquiries are completed and considered.However, if this arrangement is causing difficulties, the person concerned should write to the Ministerial Decisions Unit of my Department at 13/14, Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 giving details of the difficulties being experienced and the matter will be given further consideration.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed, by letter dated 18 August 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), to be exercised within 15 working days.  Namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.By correspondence dated 28 February 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by his legal representative.  Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused.  The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 23 July 2009.His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State.  On 20 August 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to leave the State by 25 September 2009 or failing that, present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 1 October 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.  He failed to present and was classified as evading his deportation.  Should he come to the notice of the Gardaí, he would be liable to arrest and detention.  He should, therefore, present himself to the GNIB without any further delay.I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified. The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

Representations were submitted by the person concerned at that time.On 26 July, 2005, the Minister signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this Order was served by registered post. This communication advised the person concerned of the legal requirement that she ‘present' herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 18 August, 2005 in order to make arrangements for her deportation from the State. The person concerned ‘presented' on this occasion but failed to ‘present' on a subsequent occasion and was therefore classified as a person evading deportation.This position continued to obtain until May 2008 when the legal representative of the person concerned enquired into the possible entitlement of the person concerned to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  Arising from this enquiry, and in accordance with the Minister's discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, the person concerned was allowed to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State which she duly did.  This application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.The person concerned remains the subject of a valid Deportation Order. However, the Deputy may be assured that this Order will not be enforced pending the determination of the Subsidiary Protection application.

The person concerned applied for asylum on 13 August 2002.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 29 August 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

This letter was sent to the last recorded address of the person concerned.  The person concerned has not, to date, responded to my Department's letter.  It is noted, however, that the address supplied in the Deputy's Question does not match the address currently on record in my Department.  If, as it appears, the person concerned has changed address, he is legally obliged to communicate such an address change to my Department without delay.  In any event, the position in the State of the person concerned will be considered further upon receipt of a response to my Department's letter dated 5 May 2009.

The person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the then Asylum Division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, on appeal, by the then Asylum Appeals Unit of the Department.  The person concerned was notified of this latter decision by letter dated 28 July 1999.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, the person concerned was given the options of making a written application to the Minister in support of his case to be allowed to remain in the State or of making arrangements to leave the State within fourteen days of the date of that letter.  An application to be allowed to remain in the State was submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.Also arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was further notified, by letter dated 21 March 2001, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  No further representations were received from, or on behalf of, the person concerned at that time.On 10 October 2006, Regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) came into force.  The person concerned was notified, by letter dated 1 June 2007, that he could, if he so wished, submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  He was also invited to update his earlier representations to the Minister. He was requested to respond within 15 working days.  Updated representations were received on behalf of the person concerned as was an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  Following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 10 June 2008.The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. In the absence of more specific information, the Visa Office is not in a position to address the matter of Family Reunification as raised by the Deputy.It is however, open to all persons resident outside the State, and who are visa required to apply through their nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate for the appropriate visa.  Each visa application is considered on its individual merits the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why a visa should be granted.  Comprehensive information when making a visa application is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).

The person concerned continues to meet the presentation requirements of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (G.N.I.B.) in accordance with Section 8(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). He is due to present again on 15 October 2009.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.

He subsequently withdrew his asylum claim on the basis that he was the parent of an Irish born child.  He was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of his parentage of an Irish born child in September 1997.  This permission to remain has subsequently been renewed and was most recently valid up until 18 August 2009. It is not clear from my Department's file as to what difficulties the person concerned is experiencing regarding his position in the State.  This being the case, it is recommended that the person concerned would write to my Department's Repatriation Division outlining any outstanding issues he may have and upon receipt of such a communication, officials in my Department will investigate any issues raised.

The person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 December 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), to be exercised within 15 working days, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State.  On 23 September 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person to leave the State by 17 October 2009.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I.

Following consideration by a Visa Officer, it was refused for the following reasons:1. The evidence of finances provided was deemed insufficient;2. There was no evidence shown of a relationship having been in existence prior to the visa application/marriage.The applicant submitted an appeal on the 10 June 2009.  While the evidence of finances was addressed to the satisfaction of the Appeals Officer, evidence to support the existence of a prior relationship was not.  As a result, the decision of the Visa Officer was upheld by the Visa Appeals Officer on 29 June 2009.  Only one appeal per application is allowed.  The only option available to the applicant is to make a fresh visa application.  Where doing so the applicant should be in a position to address the refusal reason upheld at appeal stage.

Subsequently the Council voted that the house known as "Thornton Hall" should be added to the record of protected structures in its administrative area.  In the intervening period essential repair work has been undertaken, when necessary, in order to maintain and to protect the property.  The cost of this work amounts to approximately €27,000.  The work was undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 in relation to protected structures and was carried out under the supervision of a conservation architect.The Deputy will also be aware that the Irish Prison Service undertook a major boundary planting scheme at Thornton which involved planting over 25,000 trees and shrubs along the boundary of the 150 acre site to a depth of 10 metres.  The cost of boundary planting scheme and the maintenance of the planted zone including weed control is approximately €440,000.  Approximately €30,000 of this sum relates to maintenance of the planted zone.It should also be noted in this context that when granting development consent for the prison project at Thornton, the Oireachtas decided that the planted zone should be widened at certain areas across the site as part of a number of measures to mitigate the visual and aural impact of the development.  I expect that the additional planting work will get underway later this year.  The property is not leased and, therefore, no income is generated from it.

County Longford never formed a Garda Division in its own right and accordingly the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.

Furthermore, in respect of any queries regarding the provision of legal services to any person, please note that the solicitor/client relationship is protected by privilege in accordance with the terms of Section 32 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  The Legal Aid Board does not provide information to third parties regarding a person who may or may not be a client of the Board.It should be noted that the Legal Aid Board is required to consider and make decisions on all applications received in its Law Centres for legal aid.  I have had enquiries made in the Legal Aid Board and I have been informed that when deciding to grant legal aid, the Board issues a Legal Aid Certificate to the applicant setting out the services to be rendered on that particular matter.  In the event that the Board decides not to grant a Legal Aid Certificate, the applicant would be directly informed of the decision and the reasons supporting the decision.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that the opening of a new Garda Station would be incompatible with contemporary policing policy and would result in valuable Garda resources being diverted from outdoor, operational policing to indoor administration duties.  In that context, I am informed that there are no plans to open a Garda Station at Palmerstown, Dublin 20.

The 2008 Act amended the Solicitors Acts to strengthen the Law Society's regulatory functions by providing, among other matters, for a lay majority on the regulatory committees of the society and for better enforcement of orders of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.The 2009 Act provides for the establishment of a Legal Services Ombudsman.  When it is established, the Ombudsman will provide a form of review for clients of solicitors and barristers who are dissatisfied with the outcome of a complaint made to the Law Society or Bar Council; oversee the complaints procedures of the Law Society and Bar Council by examining a selection of complaints files each year; and oversee admission to the legal profession, particularly with regard to the adequacy of numbers admitted.  A Legal Costs Bill is included in the Government’s legislation programme, which was published on 16 September 2009.  Work is under way in my Department on the development of the details of the proposals.

The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advises me that while the person in question was refused refugee status following appeal, permission to remain in the State was granted in 2007.  An alternative travel document may sometimes be issued in exceptional circumstances to a person who has been granted leave to remain in the State and does not have a passport.  In such cases, the person concerned has to show that they have made reasonable and formal efforts to obtain a national passport and that it has been formally and unreasonably refused.  Provision of original correspondence from the relevant consular authorities is an essential component when considering any temporary travel document application.  A temporary travel document was issued to the person in question in May 2008 to help them obtain their national passport.  In January 2009, a further request for a travel document was received, again with a view to procuring their national passport.  The original travel document was renewed for a further nine months from 20 January 2009 to 19 October 2009.  It remains open to the person in question to submit an application for a renewal of their temporary travel document accompanied with the relevant supporting documentation which should include original correspondence from the relevant consular authority outlining the steps necessary to be followed by the person to facilitate the procurement of a national passport if their presence is required outside the State.  Any such application should be forwarded to the Travel Document Unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.

A prosecution was directed in the other incident, and the driver was convicted of having no insurance, contrary to the Road Traffic Acts, as amended.  Two incidents have occurred to date in 2009.  Following the submission of an investigation file to the Law Officers in one of the incidents, a direction was issued to charge the driver with careless driving.  The matter is before the courts.

As a result, a wide range of measures in relation to firearms licensing have been introduced such as the requirement that applicants will provide secure accommodation for their firearms, prove their identity, provide the names of two referees and give consent to medical enquiries being made where necessary.  With the introduction of the new three-year licence comes a new, more detailed, application form which is available on the Garda website and from Garda stations.  I understand that the form itself is nine pages long, although the last three of these pages are for Garda use, making it six pages to be completed by the applicant.  The Garda Commissioner has published "Guidelines as to the Practical Application and Operation of the Firearms Acts, 1925-2009" on the Garda website.  That document, along with advice on how to complete the form, should prove invaluable in assisting members of the public in understanding the new licensing arrangements.

The Government has consistently called for its closure since then and has welcomed President Obama's decision to close Guantanamo.  In response to US requests for assistance in resettling some of these detainees, EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers adopted a framework at the June Ministerial Council in relation to resettlement of former detainees.  The resettlement in Ireland of the two individuals referred to in the Deputy's question is a humanitarian measure and a practical step towards the ultimate closure of Guantanamo Bay. The primary reason for agreeing to resettle them here is because, although they were cleared for release by the US authorities and were not to be prosecuted by the US, it was considered that, they could not, for compelling reasons, be returned to their home countries.  I hope they will now be given the time and space to rebuild their lives here in Ireland.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	803	The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons and makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  These provisions extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.An Garda Síochána has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to these requirements.  Its Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions, and maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.  There is a nominated Garda inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring in their Division of persons subject to the requirements of the Act.In November, 2006 the Government and the British Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the sharing between An Garda Síochána and British police forces, including the Police Service of Northern Ireland, of information on sex offenders.  The MoU relates to information about persons travelling between this jurisdiction and the UK (including Northern Ireland) and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.  Its purpose is the sharing of such information for the purposes of the protection of the public from the risks presented by sex offenders and the investigation of serious sexual offences and covers any information necessary to achieve these purposes.  Such information sharing had been taking place informally at police level for some time.In September, 2008 An Garda Síochána and the PSNI signed an agreement on the sharing of personal data in relation to the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders.  Under the Agreement, the information to be shared relates to persons who are subject to the notification requirements of the Sex Offenders Act and the equivalent UK legislation.Information exchanged under the agreement is used for the prevention and detection of crime of a sexual nature and the prosecution of offenders.  It has improved communication channels between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI and enhanced child protection on the island of Ireland.  The agreement formalises the exchange of information which has always taken place and sets out procedures under which this will now take place.  The information is exchanged in accordance with data protection legislation in force in both parts of Ireland.An Garda Síochána is notified by the PSNI when it becomes aware that a convicted sex offender is travelling or has travelled from Northern Ireland to this jurisdiction.  Likewise, An Garda Síochána notifies the PSNI when it becomes aware that a convicted sex offender is travelling or has travelled from this jurisdiction to Northern Ireland.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is at an advanced stage and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	805	I propose to take Questions Nos. 752 and 753 together.As I have already indicated in response to a number of Parliamentary Questions answered on 16 and 23 September, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) was ratified by Ireland on 8 December 1989.The Optional Protocol to this International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) will, when it comes into force, set up a mechanism that will make it possible for individuals or groups of individuals to submit a complaint to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in regard to violations of their economic, social and cultural rights by a State Party to that Protocol. It does not create any new substantive rights.Discussions on the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR took place in a Working Group which held its first session in 2004. In June 2006, the UN Human Rights Council mandated the Working Group to negotiate the text of an Optional Protocol, and requested the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group to prepare a draft to serve as the basis for negotiations.Following consideration by the UN Human Rights Council, the text of the Optional Protocol was presented last year to the UN General Assembly, which adopted the text by consensus on 10 December 2008, the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Officials of this Department were actively engaged at all stages of negotiation on the Optional Protocol, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments, our EU partners and other UN member States.Inter-Departmental consultations on the possibility of Ireland's signature and ratification of the Optional Protocol are continuing, with this Department playing a co-ordination role. As this process has not yet been completed, Ireland was not in a position to sign the Optional Protocol when it opened for signature in New York on 24 September.Seven States parties signed the Optional Protocol at the opening ceremony. Since then, a further 22 States have signed. I arranged for Ireland to be represented at the opening ceremony, even though we were not in a position to sign. No State has yet ratified the Optional Protocol. The Optional Protocol can only come into force three months after the deposit with the UN Secretary-General of the tenth instrument of ratification or accession.I can assure the Deputy that I will make every effort to ensure that the consideration of Ireland's signature and ratification by relevant Government Departments is completed as quickly as possible.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	806	The working holiday agreement which was concluded between the Irish and US governments in September last year became operational in January of this year. This agreement allows those enrolled in or recently graduated from, post secondary education to apply for a visa to work and live in the United States for a period of one year.This reciprocal programme is also open to US citizens wishing to spend a year in Ireland. The agreement represents the successful completion of one strand of the government's three pronged strategy to address migration flows between Ireland and the USA. We continue to work with the US Administration to agree a reciprocal long term working visa and to find a solution for the undocumented Irish in America.For Irish citizens the working holiday agreement is administered in two stages. In the first instance an application must be made to an authorised sponsoring organisation who take the decision to issue a DC-2019 form which applicants must then present to the American Embassy in Dublin who take the final decision to issue the visa. The largest sponsoring organisations are currently USIT Travel and the Boston Irish Immigration Centre (BIIC). These organisations have received 231 applications. While precise details of approvals are not available, I understand that the vast majority have been approved.For American citizens, applications must be lodged through the embassy in Washington or one of our Consulates General throughout the USA. To date 102 visas have been issued, 15 applications have been approved but not yet issued and a further 5 are currently pending approval, subject to further documentation. There have been 10 refusals issued to American citizens who were not eligible for the programme.The working holiday agreement has proved positive to date and the government will continue to work with the US authorities and other organisations to ensure its continuation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	807	Ireland's position on settlements is very clear, and has been consistently stated on many occasions in the Oireachtas, most recently in reply to Question 784 of the 16th September. Israeli settlement building, whether in East Jerusalem or in the West Bank, is illegal under international law and represents a primary obstacle to the two-State solution. Continued expansion of these settlements undermines the viability of a Palestinian State and makes the realisation of that goal harder to achieve.The daily and cumulative injustices and humiliations which the whole settlement process entails for the Palestinian population serve to increase the risk of another large scale descent into violence. Within the EU, Ireland has worked hard to keep a sharp focus on this issue, and to ensure that the EU's concerns about settlement expansion are made known to the Israeli Government at every opportunity. I have also personally raised my deep concerns about the issue directly with Israeli leaders and officials, both here and in Israel.Trade relations with Israel are governed by the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which provides for preferential rates of duty on imports, in the same way as with many other countries. It is clear, however, that goods originating in settlements outside Israel proper are not entitled to avail of these preferential rates or exemptions, and full customs duties should be paid on them. This has been a subject of discussion between the EU Commission and Israel, and various measures have been established to make it possible to distinguish between Israeli and settlement goods. There are obvious difficulties in ensuring that this is 100% effective, and there is ongoing consideration of how this might be improved.Control of imports into Ireland, including the identification of point of origin, are matters in the first instance for the Irish Customs Service.

The electronic accounting system currently in operation at my Department has only been in place since 2004 and it therefore has only been possible in the time available to obtain comprehensive figures since this date. As the Deputy will appreciate, the role of Minister for Foreign Affairs includes an obligation to undertake a significant amount of official travel overseas.My Department is fully compliant with the Department of Finance guidelines on foreign travel. My Department also operates its own detailed internal travel guidelines and practises which ensure cost effective travel practises, both in Headquarters and throughout our network of 75 diplomatic missions abroad. The central aim of the Departmental travel policy, which embraces both Ministers and officials, is to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.2004*20052006200720082009 (January– August)€€€€€€Minister Cowen34,250Minister Ahern4,76736,46120,1328,09218,738Minister Martin4,8752,896Total:39,01736,46120,1328,09223,6142,896

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	809	The Government is very concerned about the recent reports of violent incidents in Camp Ashraf, the situation of those detained and also the more general predicament of its residents.Camp Ashraf is home to over three thousand members of the People's Mujahideen of Iran (PMOI), an Iranian opposition group that established itself in Iraq in 1986 at the invitation of Saddam Hussein. However, following the war in 2003 and the collapse of the previous regime, Iraq's new Government have made clear their unhappiness at the continued presence in Iraq of the PMOI. This is due both to the importance of improving relations with Iran, and to the past actions of the PMOI in support of Saddam Hussein's regime, including its involvement in attacks on Iraqi civilians.Camp Ashraf and its inhabitants were afforded protection by the US military when the US occupied Iraq in 2003. Earlier this year the Iraqi Government resumed full control of responsibility for security in Iraq from the US military. It is therefore incumbent upon the Iraqi authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of those still living in the Camp and to prevent the recurrence of violence such as that which took place recently (after residents had clashed with Iraqi police following an attempt to establish a police station in the Camp).The determination of the Iraqi authorities to establish sovereign control throughout their territory and to resist the establishment of any "no-go" areas is understandable. The critical point, however, is that there must be no question of a forcible return to Iran of the residents of the Camp. The Iraqi authorities have so far stated that they have no intention of doing this.This year the Government, through Irish Aid, provided €200,000 in support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for its programming in Iraq. This includes emergency assistance to those affected by the conflict as well as the promotion of international humanitarian law and protection activities, such as visits to detainees. The ICRC regularly visits Camp Ashraf in fulfilment of its protection mandate, and has regularly reminded the authorities of their obligation to ensure that those living in the Camp have access to such basic necessities as food, water and medical care.I can assure you that the Government will continue to follow developments closely, both regarding the future of the Camp and the wider security situation in Iraq itself.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The report of the review of Ireland's aid programme by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD was published in May. It provided a strong, independent endorsement of the programme and of the Government's development policies. The OECD praised Ireland's focus on the fight against global poverty and hunger, and the strong focus of the aid programme on the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It described Ireland as a champion in making aid more effective.The OECD also noted the Government's commitment to an integrated policy approach to development across Departments, in line with the broad political consensus in Ireland that the fight against poverty is not merely a matter of providing overseas development assistance. It welcomed the establishment of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Development and recommended that it address inconsistencies and potential policy conflicts among key Government Departments.The Government established the Inter-Departmental Committee on Development in April 2007, with the objective of strengthening coherence in our approach to development and making best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service. As the current Chair of the Committee, I am pleased that it has become the key forum for the sharing of knowledge and views on development issues across Departments, and that it has intensified the work of ensuring that a strong development perspective is integrated into Government decision-making in all relevant areas.At the ninth meeting of the Committee, in July, we reviewed the findings and recommendations of the OECD peer review. I also welcomed the publication of a scoping report commissioned by Irish Aid which makes a series of recommendations, across Departments, on possible areas in which the coherence of development policy might be improved. This report, and the statements being prepared by a number of Departments on their contribution to the improvement of policy coherence on development issues, will be further considered at the next meeting of the Inter-Departmental Committee later this month. As Chair of the Committee, I am committed to ensuring that Government Departments work together more closely so that the full range of our policies in areas including trade, the environment and agriculture support the long term objective of eradicating poverty and hunger among the world's poorest people.

The Government is determined to build on the positive momentum generated at the Forum and to take forward the wide range of ideas suggested during the discussions.I will shortly bring a comprehensive report of the Forum discussions and suggested outcomes to Government. This will include details of how the Government can continue to develop a more strategic relationship with the global Irish, including those living in Argentina.The Government values its long-standing bilateral relationship with Argentina. It remains an important trading partner for Ireland and several major Irish companies have significant operations there. Earlier this year, I met with representatives of the State Agencies and the private sector to assess how the Government can provide increased support to advance the State's economic interests in Latin America, including in Argentina.Since 2006, the Government has, through the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP), been able to provide almost €140,000 in financial support to Irish-Argentine community associations to strengthen the links between these communities and Ireland. Further grant applications from Argentina are being considered as part of the current round of ESP funding and will be decided on over the coming weeks.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	818	In 2008, Ireland spent €920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA). This represented approximately 0.59 % of our Gross National Product (GNP).For 2009 the total budget for ODA is expected to reach €696 million. Based on current projections this will represent at least 0.48% of GNP. This means that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.The Government has established a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012. Achieving this target will be a challenge in the current economic circumstances. The Government will make a full assessment of our capacity to achieve it in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget.The estimates process for 2010 is now underway leading to the Budget in December. As the Deputy is aware there are many competing demands for scarce resources. Our aim is to protect the aid programme to the maximum extent achievable within the context of the current difficult fiscal environment.As the Deputy will appreciate I cannot give an undertaking in relation to the exact figure for development assistance for 2010 in advance of the Budget. This is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance. However, I can state that both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will make the best possible case in support of the aid budget.

Such works are instead factored into, and funded from, the budgets of the capital project in question by the relevant organisation undertaking the project and each department and agency may retain details of such expenditure.  No funding is received by Department of Arts Sport and Tourism from the Per Cent for Arts Scheme.In respect of my own Department, a total of €64,000 was spent on the scheme in 2008.  All of this amount was expended on the commissioning of art in relation to the Department's new headquarters in Killarney.  There was no expenditure by the Department under the scheme in the other years.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	822	The Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary vehicle for Government support for the provision of sports facilities and equipment in this country.Since 1998, through the Sports Capital Programme, the Government has invested over €725 million in over 7,400 separate sporting projects.  This investment has transformed the Irish sporting landscape with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from basic sports facilities and new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional integrated multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.This investment is evidence of the importance that this Government places on sport.  Sports facilities that are well-planned, built and managed have the ability to act as focal points for a community and allow more people to get involved in healthy activities.  Participation in sport is important for many reasons.  For individuals, participation has health benefits, builds confidence and gives people a sense of their worth.  For society as a whole, sport can reduce anti-social behaviour while sporting success has the ability to lift the spirits of whole counties and even the whole country.€56 million has been provided in my Department's Vote in 2009 out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  I expect that all of this funding will be drawn down by grantees by the end of year.  It can be expected that many of the grantees drawing down this funding are benefiting from the reduction in construction costs this year.No decision has been taken on the next round of the Programme.

It is anticipated that outstanding commitments on hand at the end of 2009 will be below €120m.When provisional allocations are made under the Sports Capital Programme grantees must comply with all the terms and conditions of the Programme and have completed a substantial amount of progress on their project to facilitate the draw down of the grant within 15-18 months.  However, the Department adopts a flexible approach and tries to give clubs every opportunity to draw down grants.  Where delays are excessive, or the project has ceased, the Department seeks to withdraw allocations.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	825	Operational responsibility for tourism marketing rests with the tourism agencies. In terms of the future funding for such campaigns, this will be considered as part of the normal discussions on the forthcoming Budget and the Departmental Estimates for 2010.There is no doubt that the period to date in 2009 has been very difficult for tourism globally with all major international tourism destinations showing decreased numbers of visitors. Latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show a reduction of 10.4% in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland for the first seven months of 2009 compared with the corresponding period of 2008.  While any reduction in the number of overseas visitors is disappointing, it must be seen in context.  Ireland enjoyed several years of successive growth in visitor numbers, reaching a record of just over 8 million in 2007.  In terms of the 2009 figures, Ireland is actually maintaining its position, or performing better than some other competitor destinations.In terms of marketing campaigns, Tourism Ireland is keeping its programmes under constant review, to ensure necessary flexibility and responsiveness.  It front-loaded its campaigns across all markets to secure as much business as possible for the peak and shoulder season and has now intensified its tactical and cooperative marketing activity for the second half of the year with an €18 million autumn campaign. An intensive marketing campaign is currently underway in the North American market. The campaign focuses mainly on the 8 gateways which offer direct services to the island, including those to Shannon. The  “Ireland’s Wonderful West Awaits You” campaign is continuing and throughout September and October, Tourism Ireland is carrying out a five-week “Ireland’s Wonderful West Awaits You” online advertising campaign.On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland committed to its largest ever campaign to promote home holidays in 2009, with in excess of €3 million being invested in a year-round marketing programme promoting awareness of, and interest in, taking a home break.  The Autumn Initiative, co-ordinated and implemented by Fáilte Ireland with additional funding from members of the tourism industry, was launched last month and is intended to boost business in September and October 2009.While I know that our businesses and tourism agencies are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  Accordingly, I established the Tourism Renewal Group, which has been tasked with reviewing and, where appropriate, renewing the current tourism strategy to ensure that it is focused for the short term and, looking further ahead, that the tourist industry is well placed to benefit from the upturn when it comes.  The Group has finalised its report, which contains recommendations in the form of a Framework for Action for the period to 2013 and it will be published very shortly.

Both have a community development element and both are delivered through separate local delivery structures.I have already indicated that my strong view is that a single focused programme with a single integrated delivery structure is now needed in order to maximise the impact of these two programmes which serve disadvantaged communities.  The Centre for Effective Services is currently preparing proposals for me in this regard, which will draw on good international practice and independent advice. I hope to receive this in the near future with a view to rolling out a new programme early next year.In advance of proceeding to establish a single programme across CDPs and Partnerships, my Department has initiated an evaluation of individual Community Development Projects. Many of these projects span across two decades with quite diverse activities. Again, I hope to have proposals from my Department in the near future.While I cannot be specific at this stage about the impact on specific bodies in the Cavan Monaghan area, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures.

Regulations made under these Acts control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the schedules to the Acts. Substances are scheduled under the Acts in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.As the Deputy points out "snow" is not currently scheduled under Misuse of Drugs legislation and I understand that it is being sold in so-called headshops and through the internet.As part of its work, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs looks at information exchange and risk assessment in regard to new synthetic drugs within EU Member States.  The NACD is aware of the substance in question and I understand that it will be considered at the next meeting of its Early Warning and Emerging Trends Sub-committee.Meanwhile, through an action under the new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, led by the Department of Health & Children, it is proposed to monitor the activities of headshops, and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances, with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken.

This allocation will fund existing and some new initiatives under the Premises Initiative Fund and it will also complete the outstanding commitments under the once-off 2008 Regional Youth Initiative Fund.Overall, I am satisfied that the funding being provided in 2009 by my Department will continue to facilitate the delivery of valuable community-based initiatives to help address problem drug use.The Deputy will be aware that the Drugs Strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies and my Department's allocation is part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.

Section 12 of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 provides that financial institutions transfer the moneys in account determined as dormant before the 30th April each year.  In general, all transfers to the Dormant Accounts Fund occur in the months of March and April each year.  Reclaims by account holders may be made at any time during the year.Since its establishment in May 2003, the net transfers to the Dormant Accounts Fund have been just over €334.1m.

As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding, the progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas and associated costs involved in support and delivery of the Programme.My Department, supported by Pobal, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID Programme and funds the cost of this support.I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.The following table shows the expenditure under these headings since 2004.Year200420052006200720082009*€m€m€m€m€m€mCo-ordination1.30.9931.3331.5571.4941.4Leverage1.9784.5164.5455.3168.0837.09Total3.2785.5095.8786.8739.5778.49*Estimated 2009 outturn.My Department continues to fund the co-ordination of the Programme and to process claims lodged under the different Leverage Schemes under the 2009 voted allocation.In effect although funding for some programmes operated by my Department has been reduced, I still expect that a sufficient spend will be made in order to ensure continued positive impact across RAPID areas.

Under the Programme, expenditure of  €15.86m has been provided for in 2009 and as a result, a high number of projects will continue to be implemented throughout the country.CLÁR is demand driven and is operated as a single national Programme for areas that have suffered significant depopulation, rather than by way of allocations on a county or regional basis.  Accordingly, expenditure will always vary year-on-year under the Programme between counties and regions, depending on the projects identified by those Government Departments/Agencies and Local Authorities with which the CLÁR Programme co-funds.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	857	I propose to take Questions Nos. 831 and 852 together.The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers to people needing ongoing care and support. In recognition of this, considerable improvements have been made in recent years in services and supports for carers.Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.In Budget 2009, the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over increased by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week. These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer's allowance will be €650 million in 2009.During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process to develop a National Carers' Strategy. However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy. This position remains unchanged.All work on the development of the strategy including research, the management of the public consultation process and the preparation of draft material was carried out by officials in my Department in conjunction with the members of the interdepartmental working group. The public consultation process undertaken between February and April 2008 was advertised in all regional and national newspapers at a cost of €128,000. The work carried out by the interdepartmental group and the submissions made to it have been useful and will of course contribute to the development of carers policy in the future.

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.The Dublin/Mid Leinster area of the HSE has advised that it made an exceptional needs payment to the persons concerned on 26 August 2009.  There is no record of a more recent claim for an exceptional needs payment. If the people concerned wish to claim such a payment, they should contact their local community welfare officer.

This care and attention must be provided by another person, effectively full time, so as to allow the child deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received from the person in question on 21st July 2009.  This application was referred to one of the Department's Medical Assessors who found that the child did not satisfy the medical criteria pertaining to the scheme.A letter issued to the person in question on 21st September 2009 advising of the decision to refuse Domiciliary Care Allowance on the basis that the medical criteria had not been satisfied. In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or request that the case be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor.Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer, they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

There have been a number of developments in this scheme since its inception, including upward and downward adjustments in the level of the bonus payment.Each year the Government makes a decision on the payment of the Christmas Bonus having regard to the prevailing economic circumstances. This year it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure so as to restore order and stability to the public finances.In this context, the decision was made that the Christmas Bonus would not be paid in 2009. The decision was announced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I propose to take Questions Nos. 837 and 843 together.Current estimates indicate that the abolition of the PRSI ceiling would yield some €119.5 million additional contribution income in a full year.Under the PRSI system, social insurance contributions are compulsorily payable by employers and employed and self-employed workers. In relation to employee's contributions, the amount payable is determined by reference to reckonable earnings in a weekly period, and is subject to a range of thresholds and an annual ceiling. The PRSI exemption on low earnings stands at €352 per week. People with incomes at that level or below are exempt from PRSI. Once a person earns above this level their total income, up to the annual ceiling, is chargeable to PRSI but they are entitled to a PRSI-Free Allowance of €127 per week.The employee PRSI ceiling is reviewed annually in accordance with the legislative stipulations of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 and is currently €75,036. Any future changes to the PRSI ceiling would have to be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I propose to take Questions Nos. 838 and 839 together.Pay related social insurance is not a tax. Therefore additional revenue raised from any change to the PRSI system goes directly to the social insurance fund rather than the Exchequer.The payment of PRSI primarily relates to income derived from reckonable earnings from employment or self-employment. The Commission on Taxation has recommended a further widening of the PRSI base so that both unearned income such as investment income and rental income and share-based remuneration should be subject to PRSI.In regard to unearned income at present, self-employed contributors pay PRSI on rental income. In addition while employed contributors are not generally subject to PRSI on investment income and rental income there is a liability where the individual concerned also has trade, professional or partnership income in which case they are chargeable to PRSI as a self employed contributor on rental income. Therefore, a significant amount of rental income is already subject to PRSI.Share based remuneration is currently not included in the PRSI base as it is not considered as reckonable earnings, reckonable emoluments or reckonable income under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.It is not possible therefore, to estimate of the potential yield for rental income and share based remuneration which is currently not subject to PRSI.

The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.The Regulations are also intended to guarantee equality of treatment, under various national legislation, to workers living in the Member States and their dependants and survivors.  Accordingly, persons residing in a Member State to whom the Regulation applies are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits as the nationals of that State.  Therefore, Irish nationals may indeed be entitled to social welfare payments in other EU jurisdictions, providing they satisfy the qualifying criteria adopted by that Member State, in exactly the same way as nationals of that State are required to do.  In meeting these qualifying conditions, under EU Regulations, a person can generally aggregate their Irish contributions with those made in other EEA states.The basis on which payments are made, the qualifying conditions which must be satisfied and the rates of social welfare payments vary greatly from State to State and reflect the income replacement requirements and the manner in which the different States address social needs in their jurisdiction As you will appreciate, due to the large number of countries affected by these Regulations, i.e. the twenty seven Member States, three EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), and Switzerland, it is not possible to include a comprehensive comparison of the schemes of each State here.  However, such a comparative list exists on the MISSOC (Mutual Information System on Social Protection)websitehttp://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/missoc_tables_en.htm

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	876	The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.The 2009 Supplementary Budget introduced new arrangements for applications for rent supplement.  In order to qualify for rent supplement, from the 27th July 2009, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside).  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.The aim of this restriction on entitlement to rent supplement and the new working arrangements is to ensure that housing authorities remain the principal agents both for assessing housing need and for meeting the long-term housing needs of people.Detailed guidelines on the operation of the restrictions on access to rent supplement were issued simultaneously by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to community welfare staff and local housing authority staff respectively.  The guidelines which issued to the local housing authorities advised that they should deal with those presenting with an immediate housing need, by way of social housing accommodation or, where none is available, emergency accommodation until such time as a housing needs assessment is completed. Where emergency accommodation is deemed not appropriate by the relevant local authority, the authority can prioritise the housing needs assessment for this household so that rent support can be provided sooner, where applicable.These procedures, where operated by local housing authorities, should ensure that those with an urgent housing need have their needs met in the most appropriate manner.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	877	I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2008 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks.  However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Those processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact that there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008.  I am advised that there has been a further increase of 39% in the number of appeals received for the first nine months of this year over the corresponding period in 2008 and, while average processing times for 2009 are not yet available, it is anticipated that they will have deteriorated  on the 2008 position.I should say that the processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases and further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required.  Circumstances may also arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals.  For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the appeal proceedings.  In addition, adjournments may be sought by the appellant or his/her representative which would have the effect of prolonging the appeal process.In the vast majority of cases, decisions are made by Appeals Officers within four weeks of an oral hearing.  However, a longer period may be required in more complex cases where further submissions may be awaited or complex issues of law may need to be researched.I am anxious there should be no further deterioration in appeals processing times especially in the light of the 39% increase in the number of appeals received so far this year.  In that connection, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in January.  Since then, however, four Appeals Officers have retired and I am advised that every effort is being made to have these vacancies filled as a matter of urgency.  Furthermore, I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that he is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals.  Given the quasi-judicial nature of the social welfare appeals process, progress in that regard must be achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	878	The current average processing times for the schemes referred to by the Deputy are as follows:SchemeProcessing timeBereavement Grant3 weeksDisability Allowance17 weeksDisability Benefit1 weekDomiciliary Care Allowance8 weeksFamily Income Supplement8 weeksJobseeker’s Allowance4 weeksJobseekers Benefit8 weeksOne-Parent Family Payment13 weeksWidows Pension Contributory4 weeksWidows Pension Non Contributory7 weeksMore than 95% of Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance applications are decided on and paid within the week.In regard to the Guardian's (Contributory and Non Contributory) Payment Scheme, a specific processing target is not set.  This is because factors outside of the Department's control can impinge on claim processing times.  These factors include the need to liaise with outside bodies to obtain the required information to determine entitlement.In compiling statistics to determine average processing times for the various schemes in the Department, the parameter dates are the date the claim was made by the customer (i.e. the registration date) and the date the decision was given by the deciding officer.The Department is committed to processing claims as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary from scheme to scheme.  In some cases there is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary enquiries to enable decisions to be made.  Time can also elapse where the applicants do not supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.  The processing of claims may involve, among other things, the need to establish the customer's social insurance record, verify medical conditions, establish a customer's identity or their place of habitual residence and assess means where appropriate.Additional information or indeed information originally sought but not provided may also have to be requested from the customer.  The figures for pension schemes include claims where a person's date of entitlement has not yet been reached.The Department aims to process claims quickly and efficiently.  In this regard there is a continued emphasis on providing staff with the necessary training and development to ensure they have the requisite knowledge and skills to carry out their work.  Operational procedures, the organisation of work, and the allocation of staff resources continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the processing capability of the scheme areas.  All aspects of claim processing are kept under constant review and improvements are implemented on a continuous basis.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The Live Register has increased to unprecedented levels as a result of the economic downturn that the country is currently experiencing.  This in turn has led to large numbers attending at our offices and the consequent delays that claimants are experiencing.While it is not feasible in most cases to provide shelter for customers queuing outside our offices, a number of initiatives have been introduced to address the extensive queuing problem.  An appointment system for taking claims has been introduced in a number of offices with high volumes.  Under this initiative, when a person first attends at a local office to claim, they are given details of the supporting documents required together with an appointment to make their claims.  The appointment system has been introduced in 16 local offices to date and will be extended to a number of other offices over the coming months having regard to the volume of new claims at particular offices.The signing arrangements for people who are already on the live register have been reviewed at a number of offices and additional signing days have been introduced where necessary.  In addition, at some offices specific signing times have been allocated to claimants to reduce queuing times.The Department has instituted a number of process improvement measures in order to improve the claim taking process.  In addition, it is reviewing the processes involved in administering claims for those who are working reduced hours i.e. part-time, casual and systematic short time.  The existing arrangements are very labour intensive and it is envisaged that more streamlined arrangements which will benefit both customers and the Department will be introduced in the near future.The provision of public toilets is now a standard feature in specifications for new local offices however there are many offices which do not have public toilets.  Where this is the case, staff toilets can be made available to customers such as pregnant women, on request.External post boxes are a standard feature in local offices.  However in some cases these may be inaccessible after hours due to shutters which close over the main entrance door and the letter box.  This issue is currently being examined with a view to resolving it without delay.

The PIPS is intended to make it cheaper to pay for the pensions of retired pension scheme members, so that more money is available for the pension benefits of those who have not yet retired.This scheme uses the definition of insolvency which applies to the insolvency payments scheme administered by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and as set out in the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act 1984.The company mentioned by the Deputy will not qualify for the scheme as it is not an insolvent company as defined in the 1984 Act.As the Deputy knows, some 90% of defined benefit schemes are currently in deficit.  Under the Pensions Act, trustees of these schemes must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to ensure that the financial position of the scheme recovers over time.  The vast majority of underfunded schemes are working with the Pensions Board to comply with the pensions legislation in this regard.  I have no plans, therefore, to extend the qualification criteria for PIPS to cover companies which do not meet the definition of insolvency.

The difference between the level of under-66 and over-66 increases for qualified adults has grown in recent years on foot of a Government commitment to raise the increase for a qualified adult for spouses and partners (age 66 and over) of contributory pensioners to the level of the state pension (non-contributory).  A number of special increases were given over several Budgets in pursuit of this aim.  The increase for a qualified adult now stands at over 94% of the target.

Partly as a result of this and partly as a result of an increase in the number of eligible children, overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008.  The Government is proud to have been able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years.  However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to ensure that they are sustainable and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.It is in this context that the Minister for Finance announced at the time of the Supplementary Budget in April that the Government's intention to either subject child benefit to income tax or means-test it from 2010.  In this regard, the Commission of Taxation was requested to examine the implications of taxing child benefit.The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, was appointed with a mandate to examine all current Exchequer spending across all Departments and agencies, to see where savings might be made.  The reports of the special Group and the Commission on Taxation contain a wide range of proposals relating to my Department's schemes and services, including the child benefit scheme and decisions in relation to these will be made in the context of the forthcoming Budget and subsequent Budgets.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual proposals at this stage.The Government will be mindful of the needs of families, particularly those on lower incomes when deciding on the various options in the forthcoming Budget.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	888	The pension rights of scheme members are protected through trust law and by provision in the Pensions Act 1990 as amended.As supplementary pension schemes are usually established under irrevocable trust, the assets of the scheme are legally separate from the assets of the employer and are not available to any other creditors where the employer becomes insolvent.  Under trust law, trustees of occupational pension schemes have the principal responsibility for ensuring that the entitlements of the members are adequately protected and that they receive the pensions due to them.In addition to the safeguards provided by trust law, the Pensions Act 1990 also provides for the regulation of pensions schemes in Ireland.  Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding, normally within three years.  However, the Pensions Board can now allow a scheme more than ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.Should a scheme be wound up by its trustees, the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) specifies how scheme assets are prioritised. Proposals to address the overall security of pensions are being considered as part of the long-term framework for pensions which the Government will announce shortly.

His claim was disallowed on 30 January 2009 on the grounds that he was not habitually resident in the State.  He was notified of this decision in writing and of his right to appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  He subsequently appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  On 2 September 2009, a Social Welfare Appeals Officer found the person concerned to be not habitually resident in the State for the purpose of qualifying for Disability Allowance.Habitual Residency is a condition which a person must satisfy in order to qualify for certain social welfare assistance payments including disability allowance.  This condition took effect from 1 May 2004 and affects all applicants regardless of nationality.  Satisfying the Habitual Residency condition is just one of the conditions for receiving certain social welfare assistance payments.  A person must also satisfy the other conditions that apply in order to get a payment.  The legislation underpinning Habitual Residence is Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.The 2007 amendment to Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, incorporates into Irish law 5 factors that have been set down in judgements given by the European Court of Justice as relevant to determining whether a person is habitually resident.  These 5 factors are; a person's main centre of interest; the length and continuity of their presence in the Common Travel Area; the length and reason for any absence from the Common Travel Area; the nature and pattern of their employment, if any, in the Common Travel Area and their future intentions to live in the Republic of Ireland as it appears from their particular situation.The list is not exhaustive, no single factor is conclusive and some factors may have more influence than others, depending on a person's particular circumstances.  It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the Habitual residence condition and reach a decision based on the law.

The Executive has advised that the person concerned has made an application for rent supplement and she has been asked to provide further documentary evidence regarding her financial position.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different types of eligible household to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.   The person concerned has been advised to seek accommodation within the relevant prescribed maximum rent limits.

The case was listed for oral hearing which was heard on 24th April 2009.  Normally, a decision is issued within 4-6 weeks, however in this case this is not the situation.  The appeals officers report was received in disability allowance section on 28th September 2009.  The delay involved is being investigated by the chief appeals officer and will write to the Deputy when this investigation is complete.The person concerned has been awarded a Disability Allowance with effect from 30 July 2008 at the maximum personal rate, which is currently €204.30, plus an increase for a qualified child of €26.00 and a Fuel Allowance of €23.90 which gives a weekly total of €254.20.  His first payment will be available to be collected at his Post Office on 28 October 2009.  The person concerned is currently in receipt of One Parent Family Payment at exactly the same rates as mentioned above in respect of Disability Allowance.  As he is only entitled to receive one of these payments arrears will not arise.

Any person who makes a claim for jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, one parent family payment, disability allowance, State pension non-contributory, carer's allowance, widow's non-contributory, guardian's non-contributory payment, blind pension or supplementary welfare allowance must be habitually resident in the State.  People who previously resided in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland are not exempt from being subject to the habitual residence condition except in certain specific circumstances in which the EU Regulations apply.  Nevertheless, a person who has been residing in Northern Ireland and moves residence to this State may find it easier to satisfy this residence condition than people coming from other countries, because of the freedom of movement within the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the relative ease of transferring one's centre of interest across the Border.The EU Regulations, which provide for the protection of the social security rights of migrant workers exercising their right to freedom of movement between EU countries, include provisions which can override national legislation.  The Regulations provide that family benefits (including child benefit) are payable by the State in which the claimant is employed, or by the State which is paying certain benefits, including jobseeker's benefit, following a period of employment in that State.  This applies even where the children are resident in another State. A person who is currently employed in the Republic of Ireland by an Irish employer is therefore entitled to child benefit even if that person and/or his/her children are residing in Northern Ireland.  A person who was last employed in the Republic and, for example, is entitled to Irish jobseeker's benefit (which can be exported for up to 3 months) will be similarly entitled to child benefit for that 3 months period.  Similar EU provisions apply to supplementary welfare allowance which may also be paid in certain circumstances to a person who was last employed in Ireland.  These arrangements do not apply to other payments like jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance which remain subject to the habitual residence condition.

I have no function in these decisions. The person concerned has been in receipt of a reduced rate farm assist with effect from 2 June 2009. Farm income is assessed in accordance with statutory provisions for the assessment of means as provided for under the Social Welfare Act. Under these provisions, capital (including savings and investments) and the value of property owned but not personally used and enjoyed are assessed as means.   The farm means of the person concerned were assessed by the social welfare inspector using receipts supplied with the exception of some items which were estimated, that is, farm electricity/ phone/ car and depreciation. The value of property assessed was based on a letter of valuation provided. Outstanding mortgage was deducted from the overall property valuation figure.At present, a revised means review is being carried out in this case and the person concerned will be informed of the outcome. The question of whether the gift of €10,000 should be taken into account will be considered as part of this review.

The majority of jobseekers are required to sign the Live Register once in any 4-week period. However, to avoid the necessity for people in Lucan to travel to Clondalkin, they may sign-on at a signing centre in Lucan village. The signing centre in Lucan is now open 4 days per month an increase on the two days which previously applied. The Department is keeping this arrangement under review.

It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on certain social welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so. Qualifying payments include the Department's jobseeker payments, disability allowance and lone parent allowance.  There are two study options available under the back to education allowance scheme; second level option (SLO) and third level option (TLO). Under the second level option, a person may attend a second level course of education at any publicly funded Community, Comprehensive, Secondary, Vocational school or Institute of Technology. The course being pursued must be a full-time day course of study and lead to a qualification that is recognised by the Department of Education & Science and awarded by the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) or the Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC).  Under the third level option, a person may attend an approved full-time third level course of education at any university or third level college or institution. Third level courses up to and including those conferring a Higher Diploma in any discipline or a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary & Secondary Teaching) are covered by the scheme.In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study. However, lone parents and recipients of jobseekers' payments who are out of formal education for at least 2 years can qualify at 18 years of age.  Changes to facilitate earlier access to the scheme came into effect from 1st May, 2009. In order to qualify for participation, an applicant must now be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department's facilitator programme. People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers. The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	934	In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the Live Register and the current employment situation, it was decided in the context of the recent supplementary budget to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment.  These changes significantly strengthen the supports for jobseekers wishing to move to self employment.Claimants who qualify for jobseeker's benefit are being afforded immediate access to a new short term enterprise allowance, provided they have 104 contributions paid or have established entitlement to statutory redundancy from their latest period of employment.  It is payable at the same rate and for the same duration as jobseeker's benefit.For jobseekers on the live register, the qualifying period required for access to the back to work enterprise allowance scheme has been reduced from 2 years to 12 months provided an entitlement to jobseeker's allowance is established.  Those who do not have an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance can access the scheme, as before, subject to the 2 year qualifying period.These changes to improve access to the scheme were made in conjunction with a reduction in the period for which the allowance is payable from 4 years to 2 years at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second year.  Furthermore, people who previously participated in the back to work enterprise allowance scheme may apply a second time after a period of at least 5 years has elapsed.The qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changing economic circumstances.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	935	There is an obligation, under Social Welfare legislation, on customers to notify the Department of any change in their circumstances which may affect their entitlement to payment.  Customers are informed of this requirement when notified of the decision on their claim and at subsequent reviews.When a person in receipt of a social welfare payment enters full-time permanent nursing home care they continue to be entitled to their payment, and if aged 70 years and over also remain eligible for the telephone allowance.The only area where a change in entitlements can arise is where the person is in receipt of Household Benefits — electricity or gas and free television licence.  Where a person fails to notify the Department of their change of address, there is a range of control measures in place to address such circumstances.  For example:The various utility companies notify the Department where there is a change of address on a customer's account or where supply is terminated.  Payment is immediately suspended in all such cases.When notification of a change of address is received on any payment scheme where household benefit is also in payment, the household benefit claim is automatically stopped.Only one household benefits claim is payable per household and controls are in place to prevent payment of more than one entitlement at the same address.Special projects are undertaken to review customer's ongoing entitlement having regard to specific review criteria.In addition, regular reviews are undertaken to determine a person's ongoing entitlement to household benefits.  Customers are issued with continuing eligibility certificates for completion and return within a specified time.The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them and to ensuring that abuse of the system is prevented and dealt with effectively when detected.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	939	Under the Pensions Act 1990, defined benefit pension (DB) schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.The Pensions Act, and associated regulations, prescribe that defined benefit schemes are required to assess once every year whether they meet the funding standard. Not all schemes have the same reporting date, but the Pensions Board in its Annual Report for 2008 estimated that approximately 90% of defined benefit schemes did not meet the funding standard.Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding, normally within three years.However, as a result of the economic difficulties, the Government introduced a number of temporary measures aimed at easing the pressures being experienced by schemes.Those measures include:The granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals;Granting flexibility to the Pensions Board to allow longer periods (over 10 years) for recovery plans in appropriate circumstances;Enabling the Board to allow the term of a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan in certain circumstances; andEnabling the Board to take into account voluntary employer guarantees in approving recovery plans.It is likely that, as a result of recent improvements in investment markets, the solvency of most schemes has improved. However, the situation is still a cause for concern, and I encourage scheme trustees and sponsoring employers to continue to work with the Pensions Board to address funding issues as a matter of urgency.

Notwithstanding this, the Green Paper on Pensions, published in October 2007, discussed the issue of raising state pension age as a measure to assist with the sustainability of the public pension system and to strengthen inter-generational solidarity. As was pointed out in the Green Paper, people are now living longer and healthier lives, with the time spent in retirement now much longer than was previously the case. This creates sustainability pressures for both occupational pension schemes as well as state pensions. Other countries have already announced increases in state pension age.While Ireland currently has a relatively younger population than other countries, it is expected that, by mid century, we will have only two people of working age to every pensioner compared to six people of working age at present. The Green Paper projected that population ageing would give rise to a substantial increase in age-related expenditure, of which pension provision is expected to be the single largest component. Increasing state pension age is one option to help address these spending pressures.The Government is currently finalising a national pensions framework which will be published before the end of the year. Any decisions on amending state pension age will be made in that context.

This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed people pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same people enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance. They can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services. In general their earnings level in the last twelve months is the basis for determining their expected income for the following year. However, in the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and it is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years. This is factored in projecting future earnings, with account being taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.Similarly, any person who does not satisfy the social insurance contribution criteria for the State Pension (Contributory) may apply for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), the award of which is, inter alia, subject to a means test.In addition, self-employed persons who are no longer covered by compulsory PRSI can opt to pay Voluntary Contributions if they meet the necessary requirements. Payment of Voluntary Contributions can help to maintain or improve an individual's contributory pension entitlement. Self-employed persons pay a special rate of Voluntary Contributions and the current amount payable is €253 per year.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	946	Earlier this year, my Department initiated a tender competition for the supply of Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) equipment for four from twenty-seven Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles that are being supplied by BAE Systems in South Africa.  Following a detailed evaluation of tenders, the contract for the award of the Surveillance and Target acquisition equipment, with a value of €2.37m inclusive of VAT, was awarded to Elbit Systems Limited in Israel. The four Surveillance and Target Acquisition Suites ordered for use with four of the Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles are required to enhance the capability of the Irish Defence Forces to carry out surveillance and target acquisition for overseas Peace Support Operations. They will be used as an information-gathering asset and will provide a means to enhance force protection and the safety of Irish troops whilst on such missions.My Department conducts tender competitions in accordance with EU procurement guidelines.  For procurements of defensive equipment in excess of €1million, the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement is observed and competitions are advertised by the European Defence Agency as was the case with the tender competition for the Surveillance and Target Acquisition suite.  Tender competitions are held in accordance with the EU Code of Conduct on Export Controls. The tender competitions are open to companies in individual countries in accordance with the terms of all United Nations, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and European Union arms embargos or restrictions.  Neither Elbit Systems Limited nor Israel have had embargos or restrictions imposed on them under the terms of these organisations.  The Department of Defence is obliged to deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria set out in the tender documentation.The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders.  The acquisition of the four Surveillance and Target Acquisition Suites followed on from such a tender competition.

The Defence Forces have a very good relationship with the Argentinean Military primarily through the Admiral Brown Naval connection. The achievements of Admiral William Brown, originally from Foxford, Co. Mayo, as founder of the Argentine Navy and a key contributor to national independence, has led to a number of mutual naval service visits in recent years.The Argentine Naval Sail Training Vessel the ARA Libertad visited Dublin in June this year, and 100 Argentine Naval Cadets, along with the Acting Argentine Ambassador to Ireland, visited Foxford, Co Mayo in connection with Admiral Brown on 18 June. Lt Gen Earley visited Argentina as part of an Irish delegation in 2007.The Defence Forces and the Argentinean Armed Forces are developing an exchange training programme. An Irish officer attended a course in Argentina in September 2008. Opportunities for return visits by Argentinean Officers are being explored.The Argentine Armed Forces have served in various peace keeping / enforcing missions around the world including United Nations Truce Supervision Organization where they served with members of the Defence Forces. The Argentine Armed Forces also served with United Nations Peace keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (SFOR) and as observers with the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).

The determination of the annual rate on valuation which is applied to property valuation to calculate rates is a decision taken locally by the elected members of a local authority in their annual budget.I have no plans to introduce a rates subsidy scheme that would favour one commercial sector over another.  However, to support economic activity and employment, both nationally and locally, and to protect the interests of communities, I specifically requested that local authorities exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates in their 2009 Budgets.  Local authorities recognise the challenging environment in which business operates and have responded positively to this request.I am cognizant of the importance of rates income as a contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities.  These services are of considerable benefit to all, including ratepayers and business generally.  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under review.

Where such communal facilities are not provided, the Guidelines say that consideration needs to be given to the provision of drying facilities within each unit, such as the use of screened balconies.  A copy of the Guidelines is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie. Incorporating appropriate outdoor drying facilities into the design of apartment developments may have environmental merit and, taking into account practical implementation issues such as space, privacy and security, my Department will consider the proposal further in the context of any future review of the Guidelines.

A Project Team, led by the Limerick Regeneration Agencies, was established in 2009 to deliver detailed plans for two new sheltered housing projects in Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston.  Some €1.5 million is set aside in 2009 to meet these design costs and it is intended that priority projects in the Southill and St. Mary's Park areas will be added to the Project Team's remit.The broader economic and employment situation in Limerick and the Mid-West region is under consideration in light of the Interim Report of the Mid-West Task Force. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment published the Task Force's Interim Report on 28 July 2009 and the Government is now engaging in a cross-Departmental consultation process to evaluate and consider the implementation of the report's recommendations.

The process has included discussions with a number of organisations, bodies, public agencies and interests active in the area.  The draft Bill is being designed to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the Working Group that had been established to review the management of dog breeding establishments.  The Working Group recommended that a dog breeding establishment be defined as ‘a premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential'.The draft Bill will propose that dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, that they pay a registration fee and that they meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards, together with some associated requirements.The Hunting Association of Ireland (HAI) made submissions to me in relation to their activities and the nature of these.  As a consequence and in recognition of the "not for profit" basis of these, and as communicated to the HAI directly and in response to representations on their behalf, I decided to provide exemption in the legislation in respect of the payment of registration fees.  The HAI has made clear that their premises operate comprehensive and appropriate standards. Accordingly, I do not consider that this aspect of the legislative regime should cause difficulty.

To assist local authorities in this process, the EPA has developed a dedicated web site.  However the web site is not, and is not intended to be, a register of contaminated sites.Under the Waste Management (Certification of Historic Unlicensed Waste Disposal and Recovery Activity) Regulations 2008 local authorities are obliged to identify and register by 30 June 2009 all closed unlicensed landfills which were operated by them during the period 15 July 1977 to 27 March 1997, i.e. in the period between the adoption of relevant EU requirements and their having full effect in Ireland through the waste licensing system now the statutory responsibility of the EPA.  My Department understands from the EPA that all local authorities have complied with this registration requirement.Local authorities are also required, under section 26(2) of the Acts, to identify and assess sites at which waste disposal activities were carried out that to a significant extent involved hazardous waste.  The EPA in 2007 published a Code of Practice for Environmental Risk Assessment for Unregulated Waste Disposal Sites.  The code provides the framework for local authorities to establish any environmental risk posed by such sites.

While certain developments are exempted under section 4 of the Act and Part 2 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, there is no specific exemption for car parks.  A change in the use of land is development for the purpose of the legislation, but planning permission is not required for a change of use within any one of the classes of use specified in Part 4 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations.The interpretation and application of the legislation is a matter the planning authorities in the first instance.

Of that total, 60 households have been accommodated to date in 2009.  The Council have advised my Department that they will meet their 2009 target of transferring 200 rent supplement households to RAS (150) and social housing (50).It is a matter for each individual authority to manage the transfer of rent supplement households to RAS and my Department has no function in the transfer of individual cases.  The qualifying criteria for RAS are that a household must be in receipt of rent supplement, usually for 18 months or more and have a long term housing need.  Households in part-time employment are not precluded from the scheme.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. It states that the Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  The question of the use of postcodes for electoral registration purposes would appropriately arise for consideration in this context.

No. 670 of 2007.  Matters such as the assessment and approval of individual applications and the payment of grants to householders, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.The combined allocation to Mayo County Council, incorporating the Exchequer contribution and the co funding provided by Council, for 2009, was €2,775,834,  an increase of 14% on the  2008 allocation.The annual allocations to local authorities under the schemes are calculated on foot of detailed discussion between my Department and the local authorities and on the basis of a number of criteria, including the level of applications on hand that have been assessed as eligible, applications yet to be assessed and projections for new applications to be received during the year.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.  There are no undue delays in recouping grant expenditure to the local authorities and, nationally, some 75% of the overall Exchequer contribution has been recouped to local authorities to date.At my Department's request, the Centre for Housing Research is currently carrying out an evaluation of the grant schemes in consultation with stakeholders, including the local authorities, representative organisations for older people and persons with a disability, and with a cross-section of grant applicants.  The need for revised guidelines with regard to the payment of grants by local authorities to approved applicants will be considered in the light of the evaluation report.

The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, as amended, requires that all candidates, both successful and unsuccessful, furnish a statement of election expenses and statutory declaration to the local authority concerned within 90 days following polling day.Section 20(1) of the Act provides that where an unsuccessful candidate fails to furnish the relevant statement within the specified period, the person shall be disqualified for membership of any local authority for the remainder of the term of office of the members of the local authority concerned.Section 20(2) of the Act provides that where a member of a local authority elected at the election fails to furnish to the local authority concerned, within the period specified for this purpose, the relevant statement, the member shall be suspended from membership of the authority for the period of 7 days commencing on the expiry of the time specified for this purpose, or a lesser period ending on the compliance by the member with the requirements of section 13, and if at the end of that period the member has not complied with the requirements of section 13, the member shall be disqualified for membership of any local authority.In the case of an unsuccessful candidate who failed to furnish a statement to the local authority concerned, there is no scope to provide for a suspension from membership of that local authority.The requirement to submit a statement of election expenses and statutory declaration, and the disqualification provisions that apply for non-submission, have been in effect for the local elections held in 1999, 2004 and 2009.  I consider that 90 days is more than adequate to make a return, and would be reluctant to relax the provisions currently contained in the legislation.However, if practical issues emerge with the implementation of legislation, then I will, of course, consider them to determine any action that may be required.

In accordance with the Directive, Ireland has nominated certain raised and blanket bogs, which are priority natural habitats under the Directive, as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs).   In addition, Ireland has also designated other raised and blanket bogs as natural heritage areas (NHAs) under the 2000 Wildlife Act.  All raised and blanket bog, SACs  and NHAs are listed in the table below.My Department provides funding for compensation of turf cutters who cease cutting and for the  purchase of freehold or turbary rights on these designated sites with a view to their protection and, where appropriate, restoration.

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within the appropriate period, the planning authority must also initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners/occupiers.  The decision as whether any particular estates should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provide respectively that a planning authority may attach conditions to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a proposed development and, if a development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply the security given for the satisfactory completion of that development.My Department's Development Management Guidelines (June 2007) and policy guidance on the Taking in Charge of Residential Developments (February 2008) advise that it is essential that planning permissions for residential developments are subject to conditions under which an acceptable security is provided by way of bond, cash deposit or otherwise so as to secure the satisfactory completion of those developments.  The guidance states that the security given should be adequate to ensure the proper completion of roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open space and the lodgment of the security should be coupled with an agreement that would empower the authority to realise the amount of the security at an appropriate time.

The introduction of the levy at the rate of 15 cent per bag in 2002 led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers, from an estimated 328 bags per person per year prior to the introduction of the levy to 21 bags per person by the end of 2002, with a consequent positive environmental benefit.However, there followed a gradual increase in plastic bag usage which, by the period January to June 2007, had risen to an estimated 33 bags per person.  In order to counteract this trend the levy was increased to 22 cent with effect from July 2007. Plastic bag consumption subsequently dropped to 26 bags per person for the period July 2007 to December 2007 but has climbed back to 27 bags per person for 2008.Under Section 72(7) and (8) of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by Section 9 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001, it is only possible to increase the plastic levy in line with changes in the consumer price index. The increase in the levy to 22 cent per bag in July 2007 was in accordance with this legislation and, while it did reduce plastic bag usage somewhat, it was not successful in bringing plastic bag usage back to the level achieved when the levy was first introduced in 2002.This demonstrates that greater flexibility is required, both in setting the plastic bag levy rate and in amending the level of charge as circumstances require.  I will bring forward legislation to provide for this required flexibility and a Regulatory Impact Analysis has been carried out in respect of this proposed legislation.  While the provisions of the proposed legislation would allow for an increase to 44 cent, any amendment to the level of charge will have regard to both the level of plastic bag usage and changes in the consumer price index.

My Department received proposals in July 2009 from Mayo County Council for progressing the scheme to construction on the basis of the tenders received by the Council. The Department, following discussions with the Council, is now awaiting additional information on these proposals from the Council.Local authorities were asked in July to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  These assessments will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme, which it is anticipated will be published in early 2010.

Earlier this year, following an extensive consultation process, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was prepared in my Department and approved by the Government.  The Noise Nuisance Bill is included in Section A of the Government Legislation Programme published on 16 September, 2009.While there are already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, it is my aim that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to noise pollution, including through codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations. There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of how noise nuisance can be addressed and to strengthen existing local authority powers including through a system of fixed payment notices in relation to noise nuisance offences.  The Bill will also extend to An Garda Síochána some of the more appropriate improved powers of the local authority authorised officers.

If the application form submitted is incomplete it will be returned by the PRTB and the late fee will apply unless it is resubmitted within the month.  I understand that currently some 30% of tenancy registration applications submitted to the PRTB by landlords are incomplete, placing a heavy additional administrative burden on the PRTB.The registration fee for a single tenancy is €70; a tenancy registration submitted outside of the one month period is required to pay an additional fee of €70. In no instance where a tenancy registration form has been properly completed and submitted within the one month period is any additional fee charged.

This has been considered in my Department, and it is intended to request the Council to give further consideration to the extent of lands that might be included in such an area.  Also in February 2009, my Department requested Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Kildare County Council to carry out evaluations of lands in the Liffey valley which fall within their functional areas, in order to assess the suitability of some or all of these lands being designated as part of an extended area of special amenity.  Responses have been received from each of these planning authorities and are under consideration.My Department is finalising its consideration of the relevant information and I will shortly decide whether to give a direction under section 202(2) of the Act regarding the making of a further special amenity area order or orders.

This proposal is under assessment and further information will be required prior to my Department making a formal determination of the project's suitability for inclusion in the leasing programme. All leasing proposals submitted to my Department are assessed in accordance with the terms set out in circular N3/09 and the accompanying guidance document, which my Department issued in February 2009.  The leasing initiative is designed to widen further the sources of supply for social housing and thereby help create a flexible range of delivery mechanisms for local authorities to meet the demand for housing.The initiative will also maximise the level of social housing need that can be met from available public resources, responding to a much greater level of housing needs than could be delivered by relying solely on construction and acquisition programmes.  It will also bring into active use some of the vacant housing stock throughout the country.  However it is essential that all State investment in housing support, including use of the new leasing arrangements, complies fully with the "sustainable communities" philosophy at the heart of the Government's housing policy, as outlined in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities . In this regard, authorities must have regard to the concentration of social housing in a particular development or in the general area where property leasing is proposed.

Section 14 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 empowers a housing authority to refuse to sell a dwelling to a tenant where the authority considers that the tenant is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour or that a sale to that tenant would not be in the interest of good estate management.  The scheme provides for a discount of 3% of the market value of the house being purchased for each year of reckonable tenancy, up to a maximum of 30%.  In addition to this, a further discount of €3,809 is provided.  Article 7 of the Housing (Sale of Houses) Regulations 1995 (as substituted by article 2 of the Housing (Sale of Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 1999) specifies the meaning of the expression "reckonable tenancy" for discount purposes, while article 12 of the 1995 regulations provides that a housing authority shall not sell a dwelling to a tenant with reckonable tenancy of less than 1 year.

Under section 15A(4) of the Electoral Act 1992, as inserted by section 7 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, an application by an elector to have his or her name entered in the supplement to the postal  voters list, which is received by the registration authority on or after the third day after the date of the making of the order appointing polling day at a  referendum shall not have effect in relation to that referendum.As the polling day order fixes the polling day, it is not possible to advertise the definitive closing date for the postal voters' supplement in advance of the order being made.  The polling day order for the 2009 Lisbon Treaty Referendum was made on 13 July and, accordingly, the closing date for the supplement to the postal voters list was 15 July.  My Department notified advertisements to the print media immediately on the making of the polling day order and these were widely published on the 14 and 15 July.

Exports of waste are classified as either amber waste, applicable to waste going for disposal, or green waste, for non-hazardous waste going for recovery.  Amber listed waste is subject to prior written notification and the consent of both the competent authority of origin and destination. Green listed waste is subject to prior notification and an accompanying information document to track the shipment.Dublin City Council is the designated national competent authority for the implementation of the Regulation and they are responsible for the control of all exports of waste.  The inspection of consignments of waste to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements is an inherent part of the competent authority's functions, with the level of such inspections an operational issue for the authority.

The proposed amendment provides for the extension of permission (for a period of up to 5 years) in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out, but there are commercial, economic or technical considerations, beyond the control of the applicant, which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works.While the Government has been careful to ensure that the process of correction in the housing market is not artificially interfered with, a number of steps have been taken to ensure that in so far as possible mortgage finance is available to households who want to buy or build houses at this time.  In this regard, the Government announced the introduction of a new mortgage scheme in the context of Budget 2009. The Home Choice Loan has been introduced through the local government system, backed by loan finance raised by the Housing Finance Agency.  Home Choice Loan is now available to first time buyers of new houses or self-builds, subject to a maximum loan of €285,000 or maximum Loan To Value (LTV) of 92% (whichever is the lesser) and income thresholds. The scheme commenced on 1 January 2009.In addition, the Government's recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland included a Credit Package under which the banks committed to, amongst other things, providing an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. The banks also committed to actively promote mortgage lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.

There are no plans to engage in further consultations.The NPPB was established to recommend the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland and to look at the costs and benefits and implementation of postcodes and recommended an alpha-numeric post code model taking the form of ABC 123.  The precise postcode nomenclature and the allocation of individual postcodes will not be finalised until the body that will be charged with implementing postcodes is appointed.There is nothing in the proposal to prevent a person from using a form of address in either of the official languages of the State.  Additionally, in the case of towns located in the Gaeltacht there is nothing in the recommendation that would prevent the postcode utilising letters from the official Irish language version of the place name.

A householder installing only an efficient boiler with heating controls is eligible for a grant of €700, and so will exceed the threshold and be eligible for the Scheme.  Likewise, a householder installing just internal or external wall insulation will qualify.  For the lower cost measures such as roof or cavity wall insulation, the householder can qualify by combining just two measures, for example roof insulation and heating controls together attract a grant of €750.To be eligible for the grant for wall insulation, the householder must insulate all external walls.  Likewise, roof insulation must cover the full roof space.  Partial solutions are not supported under the Scheme, as SEI's position is that they are not an optimal solution and they offer poor value for money to the householder and the Exchequer.  The cost of installing the various qualifying measures is market driven.  In the current competitive environment, householders can get best value for money by shopping around and comparing costs between contractors.  The grants available under the Scheme represent a very generous contribution of around 30% of installation costs for the average home.

These species include freshwater fish of any kind, salmon, sea bass, tope, eels, mussels and oysters.  The process of securing foreshore licences as referred in Parliamentary Questions 1062 and 1063 of 16 September 2009 does not affect fishing as this does not involve usage of the foreshore as in the case of aquaculture.

My Department is currently in discussion with the European Commission with a view to successfully progressing the State Aid clearance over the coming months.  In order to be eligible for REFIT, developers will require planning permission, foreshore permits, signed grid connection offers and an offer of a power purchase agreement from a registered supply company.The next grouping of renewable electricity grid connection offers, which includes around 800 MW of offshore wind projects, referred to as the Gate 3 process, is currently under way and the new tariffs will facilitate some of these developers involved in this process to progress their projects through the financial planning stages.  There are no offshore wind projects currently eligible to apply for the REFIT scheme until the connection offer process has been completed.

While the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will be implemented by the end of 2010, will ensure broadband is available to almost all parts of the country, a small number of premises in areas not covered by the NBS will still not be capable of receiving broadband services. This is primarily due to technical difficulties and other reasons (distance from nearest DSL enabled telephone exchange, no line of sight etc).My Department is currently examining options around the design of a scheme under the EERP to make service available to such premises in rural areas. It is hoped to commence this Scheme in 2010 and conclude it by 2011. A critical first step is to apply for and secure State Aid clearance from the European Commission. This dialogue has already begun.

The development of renewable energy is however, a priority for myself and the Government.  In 2008, renewable electricity was at 12.2% of all electricity generated, up from 5% in 2004.  Ireland is on target to meet its target of 15% by 2010.The "All Island Grid Study" published early last year, examines the ability of the electricity systems on an All-Island basis to absorb power from renewable energy powered projects.  Its finding shows that a target of 42% is feasible without any major increase in pumped storage.  The Study is not prescriptive on the alternative technologies, including pumped storage, which a liberalised electricity market may bring forward to balance customer demand and supply as the renewable energy powered capacity increases.  I understand that several private developers are understood to be currently examining proposals which may lead to additional pumped storage projects being developed.  In the context of the continued development of renewable energy, and wind in particular, on the Irish electricity system, Sustainable Energy Ireland, EirGrid and ESB, together with the energy sector, will continue to keep developments and proposals in relation to pumped storage hydro facilities under close review.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	As Ireland's largest indigenous, manufacturing sector the agrifood sector is crucial to sustaining and reinvigorating the economy.  Strategies for the development of a consumer focused, competitive and sustainable agrifood sector at home and abroad are set out in the Agri-vision 2015 report and the Cawley Report.  These strategies identify the delivery of safe, high quality, nutritious food, produced in a sustainable manner in high value markets as the optimum road for the future of the Irish food industry in the light of the changes which have already taken place or are anticipated over the next number of years and span the entire food chain from primary production through processing to market access which is key to developing export potential.Bord Bia, under the aegis of my Department, is the state agency responsible for market development of food, seafood, drink and horticulture at home and abroad and closely monitors food exports.  It has published a Strategy to boost food exports for the period 2009-2011.  The strategy's six key priorities include enhancing the industry's position on its home market and export expansion with a particular emphasis on Eurozone markets.Bord Bia has a comprehensive set of marketing and promotional programmes in place, which have been developed in consultation with key stakeholders in the food industry.  The schedule of marketing activities for 2009 has regard to the impact of the sterling differential on competitiveness and include:Food Ingredients/Nutraceuticals (Europe), which will provide industry with detailed market requirements particularly for dairy ingredients.Participation in Trade Fairs in Paris, Madrid, Portugal and Amsterdam, mentoring on supplying Continental supermarket groups and provision of market insights.Private Label seminar (Scandinavia, Germany & Holland) with company specific mentoring and Private Label Manufacturers Association trade fair in Amsterdam.On the home market, Bord Bia's Quality Assurance schemes for various products are well known.  This year Bord Bia has also introduced a ‘Best in Season' promotional campaign for locally grown produce in season promotes seasonal local produce.  This highlights to consumers which fruit and vegetables are available in Ireland and when they are in season.  The key messages include freshness, taste and health benefits.  Press and digital media and a best in season website (www.bestinseason.ie) have focused on strawberries in June, new season potatoes in July and seasonally available vegetables and potatoes in a "back to school" theme for September on emphasising the important role play in a healthy balanced diet for children, particularly as the winter months approach.The Good Practice Standard and Flag for Farmers' Markets which was launched at the Bloom 2009 Festival encourages farmers markets to provide market access to locally produced in-season produce.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1038 to 1040, inclusive, together.The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for the enforcement of this legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (F.S.A.I.).Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009.Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, my Department had taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific labelling legislation since September 2000.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.  In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling.  However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.There is no statutory requirement in place to define the percentage of Irish raw materials to be used for agrifood in order to allow companies to market and label their products as Irish.  There is also the issue where a primary product can enter Ireland and be processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded, as an Irish product, this is known as "substantial transformation".  This terminology originates in WTO, CODEX and EU Legislation governing the EU Custom Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  This was one of the principal points made to the European Commission in the context of our request for their approval of our proposed national arrangements.The issue of more informative and clear labelling will continue to be pursued by the Department of Health and Children at EU level in the context of the current review. We are pressing for the inclusion of a requirement to indicate the origin of primary ingredients in finished products.In the meantime products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.  There is also an industry lead campaign that allows products carry "The Love Irish Food" logo providing 80% of the product's manufacturing process took place in this state and if ingredients were sourced locally where possible.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1049	REPS 3 was a measure introduced under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2000-2006. Under Supplementary Measure 6 of REPS 3, it was possible for a farmer to receive an organic payment in addition to his basic REPS payment. A new stand alone Organic Farming Scheme was introduced under the Organic Farming Measure of the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013. Under this programme, the EU ruled that in order for a farmer to avail of the Organic Farming Scheme if they were in either REPS 2 or REPS 3, they had to transform to REPS 4. The EU decided that a situation was not allowed whereby a farmer could be in REPS 3 under one rural development programme and in the Organic Farming Scheme under another.  It is therefore not possible for the person named to join the Organic Farming Scheme while still holding REPS 3 commitments. The person named ceases his commitments in REPS 3 on 30th November 2010 and would be allowed join the Organic Farming Scheme at that stage if the Scheme is still in operation.The Organic Farming Scheme is currently suspended.  My colleague, Mr. Trevor Sargent TD, Minister for Food and Horticulture, Fisheries and Food recently announced the outcome of the review of the Scheme, under which support is paid to farmers in the sector.  It is the Department's intention, subject to the outcome of the estimates process, to re-open the Organic Farming Scheme from 1 January, 2010 with revised scheme conditions.  The amount of funding available for the Organic Farming Scheme will be determined later in the year when the Government are preparing the estimates for 2010.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1052	The Dundalk Cockle fishery was reopened on 30 September 2009. As the fishery operates in a conservation area designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives, access to the fishery is strictly limited as required under the published Fisheries Natura Plan. The access rules were put in place taking into account the scientific advice on the outtake of the fishery. Access to the fishery was restricted to those applicants with licensed and registered vessels that could show track record of having targeted cockles in Dundalk Bay in any of the years from 2004-2007, inclusive.   In addition, persons could apply for a permit to hand gather cockles.    The application forms for the fishery were publicly advertised on 22 September 2009.  Vessel owners who applied and met these conditions were granted Permits to fish and all hand gatherers who applied were granted Permits.  The application period is now closed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1053	There are approximately 29,000 REPS 4 participants, including 16,380 new applications received in 2009, eligible for payment in 2009.  In accordance with the requirements of EU regulations, a comprehensive administrative check must be carried out on new applications received in 2009 before the first instalment of 75% of the 2009 payment can be released to these and to those already in the scheme.  The administrative checking process is currently under way with a view to commencing payments as soon as possible.  If all new applicants prove eligible for payment, the 75% payment would amount to approximately €105 million.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1056	Farmers who obtain a derogation from the Nitrates Regulations, allowing them to operate at a level up to 250 kg organic nitrogen per hectare, are eligible to join REPS 4.  This provision was approved by the European Commission as part of the current Rural Development Programme.  However the 170 kg limit was a condition of the Commission's approval for REPS 3 under the previous Rural Development Plan and forms part of the basis for the level of payment under that scheme.  It is therefore binding on all participants.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1057	An application under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 11 May 2009.The Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.The person named was written to on 21 September 2009 and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the numbers of livestock maintained on his farm, as Department records currently do not show the person named as having yet achieved the minimum stocking density.  On receipt of a satisfactory response from the person named, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1062	Eight plants have been approved in this country to render animal by-products (ABP) in accordance with the terms of Regulation (EC) 1774 of 2002. All of these plants operate under the supervision of my Department. Four of the plants are approved as Category 1 plants and can deal with all types of ABP, including specified risk material. The other four are Category 3 plants dealing with lower risk material.  Meat plants also have the option, subject to authorization in accordance with regulatory requirements, of sending material for disposal outside this jurisdiction.  During 2008 the eight rendering plants in this country took in 509,383 tonnes of raw ABP from meat plants and this was converted to 142,365 tonnes of meat and bonemeal (MBM) and 72,544 tonnes of tallow.  It is my policy to encourage alternative disposal options for ABP, including MBM and tallow, with a view to maximizing added value.The consequence of the ban on the use of MBM in animal feed, due to its association with the spread of BSE, was that MBM for some years had to be exported for incineration at significant cost. In recent years however increasing amounts of MBM have been put to beneficial use. For instance between 2006 and 2008 the proportion of MBM exported for incineration declined from 61% to 45%. During the same period export for technical use increased from 21% to 39%. MBM is also now being used as a co-fuel in the cement industry and Category 3 MBM is increasingly being used as an ingredient in fertiliser and in petfood. I am also aware of a number of proposals to use MBM as a fuel to generate electricity.Tallow has a number of uses. Category 3 tallow can be used in animal feed and is also used by the pharmaceutical industry. Both Category 1 and Category 3 tallow can be used as boiler fuel and it is a valuable substitute for imported heavy-duty oil.  The price charged for the disposal of material arising from the cattle processing industry is a matter for the market to decide but it is my belief that the beneficial uses of MBM and tallow which I have outlined above will help to keep down the cost of rendering for the cattle processing industry.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1063	REPS 4 was closed to new applicants in July against the background of the situation in the public finances, the resources available to the Department and the increase, over the past year, from just under 47,000 to some 63,000 in the number of REPS participants.    A record 17,000 applications were received up to the closing date of 15 May for 2009, and further applications which were received up to the time of closure will be processed as applications for 2010.  Payments due to REPS farmers for 2009 will be the highest ever and all participants already in REPS will continue to receive annual payments until their current contracts run their course.I plan to introduce a new agri-environment scheme in 2010 which will reduce compliance costs to participants and which will provide a menu of targeted actions from which farmers may choose.   Funding for the new scheme will include the additional modulation funds which I ensured will be retained for the benefit of Irish farmers in the negotiations on the CAP "Health Check".  It will also include additional matching Exchequer funding. The details of the scheme are in the process of being finalised  and will require the approval of the European Commission, which has already received an outline of our proposals.

This framework commenced in February 2008.  The framework agreement is intended to maximise volume discounts and provide for reductions in administrative and transaction costs for providers and public sector purchasers.  My Department has run a number of competitions under the framework for its mobile voice and data services during 2008 and 2009. Both O2 and Vodafone have been successful in separate competitions, in each case the successful vendor was the most economically advantageous response. My own mobile phone service is included in one of these contracts, currently held with Vodafone, which will be tendered again during 2010.

Therefore, those pupils including siblings, who reside 4.8 kilometres or more from their nearest Gael Choláiste and who choose to attend a Gael Choláiste other than their nearest may only avail of transport from the catchment boundary.I should add that the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, is due to be completed by the end of 2009.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General may direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The responsibility also includes identifying appropriate educational placements for individual children with special educational needs.My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education. It is open to the parents concerned to raise any queries they may have relating to their child's special educational needs directly with the school authorities or with the local SENO. The parent may contact the SENO using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.The Deputy will be further aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that home tuition has recently been approved for the child in question.

Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene on behalf of any particular student.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1084	I understand, following consultation between the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and FÁS, that the funding referred to by the Deputy is the funding for grant assistance that was targeted by FÁS at persons in employment towards the cost of participation on a particular course in the higher education institution also referred to by the Deputy. This funding was awarded on a year by year basis by FÁS, under its Training of People in Employment programmes, subject to available funding being available.  I further understand that while FÁS did fund students on this particular course, the numbers being funded have declined over recent years.  Responsibility for funding decisions in relation to such programmes are a matter for FÁS and I have no role in the matter.Regarding the provision of funding support by my Department towards fees and maintenance support for this course, as referred to by the Deputy, the position is that under the terms of my Department's free fees schemes the exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible full-time students who are pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of study in an approved institution.  Students eligibility for free tuition fees is determined by each individual institution.Currently my Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) Courses. The Higher Education Grant Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my  Department; the other three maintenance grant schemes are administered on a similar basis by the VECs.   Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC.  Candidates wishing to apply for the means-tested maintenance grant should apply, if they have not already done so, to their local VEC to establish eligibility.

The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on the Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable.It should be noted that teacher allocations for all second level schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules based on recognised pupil enrolments on the 30th of September of the preceding school year. Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. The appointment of teachers to posts within the approved quota is a matter for the authorities of the schools concerned.Physical education will continue to play an important role in providing a broad and balanced education programme for students. The evidence available to date would not suggest there has been a significant diminution or marginalisation of the subject recently in schools.  An evaluation of inspection reports undertaken by my Department in 2008 indicates that the vast majority of schools are timetabling PE. However, the reports showed that 22% of schools did not provide the subject for the all students in senior cycle. In such cases, the provision was either not provided for final year students (13%), not provided at all for senior cycle (4%) or provided for only part of the year (4%). If issues emerge during a school inspection which indicate that a programme is not being implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Department, these matters are brought to the attention of the school board of management for attention.

Each post-primary school has been provided with a defined number of hours of substitution cover outside of the supervision and substitution scheme to provide cover for teacher absences arising from uncertified sick leave and official school business.  This was calculated on the basis of the number of pupils in a school with a minimum number of available hours for all schools with less than 100 pupils.  Thus for the 2009/2010 school year 0.31 hours substitution cover was allocated for each pupil in a school as per the school's recognised pupil enrolment on the 30th September 2008.  Examples are an allocation of 62 hours for a 200 pupil school and 124 hours for a 400 pupil school.It is a matter for the managerial authority of each school to decide on the use  of the hours provided.  The supervision/ substitution scheme also continues to operate and teachers who undertake the duties in accordance with the terms of the scheme continue to receive the annual payment.

This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social & Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. This information has been circulated to all existing school Patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school, should it be required. The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.The Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out an analysis of each of these locations, including the two areas referred to by the Deputy, in order to identify the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014/2015.When the required reports have been completed for these initial areas selected the Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.   I will arrange to have a list of the initial areas identified for analysis forwarded to the Deputy for her information.

The parents have been notified of this decision.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1090	The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school concerned.  It is the policy of my Department that unqualified personnel should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted.  Unqualified personnel should therefore only be employed for short periods pending the recruitment of a fully qualified teacher.  I have indicated my intention to commence Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act in the near future.  I have also indicated that the commencement of the section will also provide for it to be regulated that a school may employ unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in extreme circumstances.My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The SESS facilitates a partnership approach involving support teams of practising teachers, Education Centres, the Inspectorate, the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Council for Special Education, Third Level Colleges, Health Board Personnel, Teacher Unions and other relevant bodies and services.Parents of children with autism now have three distinct choices available to them depending on the needs of the child; their child can either attend a mainstream class in their local school with additional supports as required, they can attend a special class in a mainstream school or they can attend a special school.  While some children with autism can thrive in a mainstream class, special classes in both mainstream and special schools have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who require more intensive support.My Department's Inspectorate carried out an Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) which was published in 2006.  The report looked at the education that is provided for children with autism in a variety of settings nationwide, including mainstream classes supporting children with autism.I am satisfied with the current policy of providing schools who have special classes for children with autism with qualified teachers, low pupil teacher ratios, a minimum of 2 special needs assistants per class, access to professional development as well as training courses in autism specific interventions, enhanced capitation and grants for specialist equipment and furniture, if required, together with special school transport arrangements.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1091	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1102 and 1103 together.Resource teaching is allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs who qualify for such support under the criteria outlined in various Department circulars.As the Deputy is aware, my Department implemented a general allocation system of learning support/resource teachers to mainstream primary schools in September 2005.  The system provides teaching resources to schools to enable them to cater for children with high-incidence special education needs.  The system allows schools to respond quickly and effectively to the individual needs of children with special educational needs.  The system facilitates flexibility in the delivery of interventions by schools in allowing for individualised tuition, group work, in-class support or a combination of these interventions, whichever is considered the most appropriate for the child in question.  It is a matter for the individual school to use its professional judgement to identify pupils that will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05, to schools to provide guidelines and advice on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.In circumstances where a child has low incidence needs, this automatically attracts an individual resource teaching allocation through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). Circular SP ED 02/05 advises school management that the additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools under the terms of the general allocation model cannot be used for mainstream class teaching or to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in mainstream classes.  Reference is also made in the circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools by the NCSE for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.In the case of post primary schools, circular PPT 01/05 outlines the Department's policy in relation to the allocation of teaching resources.  Group teaching approaches are prioritised in catering for pupils with special educational needs at post primary level.  Apart from the obvious benefit of being part of a group, this joint provision offers a level of support which meets and often exceeds the recommended individualised provision as per the relevant circulars.

A decision on the matter will be communicated to the relevant colleges as soon as possible.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1096	The Deputy is referring to funding arrangements for primary schools.  The way in which primary schools are funded takes account of the fact that the State's accounting period is based on a calendar year, while schools traditionally operate on the academic year commencing in September.  Thus, primary schools receive capitation funding in January and June, and the ancillary services grant in March.I have consistently said that it is my intention to streamline and rationalise the different grant schemes that provide funding to primary schools, both for ease of administration and to ensure that school management has greater autonomy over the funding provided.Therefore, capitation funding provided for general running costs, and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.  In due course, both grant schemes will be merged.  In the interim, both grants will continue to be paid according to existing timelines and calculated separately as heretofore.With regard to the availability of enrolment data, I wish to advise the Deputy that the primary census has up to now been a paper-based process; my Department would receive a set of paper forms from over 3200 primary and special schools every year.  Each form must be manually logged and checked and corrected with input from the school where necessary and then entered manually into my Department's database.  This process takes a number of months due to the number of schools involved.  For this reason, data for all schools at primary level does not normally become available until close to the end of the academic year.In order to reduce the processing time involved, a spreadsheet form has been introduced for the 2009/2010 census which can be returned to my Department by email.  This reduces the workload involved in processing the forms, as totals and checks are automatic, and the data can be loaded automatically to the database.It should be noted also that it has been the case in previous years that approximately 25-30% of returns for primary schools are still outstanding by the end of October deadline, which can add a further delay to the processing time for those schools that make a late return.

SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  My Department has no record of receiving a recommendation for a laptop for the child in question.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

These guidance documents state that at least one car-parking space near the main entrance should be provided for disabled users and the number of reserved spaces should be in accordance with the Building Regulations and the National Disability Authority guidelines.  Parking provision should be as stated in the guidance documents, subject to the planning requirements of the relevant Local Authority.In the case of older schools where the school authority is not in a position to provide the required amount of parking spaces for disabled users, application under the Emergency Works Scheme may be made to my Department for funding to provide same.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1099	The Deputy may be referring to advice which my Department sent to schools in Circular 47/09, sent to all primary and post-primary schools in August, which advised schools on how they could source information on and respond to the pandemic flu.My Department has been communicating public health advice from the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and Children to the education sector.  My officials are engaging with the management bodies of schools so that they can provide the most relevant information to schools that address any sector specific issues.  This public health information is guiding schools to update their plans to encourage and facilitate everyday actions that can help prevent the spread of this pandemic flu, and be able to respond to symptoms and cases of this flu.Specifically in relation to hand hygiene, the advice available to my Department is that students/staff should wash their hands with soap and water.  Hand-drying facilities must not be shared between people.  Therefore, the type of hand drying facilities that can be used include paper towels, which are disposed of into waste bins, hot air hand dryers, roller towels, or students and staff members could be asked to bring in and use their own individual towels.On the general issue of funding for schools, I wish to assure the Deputy that the education budget for 2009 provided for improvements to the overall level of day-to-day funding for primary schools, which has seen funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.This builds on the progress made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200, representing an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil, while the ancillary services grant for primary schools has increased by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil — or almost €25 extra — in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting €7,475 more.  In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day to day running costs.  Under these new rates, that primary school will receive €106,500.  This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants, which are paid by my Department.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €512 to €986 per pupil — an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.By any standards, these have been very significant improvements within a relatively short period of time, and the Government is committed to further increasing funding for schools as resources permit.  However, while increasing resources is important, we must also focus on measures to enhance the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to the best possible outcomes for our children.

It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.I wish to advise the Deputy that my officials have met representatives from the Secondary Education Committee to discuss future funding arrangements for Protestant schools.In this context, I have expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools that they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas.The October Budget implemented changes in how all fee-charging schools are treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated.  With effect from 1 January 2009, teachers in fee-charging schools are allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, which is a point higher than allocations in non-fee-charging post-primary schools.In view of the challenging economic circumstances that we are facing, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.This decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure.  Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.

The aims of this initiative include the development of communication skills in a modern European language, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in our schools. In the participating schools, the pupils in 5th and 6th classes are taught one of four languages — French, German, Italian and Spanish.  A dedicated support structure for the teachers in the schools concerned has been in place since the initiative was implemented.

However, the project scope was predicated on the assurance that certain site development works and appropriate site access from the main road were to be carried out by the developer such as access road/path as part of the overall deal with the school Patron.It has been brought to my attention that the developer has not, as yet, completed this work.  I understand that the Board of Management of the school is engaging with the developer to progress the terms of their agreement.  My officials are monitoring the situation.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Departments website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  Furthermore, my Department is now in the process of identifying school projects eligible for consideration for inclusion in the 4th bundle of Public Private Partnership projects and the school in question is being considered in that context.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

The Government wants to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole as well as the regions where they are based.I have asked the strategy group on higher education to report to me with a vision and roadmap for the development of Ireland's system of higher education for the next two decades.That group is now critically examining the roles and relationships of higher education institutions so that the system can deliver the levels of efficiency, performance, innovation and growth that will optimise Ireland's ‘smart' economic recovery and social development.There are no plans to advance any of the current applications for university status before the strategy group completes its work.

The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant holder's normal residence is 24 Km or less from the college which he/she is registered.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases, including all eligible mature students.The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the Local Authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.  A Schedule of Overall Accommodation has been agreed with the Board of Management to cater for a long term enrolment of 850 pupils.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

However, the Deputy should understand that children who are eligible for school transport at primary level and availing of a transport service, travel free.  Children who are eligible for transport at post-primary level and availing of a service, including students between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, are required to pay an annual charge, currently €300, unless the family is in possession of a valid medical card.  The level of fares applicable for travel on the LUAS is, therefore, not an issue for individual students availing of transport under the School Transport Scheme.

I recently announced my intention to establish a high level group on international education, which will initially focus on developing a national strategy for the promotion of international education.  This body through collaboration with relevant stakeholders will aim to achieve economies and efficiencies of scale in the marketing and delivery of education and services to international students. The development of a statutory quality mark, to be awarded by the amalgamated qualifications body, will be a key plank of this strategy.The quality mark regime will encompass wider dimensions of the individual's learning experience, including recruitment, orientation, accommodation, support services and fees issues.  The development of this quality mark will build on the Irish Higher Education Quality Network's recently published code of practice and guidelines for provision of education to international students.These guidelines outline agreed sector wide benchmarks in relation to recruitment, reception, education, pastoral care and welfare of international students and will provide institutions with a framework for setting their own education provision arrangements for international students.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1117	Media education is a specific strand unit within the social, personal and health education programme for all primary school pupils. By sixth class pupils develop an understanding of how information is conveyed, what may be deliberately excluded, the role of bias and the different messages promoted in advertising. The curriculum is designed to promote an increasingly critical and discerning attitude to advertising and media, their purposes and the messages they promote. This goes hand in hand with the strand unit on making decisions, so that children learn to examine critically the influences on their decision making and the consequences and processes involved.While media studies is not a specific subject at second level, the skills of interpretation and analysis, the use of language in different contexts and genres and the influences on decision making are covered within the existing curricula and allow scope for exploring issues related to the media. For example, in junior certificate English students are required to think, respond and communicate in everyday contexts, including a diary, a journal, a radio programme, video film, drama, poem, essay etc. Through exposure to a range of literary and media genres, they develop a critical consciousness with regard to all language use and learn to focus on the choice of words and the reasons for and effects of these particular choices of words. The skills acquired in junior cycle are built on in senior cycle English where the term "language" includes verbal and visual forms of communication, including the role of media, film and theatre. Engaging with fiction, drama, essay, poetry and film in an imaginative, responsive and critical manner forms part of the approach.These skills are also developed in history, through the critical examination of source documents. The emphasis is on the development of historical investigation skills and historical thinking, using evidence, and the need to look at history from different perspectives and as a dynamic process. The development of these critical and investigative skills can be transferred into many other areas of the curriculum and beyond.  The skills of information processing, analysis and critical evaluation are also developed through the action project within Civic, Social and Political Education, and through the specific module on influences and decisions within Social Personal and Health Education, both of which are mandatory subjects in junior cycle. This is designed to help students understand the role of the media and the impact of social mores in the wider community on their decisions.In the Transition Year Programme media studies is among the range of flexible options which can be taken by students. Overall, within our second level curricula, there is a key emphasis on the development of skills in research, data gathering, analysis, valuation and critical reflection which are important elements of effective learning.These skills are further strengthened through provision in the further and higher education sectors, where an extensive range of post leaving certificate courses and degree programmes are available in media production, journalism, animation, radio, TV and film, performing arts, graphic design, digital media, photography, computing and art and design.

This report sets out the various options available which looks at available models and draws on experience with other systems that operate internationally. The report is intended to allow for an informed examination of the issue — including existing international experience, the revenue impact of potential approaches, costs, affordability, value for money for the taxpayer, associated implementation issues and policy issues that arise in the Irish context.The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on various scenarios that might or might not emerge in advance of Government consideration of the report.

A site has been purchased for the provision of a new school building.My Department is now in the process of identifying what school projects are eligible for consideration for inclusion in the 4th bundle of PPP schools which I intend announcing as quickly as possible and the school in question is being considered in that context.The nature of procurement via Public Private Partnership is that a Bundle of school projects is offered to the market together. The other issues which have to be considered in the timing and bundling of schools include outline planning permission being secured, geographical spread and the total committed cost of the proposed bundle.The indicative timeframe for the delivery of a Bundle of Public Private Partnership schools currently stands at approximately 4 years for the date the Bundle is announced.

The position of the women who resided in the Magdalen laundries is one of the issues that has also been raised by groups representing survivors, following publication of the Ryan Report.The position in relation to the Magdalen laundries under the existing redress arrangements, is that section 1(3) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 provides that children who were sent to Magdalen laundries from institutions specified in the Schedule to the Act can be considered for financial redress if, as children, they were victims of abuse while resident in the laundries. This provision was included on the basis that the State was still responsible for the welfare and protection of children who were transferred to a Magdalen laundry from a State regulated institution.As the Deputies will be aware, the Magdalen laundries were privately owned and operated establishments which did not come within the responsibility of the State and were not subject to State regulation or supervision.  I would like to re-iterate my sincere apology for any offence caused by my inadvertent use of the term "employees" when referring to the women who worked in the laundries.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1122	I assume the Deputy is referring to the discontinuation of the Special Class for pupils with a Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) in the school in question.The Deputy will be aware that teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy and therefore the school no longer qualifies to retain the class concerned.The special class which has closed predates the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.All children with MGLD who were in the class that has been suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model. Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.The Deputy will be aware that my Department's policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system. In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

Examples are the  replacement of teachers taking career breaks from teaching or replacing teachers on secondment arrangements.  Temporary teachers may also be employed to fill short term vacancies pending the appointment of permanent replacements where teachers retire or resign from employment during the school year.Data extracted from my Department's payroll systems indicate that during the period 1st September 2008 to 23rd September 2009, 29 temporary appointments were made in County Longford and 55 in County Westmeath.

The total annual rental cost for all units is €824,215.  It is anticipated that there will be a saving of at least €14m in expenditure on rental of temporary accommodation in 2009, compared to 2008. This clearly demonstrates the efforts being made by my Department to reduce spending in this area.  The saving arises mainly from a reduction in the number of new rental contracts being entered into as a result of recent policy measures.  The downward trend in expenditure on rented accommodation is expected to continue into 2010 and onwards.

Clause 7.2 of the Higher Education Maintenance Grant Scheme States; "A Grant is tenable for the normal duration of the approved course and is  renewable annually subject to satisfactory attainment and the approval of the Local Authority, subject to the terms of Clause 7.6. Grants may not be paid in respect of a repeat year of study on the same course. A Local Authority shall have discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances, such as certified serious illness."Where funding in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level is awarded on the basis of exceptional circumstances, such as serious certified illness, it would be where the student himself/herself has suffered from a serious illness that has directly impacted on their ability to successfully complete the period concerned.Officials of my Department received an appeal from the candidate referred to by the Deputy and upheld the decision of Longford County Council.

The planning and Building Unit of my Department is working closely with the school authority to ensure that the transfer to this accommodation is as smooth as possible.With regard to the school's application for a new building, this, in common with all such applications, has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project in question, are now available on my Departments website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

While inspectors are generally recruited to work in either the primary or post-primary sector, the work of the Inspectorate is managed as a unified service headed by the Chief Inspector.  The Inspectorate is divided into two sub-divisions, each headed by a Deputy Chief Inspector. The Regional Subdivision is responsible for the delivery and management of section/evaluation services and related advisory activities in schools and centres for education. The Policy Support Subdivision is responsible for contributing to the development of Departmental policy across a range of areas, for supporting inspection/evaluation activity generally, and for operational services for the Inspectorate. Inspectors from the Policy Support Subdivision also contribute to the work of the Regional Subdivision by conducting inspection activity throughout the year.The staffing of each subdivision is listed below.Regional Subdivision1 Deputy Chief Inspector5 Assistant Chief Inspectors18 Divisional Primary Inspectors32 Primary Inspectors17 Senior Post-Primary Inspectors28.5 Post-Primary InspectorsPolicy Support Subdivision1 Deputy Chief Inspector4 Assistant Chief inspectors12 Divisional Primary Inspectors1 Primary Inspector10 Senior Post-Primary Inspectors2.5 Post-Primary InspectorsOne Assistant Chief Inspector and nine Divisional/Senior Inspectors are also assigned to the Directorate of Regional Services.

I have also indicated that the commencement of the section will provide for it to be regulated that a school may employ unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in exceptional circumstances.I believe that the above proposed legislative arrangement reflects the situation facing schools today where it is not always possible, for a variety of reasons, to engage a registered teacher for substitution duty.I intend that this proposed amendment will be facilitated under the Education (Patronage) Bill which is due to be published during the Autumn term of the Oireachtas.

Of that number, 2,324 have successfully completed the required professional element and my Department is currently in the process of checking that the  service requirement has been fulfilled. 58 teachers deferred their probation for reasons such as maternity leave, sick leave or change of employment.Schools were  advised in June of the arrangements for probation in the current school year.  A series of dates were nominated for submission of applications. The closing date for Round 1 applications was 30th June 2009.  Round 2 closed on 11th September.  Applications for Round 3 are to be submitted by 23rd October, and 21st December for Round 4.  To date, 1,359 applications have been accepted for 2009/2010, from the first two rounds.The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of years service of each teacher who completed the probationary process during the 2008/2009 academic year would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile as it is not readily available within my Department.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1132	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1152 and 1161 to 1163, inclusive, together.My Department is progressing work to improve systems within the Department to facilitate access to accurate and up-to-date information both to ensure more efficient use of official time and to reduce the administrative burden on schools.  My Department began the process of rationalising internal databases a number of years ago. The Department's unified data model (UDM) is based on 3 core entities, namely Educational Organisation, Pupil and Staff Member.  The Educational Organisation aspect of the model was implemented in February, 2007.  Essentially, the implementation facilitates the recording and maintenance of school details, such as address, in a central location.  Work is under way on the development of the post primary element of the pupil entity and, subject to adequate resources, is scheduled to go live in October 2010.My Department continues to seek to reduce the administrative overhead for schools through the use of information technology most notably in providing on-line facilities to streamline the collection of data and reduce the number of manual tasks. The esinet portal through which these on-line services are delivered already provides an On-Line Claims System (OLCS) which allows each primary school and Voluntary Secondary, Community and Comprehensive school record absences and submit claims to the Department for the payment of casual and non casual teachers and Special Needs Assistants. This system has significantly reduced the process of manual form filling at school level and manual data input at Department level.In 2008 a Returns service was provided via esinet to enable post primary schools upload pupil and timetable data. Statistics section has dispensed with paper forms for the Annual Census of Primary Schools this year and has instead provided a form in spreadsheet version which schools can email back to the Department. This new system allows for more efficient completion of the census form by the school, as certain parts of the data such as totals for each category of pupil can be automatically calculated and cross checked. It will also allow for quicker provision of data to other areas of the Department for allocations purposes, thus negating the requirement for these areas to send a duplicate request to the schools.Later this year a facility will be available to all schools, again via esinet to electronically transmit details of their school building stock to enable the Department compile an Inventory of School Accommodation.  Other developments include the introduction of Geographic Information technology which has greatly improved the capacity of the Department to identify the location and quantity of new school accommodation needed to cater for population increases.The development of a database for individual pupils at primary level remains an important goal for my Department, however it has not been possible to progress it as yet.   Like any organisation, the level of progress will depend on available financial, human and IT resources and how they will need to be deployed given emerging priorities and wider public finance constraints.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1133	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1153 and 1154 together.The inventory to which the Deputy refers was a pilot project carried out in schools in County Kildare. It was intended that the results of this pilot project would be used by the Department to determine the merits, or otherwise, of expanding the inventory on a nationwide basis.The project commenced in 2001 and was completed in 2002.  Having evaluated the pilot project results, it was decided not to proceed with its expansion in view of the high costs associated this at a time when there were more pressing priorities in terms of the available finance.  It is important to point out that one of the findings of the pilot exercise showed that the data gathered in relation to the condition of the school buildings has relevance for a relatively short number of years.  However, the information in the database was utilised and accessed within the Planning and Building Unit for so long as it was useful and relevant. In this regard it was last accessed two years ago.  The floor layout plans and other drawing data gathered during the course of the pilot inventory is still largely relevant and can be used by the Department's Technical staff as appropriate.My Department's licence for parts of the inventory software has lapsed and it does not intend renewing this given, as I have already said, that the information gathered in relation to the condition of the school buildings has limited relevance.I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level which will establish the position relating to the extent of all accommodation. The specifications for this inventory are being finalised with a view to commencing the work at an early date.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1134	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1155 and 1156 together.I will arrange to forward the information requested by the Deputy shortly.  It is anticipated that there will be a saving of at least €14m in expenditure on rental of temporary accommodation in 2009, compared to 2008. This clearly demonstrates the efforts being made by my Department to reduce spending in this area.  The saving arises mainly from a reduction in the number of new rental contracts being entered into.  The downward trend in expenditure on rented accommodation is expected to continue into 2010 and onwards.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1135	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1157 and 1158 together.Details of the schools approved for a devolved capital grant to provide temporary accommodation (with the option to provide permanent accommodation instead for the same funding) are given in the following tabular statement. The list of approvals covers the period 2008 and 2009 to-date and indicate the options being pursued by the schools. It is a matter for school authorities to decide which option best suits their needs. The Deputy will note that a number of schools have not yet indicated to my Department which option they intend to pursue.The funding is provided on a devolved basis which empowers school authorities to manage these works with guidance from my Department. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money. 70% of approved funding may be drawn down when a project goes to construction and the balance when a project is completed, subject to the necessary certification being supplied to my Department.  My Department does not collect information from the schools regarding supplier details for units which have been purchased.CountyRoll NoSchoolClassroomsPermanent Build or Pre-fabCarlow01415KScoil Phadraig, Rathoe1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCarlow04077ISt. Brigid’s NS, Tullow1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCarlow13507IScoil Mhuire Lourdes, Tullow1 × 80m2 ASD UnitCarlow13607MSt Columba’s NS, Tullow1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCarlow17501QScoil Binn an Choire1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCarlow18424GSt. Joseph’s NS,1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCavan08453HCrubany NS1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCavan08490NSt. Clare’s School, Ardmhuire3 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomspermanentCavan14073GSt Patricks NS, Castletara1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCavan14399NKilgarry NS2 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomsprefabCavan16083TSt Mary’s NS1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCavan16316QSt. Mary’s NS, Arva2 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomspermanentCavan18059JSt. Anne’s NS, Bailieborough1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCavan19363RMullahoran NS, Kilcogy1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCavan19608VSt. Kilian’s NS, Mullagh1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabCavan20172RSt. Joseph’s NS, Kingscourt1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabClare04548VScoil Seanain Naofa, Clonlara1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabClare14757NScoil na Mainistreach, Quin1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabClare15042AEnnis N.S1 × classroom (relocated from Kilraine NS, Wexford)prefabClare16908SSixmile Bridge NS2 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomsprefabClare16946DParteen NS1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabClare17517IDoolin Mixed NS1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentClare17801FScoil na Maighdine Muire,  Broadford1 × 80 m2 Mainstream  & 1 × 25 m2 ResourceprefabClare18032MClonmoney NS, Ennis1 × 50m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabClare18555VLissycasey NS, Ennis1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomClare19233ESt. Clare’sRefurb for 2 special needs roomsClare19274SSt Conaires SchoolRelocation of 1 × 80m2 ClassroomClare19414ISt. Anne’s NS, Ennis1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomClare19442NRuan Central National School1x80m2 classroompermanentClare19698CSt. Aidan’s NS, Shannon1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomprefabClare19838PGaelscoil Mhicil Ciosog1 × 80 m2 Mainstream  & 2 × 25m2 ResourcePermanentClare20075TSt. Mochulla’s NS, Ennis Rd.,Tulla1 × 80 m2 Mainstream  & 1 × 25 m2 ResourceprefabCork01867WCastlelyons NS1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCork02278IPresentation NS, Millstreet2 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomspermanentCork04152TScoil Mhaoiliosa, Knockavilla, Upton1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCork08972ICastlelack NS1 × 80 m2 Mainstream  & 1 × 25 m2 ResourcePermanentCork09537SBallinadee NS1 × 80m2 mainstream classroompermanentCork11249CBurnfort NS, Mallow1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroompermanentCork12004AMallow No. 1 School1 × 80m2 ClassroomCork12015FLiscarroll NS1 × 80m2 Mainstream ClassroomCork12395SRusheen NS1 × 100m2 UnitCork12447LBaltydaniel NS1 × 80m2 mainstream classroom for Autistic UnitpermanentCork12456MSt. Molaga’s NS1 × 80m2 classroomCork13450FRushbrooke NS2 × 80m2 mainstream classroomsprefabCork13543MDerrinacahara1 × 80m2

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1137	The first phase of a new post-primary school building with accommodation for up to 350 pupils has been completed and is in operation. The building's flexible design allowed for the opportunity to provide sufficient accommodation for a new start-up primary school as part of the first phase. This accommodation is available for use as a new primary school in 2010 if the demand is there. The design allows for the accommodation to revert for post-primary use in the future, as required.With regard to the remaining seven primary schools I can confirm the following: four schools have been completed and handed over to the relevant school authorities; one school has been partially handed over with the remaining accommodation to be handed over at the end of the month; one school is due to be handed over in the next week and the final school is currently out to tender and is expected to be on site in the fourth quarter of 2009.  I understand that the delay in the provision of the latter school was due to planning issues arising.Details of the schools are provided in the following table.CountyRoll No.SchoolAccommodationStatusPrimaryCork00512DMidleton Convent NS16 classroom schoolCompleteCork20335TScoil Phadraig Naofa, Rochestown8 classroom schoolCompleteDublin City20131DDublin 7 Educate Together, Grangegorman16 classroom school + Special Needs FacilitiesCompleteKildare20192AScoil Atha Í, Athy8 classroom schoolComplete in OctoberKildare20271TScoil na Naomh Uilig, Rickardstown, Newbridge16 classroom school — due to go on site end of 2009At tender stageLouth20146QLe Cheile ET, Mornington, Drogheda16 classroom school + General Purpose RoomCompleteWexford20214HGorey ET8 classroom extension + General Purpose Room + Special Needs FacilitiesPartially handed over with the remaining accommodation to be handed over end OctoberPost-primaryFingal76129HArdgillan Community College, BalbrigganNew post-primary school providing 350 places plus provision for primary use.Complete
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1138	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1164 to 1182, inclusive, together.Information on the current school building programme and on applications on hand for major capital works is available on my Department's web-site at www.education.ie. The following tabular statements (Table 1 and Table 2 respectively) provides the additional information requested by the Deputy.Every application for major capital works is initially given a provisional priority band rating. A definitive band rating is assigned to a project when it is being considered for commencement of architectural planning.With regard to projects banded as 1.3, indicating that a building is structurally unsound, I can inform the Deputy that there are currently two projects with such a band rating which are at an advanced stage of architectural planning. There are a further two schools at application stage which are listed as being provisionally in band 1 on my Departments web-site by virtue of being described in their applications as structurally unsound. The names and addresses of these schools are included in the following tabular statement. In relation to schools which may have buildings which are structurally unsound, it is open to those schools to apply to the Planning and Building Unit of my Department for emergency works funding for capital works of an urgent nature. Grants from this fund are available for very urgent works, primarily of a major health and safety nature, to schools that require them.  Two of the schools concerned have availed of funding in this manner to address immediate issues relating to their buildings.Applications are received by my Department on an ongoing basis and as part of the initial assessment process are assigned a provisional band rating. The attached tabular statement (Table 3) contains details of a small number of applications which have been received this year and for which the assessments have not yet been completed.CountyRoll No.SchoolCurrent StatusBand RatingCarlow70420RCarlow Vocational SchoolIn early Architectural Planning1.1Clare15042AEnnis National School, Ennis, Co ClareCommencing Architectural Planning1.1Cork16746SBallygarvan NS , Ballygarvan, Co CorkCommencing Architectural Planning1.1Cork18279ASt Mary’s Church of Ireland NS (formerly Carrigaline N.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1139	As the Deputy will be aware, the construction industry has experienced a change in trading conditions in the last year.  This has resulted in certain changes for the operation and management of large public tender competitions and the management of projects for my Department.The reduction in demand generally in the construction industry has resulted in  welcome reductions in prices being quoted in tenders for large scale projects.   In addition, the number of contractors seeking to pre-qualify for inclusion in  tender lists has increased.The larger number of applications being received requires a greater amount of  time and resources to be allocated to the assessment of such pre-qualification  submissions.In addition, the more difficult trading conditions mean that the Department has  to be aware of the risk of successful tenderers not being able to secure the  necessary bonds etc. required before the contract can be awarded.My Department is also aware of an increased risk of contractor insolvency  arising mid-contract due to constrained credit availability and generally  difficult trading conditions.The introduction of the new public works contracts and associated documentation  has, as anticipated by my Department, proved to be a major change for the  public sector construction industry.  Consultancy firms, already affected by  large scale redundancies, have taken time to adjust to the implications of the  changes, notwithstanding the efforts of my Department to ease the transition,  through briefing sessions and guidance documentation.Contractors, in order to secure projects in the current market conditions,  appear to be taking an extremely competitive approach to the risk elements  transferred to the contractor under the new form of contract.  External design  consultants will have the increased challenge of ensuring that building quality  is maintained, notwithstanding this competitive approach.

My Department has made enquiries with Marino Institute of Education and the number of primary teachers who trained in another jurisdiction and who undertook all or part of the Scrudú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge (SCG) during the 2008/2009 academic year was 589. The SCG consists of 4 modules and candidates may take different modules in different years. The number who passed the SCG in this period was 413.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1144	In accordance with the terms of Directive 2005/36/EC the Teaching Council is the designated authority in Ireland for assessing applications for registration from persons recognised as teachers in other EU/EEA countries.Where shortfalls are identified in the courses of study undertaken leading to the academic and professional qualifications held by such applicants, the applicant must be given the choice of addressing theses shortfalls by means of an aptitude test or by way of an adaptation period.In relation to the primary sector, while shortfalls may arise in a variety of fields, such as curricular areas, the foundation disciplines, or age range, the most common shortfall to be addressed is in relation to the Irish language requirement.I have made inquiries with the Teaching Council and from the 28th March 2006 to date, the number of primary teachers who trained in another jurisdiction who have indicated the Adaptation option as their preferred method of meeting the Irish Language requirement is 315.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1145	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The changes made in relation to book grants were one aspect of these measures.The key change is that aid for school books is being restricted to schools that have been included within the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) scheme.  By limiting the funding to schools within the DEIS scheme, savings of €7.5m will be achieved.As the Deputy will be aware, DEIS is the action plan for educational inclusion and focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools at primary and post-primary level for the school book grant scheme; the same level of provision has been made available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.  At primary level, 673 schools will receive enhanced funding, while at second level, 203 schools will benefit.The continuation of this provision to these schools is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and protect the most vulnerable in our society.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need.  This is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2006 report on primary disadvantage.My Department has encouraged schools to implement book rental schemes as a measure to minimise the cost of school books to all parents.  As far back as 1993, a report commissioned by my Department dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  The report included useful suggestions for schools, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes.  I know that many schools have developed such rental schemes.It is open to schools to utilise general capitation funding to fund book rental schemes.My Department has issued a circular to schools and vocational education committees, outlining that funding provided to meet day-to-day running costs can be used to provide school books where this is a priority for the school or the VEC.  My Department has sought to ensure that schools are fully aware that using any funds provided by my Department for such purposes is not only legitimate but desirable.Planned expenditure levels for my Department will be considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010, and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.

In these circumstances, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision.  Where the school is established or maintained by a VEC an appeal shall lie in the first instance to the VEC and thereafter to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol or re-instate a pupil.The information requested by the Deputy is included in the attached table, which details the total number of appeals admitted by the Department for each of the last five full years, the total which proceeded to full Section 29 hearing, and the outcome of these appeals.

Designs have been prepared and planning permission lodged for the project.  The progression of the project is contingent on the receipt of the necessary statutory approvals and the acquisition of two strips of land by the Patron.It is not possible at this juncture to give an indication as to when this project will commence construction pending the satisfactory resolution of these issues.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1153	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1199 and 1200 together.As the Deputy will be aware the employment relationship for teachers in Ireland is with individual school authorities rather than with my Department.While that is the case the actual contract offered by schools and duties required of a teacher must take account of, inter alia, employment legislation, the rules applying in the sector and the outcome of determinations and agreements reached in an industrial relations context over time.As a general statement it is fair to say that teaching/class contact time is the dominant feature in the contractual arrangements for teachers in Ireland in contrast to the arrangements in some other jurisdictions.  This has meant that many of the duties referred to by the Deputy are not comprehended within the contractual arrangements except where changes have been secured through the  modernisation element of recent national agreements.  For example changes in relation to parent teacher meetings and staff meetings were secured under Sustaining Progress.  Additional payments for substitution and supervision were agreed in 2002 to cover a range of duties in those categories.It is also worth noting that many teachers engage voluntarily in school activities over and above what is required in contractual terms and in doing so add to the holistic development of their pupils.My Department's submission to the last benchmarking exercise identified in broad terms the differences in the contractual arrangements for teachers in Ireland compared to other jurisdictions and this material was also provided to the Special Group on Expenditure.  I will arrange to have the Deputy provided with a copy of this material.I can also arrange to have Department officials brief the Deputy on the detail of the different contractual arrangements or provide copies of particular relevant circulars if he so wishes.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1157	Under the terms of my Department's post primary school transport scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.A service may be established where a sufficient number of eligible pupils, within an area, apply for transport to the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live.In a case where there are not enough eligible pupils residing in an area to warrant the establishment of a service, a transport grant may be paid by the Department to the parent/guardian of the eligible pupils concerned.The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for and no additional state cost is incurred.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.In general, catchment boundary tickets are issued on a first come, first served basis.The transport liaison officer for Waterford has advised that the pupils in question reside in the Tramore catchment area and therefore may only apply for catchment boundary school transport to Waterford City post-primary centre subject to terms of the scheme.  As the present services are operating to capacity, it would not be appropriate to provide additional seats to accommodate catchment boundary pupils.

A section 29 appeal recently took place in respect of a refusal to enrol this child to a school in Leixlip. This appeal was not upheld.  Only where an appeal under section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been unable to secure a placement to date.  I understand that in this instance that the NEWB are actively assisting the family in pursuing applications to other schools.Home Tuition support may also be provided, on application, as a temporary interim measure, for pupils who do not have a school placement or are unable to secure a school place.

Pupils living off the main route of a service are expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the primary school transport scheme.Bus Éireann, which is responsible for the operation of the school transport scheme, on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupils referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, reside 1.05 kilometres from the existing pick up point.Bus Éireann has also advised that the pick up point is considered to be as safe as other pick-up points being used by pupils travelling under the school transport scheme throughout the country.

This study has been conducted using  data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. This information has been circulated to all existing school patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of  existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as patron for any new primary school, should it be required. The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.The forward planning section is in the process of carrying out an analysis of each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014/2015.When the required reports have been completed for these initial areas selected the forward planning section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.As a matter of course, there is ongoing close liaison between my Department and local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any proposed major housing developments and their possible implications for school provision.

This was received in June and reviewed by the Department's Technical staff and further detailed comments issued in September. The Design Team have been requested to consider and respond to each of the comments listed.Following receipt and approval of the Design Team's response my Department will revert to the school regarding the next steps in the progression of the project towards stage 2(b) of architectural planning.

VTOS participants are entitled to a training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate.  VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits and are eligible for meal and travel allowances.  In addition, a training bonus is paid to participants who have been in receipt of their social welfare payment for at least 12 months (312 days) directly before their course commencement date.I understand from the relevant VEC that the person referred to by the Deputy did not have the required amount of days in receipt of their social welfare payment before their course commencement date to qualify for receipt of the training bonus.

However it does not contain information on the number of Special Needs Assistants or other school staff in each school.If the Deputy has an enquiry about a particular school my officials will be happy to provide the information directly to her.The Primary Census for the 2009/2010 school year will be carried out in the Autumn and the final outcome will be made available when this process is completed.The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional information on the Department's website about teacher allocations for 2009/10 school year. This was done as a first step at improving the level of information in the public domain about changes to the staffing allocations at both primary and post-primary level. The allocation process will not reach finality until later this year and I remain committed to publishing updated information.

At the last meeting the chairperson of the school reported that the board had appointed a fully qualified teacher to serve as principal of the school. The local inspector has visited the school since the commencement of the new school year and has provided advice and support for the principal.I can assure the Deputy that my officials will continue to engage closely with the patron and the Board and that the quality of the school's work will be monitored through further inspection visits during the coming school year.The Patron of this school has indicated to the Department that he wishes the school to continue while fully acknowledging that the difficulties at the school have to be resolved. My Department's focus at this time is to support the school in bringing about the required improvements.

Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the projects in question, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.
The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including these projects, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the projects at this time.

Part of that review is the development of standardised designs and specifications and associated documentation for the procurement of temporary accommodation.  In progressing this element of the review, the firm of specialists engaged to assist with this review has engaged with a number of firms who specialise in the provision of modular accommodation that is capable of being constructed off-site and delivered and erected on school sites within a short time-frame.  Issues such as cost, quality, durability, maintenance and demountability will be examined and assessed and decisions will be made based on this assessment.The firm of specialists are working in close co-operation with my Department on all elements of the review.  My officials hold regular meetings with the firm to review and discuss developments.   Recommendations arising from the work being undertaken will be implemented as soon as practicable with a view to achieving better value for money and improved quality of school accommodation.Furthermore, in preparing the brief for new school building projects that are approved to proceed to architectural planning, consideration is now being given by my Department to the provision of additional accommodation through the use of modular designs where the schedule of accommodation, site constraints, extent of intervention in existing buildings, planning/statutory approval issues, timescale for delivery etc. are favourable to that approach.Elements of modular design were incorporated in the rapid delivery programmes for developing areas that were delivered for the 08/09 and 09/10 school years.I am satisfied that these programmes were successful and effective in terms of quality of accommodation provided and speed of delivery.

At the level of individual schools, the budget changes in relation to the allocation of teaching posts will impact in different ways, depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.Provisional information on teacher allocations to second level schools, whether enrolment related or otherwise, was published on my Department's website. The information represents the position at the time of publication and is not the final position. At this point the allocations process for special needs, language support etc. is still underway. The information on the Department's website will be further updated later in the year when the allocation process is fully completed. At that stage a comparison can be made between the level of resources allocated to schools this year compared to last year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1177	Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) forms a mandatory part of curriculum provision in primary schools and in junior cycle. The overall aim is to help develop students' confidence and self esteem, and promote the skills for living, for responsible decision making, and for mental, physical and emotional health and wellbeing.The implementation of these programmes in schools is supported by support services at primary and second level which provide professional development for teachers and advice and support to schools. At second level, a full time  support service is operated jointly with the Health Sector. A range of resources and manuals are available to support teachers in implementing the programme. While evaluations of the second level programme have indicated many positive features and have viewed the training provided by the support services as of high quality, the lack of a pre-service qualification for teachers in this area, allied with continued changes of staff deployed within schools to teach SPHE, may dilute the impact of inservice training. My Department is examining how this issue can best be addressed in the context of overall priorities and resources across the system.

Teachers who were members of the main pension scheme at any time between 31 March 2004 and 31 August 2005 were given the option of joining the revised scheme or of retaining their present status, either as members of the Original Spouses' and Children's Scheme or remaining outside such schemes.The person to whom the Deputy refers was provided with details of the revised scheme and a personalised option form.  She returned the option form within the option period in which she opted for membership of the revised scheme.  In signing the option form the person confirmed that she had read the circular and was opting for the revised scheme.  Accordingly, she exercised a valid option to join the revised Spouses' and Children's Pension Scheme for Secondary Teachers and it is not possible to revoke it.

My Department will be in contact with the school authorities when the SENO's report has been received.  Thereafter, the progression of any project for the school will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project at this time.

The languages available as part of the post primary curriculum in schools include French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic. The post primary language initiative provides supports to encourage a diversification of language provision in schools and to encourage the take up of languages other than French.It is important that students experience a broad and balanced education which prepares them for economic and social participation, for democratic citizenship and lifelong learning. Of necessity this requires that students have to juggle priorities in making decisions on subject choice. Curricular choice is important in ensuring that young people are offered a balanced range of subjects in keeping with their interests and abilities, and that they are motivated to achieve success in learning and remain in school to completion of upper second level education.The study shows that English is the most widely studied language in upper second level education across the EU other than their mother tongue.  The fact that all Irish people speak English, often referred to as the new lingua franca, can be a disincentive to the learning of other languages, just as in other European Member States it is often difficult to promote the learning of languages other than English.

Schools also benefited from an equipment grant, amounting to €5,079 for each school offering the programme.As a result of the need to make savings in Budget 2009, this grant was abolished with effect from 1 January 2009. The budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect, the education sector, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.While certain grants were abolished, such as that available for the Leaving Certificate Applied, I would like to emphasise that the capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%, representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from January 2009. Voluntary secondary schools also received an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil from January 2009. This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 pupils will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009. A more favourable teacher allocation ratio applies to the Leaving Certificate Applied programme.Planned expenditure levels for my Department will be considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010, and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.

Third level institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in any case where the free fees schemes do not apply.  The issue of a refund of tuition fees is also a matter for each institution and I have no role in this matter.

It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether this concession should be applied in the case of its school. If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day, their parents should be notified accordingly and invited to collect them at time of dismissal.It is acknowledged that particular circumstances may arise whereby the implementation of the shorter day for pupils in infant classes may cause issues for some parents. Where this arises, my Department would encourage school authorities to engage with parents locally with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution.As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1192	The residency clause of the scheme requires, in the case of a candidate under 23, that the candidate's parents or guardians to have been resident in the administrative area of a Local Authority from 1st October of the previous year.  In the case of an independent mature candidate the candidate himself/herself must have been resident in the administrative area of a Local Authority from 1st October of the previous year. The Local Authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances. I would, however, point out that the type of situation where residency is waived is, for example, where an independent mature candidate him/herself has missed the residency requirement by a relatively short period of time. In cases where a candidate returns to the State following a period abroad and where the awarding body decides, at its discretion, to waive the residency requirement the candidate may be assessed for the grant without meeting the prescribed residency requirement from 1st October of the previous year.One of the main considerations in this type of case is the period of time a candidate has resided outside of the State. The Department suggests that in such cases, the residency requirement may be waived at the discretion of the awarding body only where the period of time abroad does not exceed one year.On this basis, and on condition that the students submits satisfactory evidence of independent residence prior to going abroad and for the period after their return, the Department has no objection to a candidate being assessed as an independent mature candidate for the purpose of the grant application.In cases where a candidate has been out of the country for a period of time of more than one year before commencing his/her course, irrespective of whether or not he/she can produce evidence of independent living prior to going abroad, he/she would not be eligible to be considered under the residency clause of the scheme.In publishing the student grant schemes for 2009/10 earlier this year, I gave notice that it is intended to introduce a revised residency requirement of three out of the last five years with effect from 2010/11, in line with the provisions in the Student Support Bill. This will allow for greater flexibility in meeting the residency requirement.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1193	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1252, 1253 and 1268 together.There are a number of circumstances in which it is possible for teachers and other education sector staff to retire on pension before preserved pension age.  This is 60 years of age or, in the case of new entrants appointed on or after 1 April 2004 for the first time or following at least a 6 month break in service, 65 years of age.Firstly, under the 55/35 year rule a teacher, other than a new entrant, who has reached the age of 55 years and has at least 35 years of actual pensionable service, may retire voluntarily.  There is no actuarial reduction in benefits and credit for certain pre-service training is given in order to assist teachers to reach the 35-year threshold for retirement.Secondly, under cost-neutral early retirement, a public servant aged 50 years or over (55 years in the case of new entrants) has the option of an immediate cost-neutral early retirement pension and lump sum on resignation.  The cost-neutral early retirement benefits are actuarially reduced to take account of the early payment of the lump sum and the longer period over which pension would be paid.Thirdly, a public servant with more than 5 years pensionable service may be awarded a disability pension which may include the award of added years.  A person with less than 5 years service who has to retire on medical grounds has the option of taking a once-off lump sum payment.Finally, under the pilot Early Retirement Scheme for Teachers, a pension could be granted 3 strands.  Strand 1 related to teachers who were consistently experiencing professional difficulties in their teaching duties and an award of up to 5 added years was permitted.  Strand 2 related to teachers whose retirement would provide their school with an opportunity to enhance the education service provided through facilitating change and up to 2 added years could be awarded.  Strand 3 related to permanent teachers who were in posts which were surplus to requirements, from which they could not be redeployed readily and which would not be filled should they leave the posts.  Up to 7 added years could be awarded.  The Government decided to suspend the pilot early retirement scheme for teachers in all sectors until further notice as part of the Budget and Estimates decision for 2009.Details of the numbers of teachers who retired under each of these headings in the years 2006 to 2008 and up to 31 August 2009 is set out in a table.  The figures for post-primary teachers do not include VEC teachers where the retirements and pension benefit awards are made by the relevant VEC.  Other than the award of added years for ill-health and the, now suspended, Early Retirement Scheme, there are no discretionary payments made to teachers.A teacher who resigns or whose contract is terminated and who has at least two years pensionable service may apply for a pension and lump sum from age 60 (age 65 in the case of new entrants) based on actual service.  Each year the Department pays a number of preserved pensions under this category.Details of the number of Department staff who have taken early retirement and those whose contracts have terminated in the years 2006 to 2009 are included in a separate table. The Department has not sanctioned or applied a pension top- up or discretionary payment on retirement to a staff member of the Department in this period.My Department does not record the full actuarial costs related to pensions granted by it.My Department will seek to obtain information in relation to early retirement, resignation and termination of staff contracts, and discretionary payments for staff employed by agencies under its aegis.Retirement Category2006200720082009 as at 31 August 2009Voluntary Age 60 but under Age 6558104Ill-health4284Cost-Neutral Early Retirement3342Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement———2Resignations, End of Contracts, Dismissals2006200720082009 as at 31 August 2009Resigned91397End of Contract2———Dismissal22——Retirement Category2006200720082009 as at 31 August 2009Voluntary Age 55 but under Age 60202196230447Disability59433519Cost-Neutral Early Retirement22152221Early Retirement Strand 1274233—Early Retirement Strand 2121313—Early Retirement Strand 31151—Retirement Category2006200720082009 as at 31 August 2009Voluntary  Age 55 but under Age 6089129138274Disability43503834Cost-Neutral Early Retirement14181225Early Retirement Strand 1454854—Early Retirement Strand 2373730—Early Retirement Strand 3528331—

The Government provided an endowment of IR£2million for the programme in 1999.In 2007, a decision was taken to secure the long term viability of this programme by increasing Ireland's contribution to the Fund for the programme by €20 million to be paid over a number of years conditional on matching funding being raised by the US-Ireland Alliance.Following Government approval of the general scheme of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund (Amendment) Bill 2009, I sent the Bill to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting. The Bill is scheduled to be published in the current session.While a financial provision was included in my Department's Estimates for 2007 and 2008 in respect of the Fund for the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme, no payments have been made to date in that regard pending the finalisation of the necessary amending legislation to the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act, 1998.

In order to prepare for tender and to comply with the new form of Government contract, the project was required to submit a new Stage 2b (detailed design).Following the receipt and clearance of the Stage 2b (detailed design) submission, the project was authorised to go tender in June and a tender report was received by the Department in late August. The Department wrote to the school in early September with its comments on the Tender Report and requested that a revised Tender Report be submitted.This revised Tender Report has been received, and is currently being assessed.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1208	As the Deputy is aware the board of management of each school is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  My Department further requires each school to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  My Department has also been working with the Gay Lesbian and Equality Network (GLEN) on the development of guidance material for school leaders in supporting lesbian, gay and bisexual students in second-level school.  "Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Students in Post-Primary Schools: Guidance for Principals and School Leaders" produced in association with the education partners and published jointly by GLEN and my Department, will be launched next week [by Minister of State Sean Haughey TD] and circulated to schools.As part of a whole-school evaluation each school's code of behaviour is requested and reviewed by the inspection team, along with other key school policy documents.  The extent to which the policy is in line with the Department's published Guidelines on Countering Bullying is considered.  If a school does not have a legally required policy, inspectors will recommend that the school's management address this as a matter of priority.  In addition, where policies are found not to be in line with Department guidelines a policy review is recommended.  This advice is given orally to the staff of the school and the board of management, as appropriate, and included in the published report of the inspection.The review of anti-bullying policy during a WSE does not focus explicitly on any single category of bullying or harassment such as homophobic bullying.  The WSE reports published by my Department in 2008, and 2009 to date, have not explicitly identified problems with homophobic bullying, nor have school policies and practices to deal with such behaviour in individual schools been identified by inspectors as causes for concern.  The reports for the period, therefore, do not make specific recommendations to schools regarding improving approaches to tackling homophobic bullying.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for and no additional state cost is incurred.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.  In general, catchment boundary tickets are issued on a first come, first served basis.The pupils referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied, are not attending the school in the catchment area in which they reside, may only avail of concessionary transport from the catchment boundary and under the terms of the school transport scheme they must make their own way to that boundary.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department, except in exceptional circumstances.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

The main source of funding for personal assistants is the Fund for Students with Disabilities.  Colleges of further and higher education can apply to the Fund on behalf of students who require a personal assistant in order to participate equitably in their education.The manner in which the personal assistants are employed is a matter for each institution.  The terms and conditions of employment for employees who provide support for students with disabilities in third level is a matter for the individual colleges concerned.Some €174,000 was made available to Carlow Institute of Technology under the Fund for Students with Disabilities in the 2008/09 academic year.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.Planned expenditure levels for my Department will be considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  This will include consideration of the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.

Such an arrangement would, in time, require the GAA club to surrender its interest in some of the lands required for the building project.  My Department has written to the GAA club summarising the views of the local authority on a proposed design solution while outlining the Departments position on same.  A response is awaited from the GAA club.

The forum is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance, and also comprises of the relevant School Management Bodies, and the relevant Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU).As a first step, the forum decided to establish the factual position regarding the terms and conditions of employment of school secretaries and caretakers by conducting a comprehensive survey of schools.  This survey was then developed by my Department, in consultation with the other members of the forum.  As there are established terms and conditions for secretaries and caretakers employed in the Community & Comprehensive sector and the VEC sector, it was decided that the survey should only cover the primary and voluntary post-primary sectors.This survey was then issued to all relevant schools on Monday, 20 April 2009.  The results of the survey, once available, will inform the deliberations of the forum.As the discussions of the forum are currently in progress it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.

The report sets out a strategy to meet the future capital needs of the higher education sector.  The information supplied was taken from Section 6 of the Report, which examines current building stock and was updated as appropriate to allow for the time lapse since its publication.I will arrange for a copy of the report to be forwarded to the Deputy.
