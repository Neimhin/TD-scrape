#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.The OECD review of the Irish public service published in April 2008 benchmarked the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and made recommendations as to the further direction of public service reform.It confirmed the many strengths of the system and identified the challenges that needed to be addressed.Following the launch of that report, a task force was appointed to develop an action plan building on the analysis and recommendations of the review.  It completed its work in November 2008 with the publication of its report Transforming Public Services, which I launched in tandem with an accompanying Government statement.  The transforming public services programme represents the blueprint for a new type of unified public service focused on common goals, with greater co-operation and reduced boundaries between sectors, organisations and professions, with a much greater integration of services around user needs and far greater efficiency in internal data sharing and administration through shared service models.Implementation of the transformation programme is overseen by the Cabinet committee on transforming public services, which I chair.  Its membership also includes the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.  The Minister of State with responsibility for public service transformation, Deputy Dara Calleary, who was appointed in March to strengthen the political leadership of the transformation programme, is also a member of the Cabinet committee.  Other Ministers and Ministers of State attend meetings as necessary.The Cabinet committee on transforming public services has met on nine occasions to date.  The committee last met on 24 March and will meet again tomorrow.  In addition, the steering group of Secretaries General which supports the work of the Cabinet committee meets on a very regular basis.  The Cabinet committee will meet regularly over the coming months to ensure progress on the implementation of the commitments in the transforming public services programme and the public service agreement 2010-14.  To date, progress has been made in a number of areas of the programme.Examples of this progress include a range of instruments in the human resource area which continue to contribute to the implementation of expenditure savings for this year, notably the incentivised scheme of early retirement in the public service, the special Civil Service career break scheme and the shorter working year scheme, together with the moratorium on the filling of public service vacancies by recruitment or promotion.A new e-Government strategy for 2010 has been approved by the Cabinet committee.  The strategy highlights new approaches to overcome some of the difficulties with putting certain services on-line and should thereby help to achieve an improvement in the use of electronic means for delivering public services.  The Department of Finance is engaging bilaterally with organisations to help them with their analysis and development work.  It should be noted that according to the latest European Commission e-Government benchmarks, Ireland's ranking for on-line sophistication has now improved from 17th position in 2007 to joint 7th position.The national procurement service, established in 2009, continues to leverage the public service's buying power by organising procurement of common goods and services across the public service.  During 2009, in addition to achieving better value on procurement spend, savings of €27 million were achieved by public bodies with the support of the unit.  Additional savings of at least €40 million are being targeted in 2010.Work is ongoing on specific proposals in the area of shared services on the basis that there are significant potential savings associated with such initiatives.  Work is currently being advanced on shared services in a number of sectors in areas including human resources, pensions administration, payroll and financial management.  The organisational review programme has been extended in order that all Departments and major offices will be reviewed over the next three years.  This team, which is based in my Department, carries out and publishes assessments of the capacity of individual Departments and major offices to meet their challenges over the coming years.Four organisations were reviewed last year, the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority.  These reviews are due to be published in early July and will be accompanied by follow-up action plans on the key findings prepared by each of the four organisations.  An additional three organisations are being reviewed this year, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is also being reviewed this year, with this review being led by a senior official from the Department of Finance.  Work is progressing on the development of new performance and governance frameworks for State agencies and the greater use of service level agreements in this context.As Deputies are aware, the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has now ratified the public service agreement 2010-14 This is a very important step in our collective efforts to meet the challenges we face, and this agreement will result in significantly enhanced public services and a more cost-effective and better integrated public service.  I want to acknowledge the contribution of many people in the union movement for their leadership in securing ratification.  It is the Government's intention to enter into and operate the agreement in good faith, including the provisions relating to the review of public service pay.  All concerned must now work together to ensure that the agreement is implemented in a timely and ambitious manner.For its part, the Government is instructing senior management across the entire public service to accord the highest possible priority to implementing the agenda for change set out in the agreement.  We are engaging with the public services committee of ICTU to finalise membership of the management-union implementation body, which has been given a role in driving the process of change and ensuring that any difficulties which may be encountered are resolved in a fair and speedy manner.As outlined in the Government statement on the public service agreement issued on 16 June, we will shortly announce the membership of a new public service board, with a majority of members from outside the public service, to advise the Government on further opportunities and priorities for transformation and efficiency and the capacity of the public service to lead change and deliver a high standard of performance.  This will inform the approach of the Government and public service management to the transformation process over the period ahead.In order to strengthen the capacity to lead change and deliver efficiencies as rapidly as possible, a number of senior appointments, including a chief information officer, will be made to bring greater expertise to the leadership of change in the critical areas of e-Government, shared services and public procurement.  To underline the commitment to appointing the best people available from within or outside the public service to senior positions, the Government will shortly announce the details of a new approach to such recruitment by reconstituting the top level appointments committee with more outside members.  In addition, to promote greater mobility at senior levels in the public service, we will also announce details of the new senior public service, encompassing initially the assignment and development of all Secretaries General and assistant secretaries and equivalents in Departments.It is clear that the challenge of doing more with less requires a fresh approach to the design and delivery of public services and the management of the organisations responsible for them.  I am confident that the public service at all levels has the capacity for change and innovation and that the terms of the Croke Park agreement provide the means of realising that capacity to the full.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I wish to ask a couple of questions arising from the Taoiseach's long and comprehensive reply.  He set out a range of activities and bodies, including a programme office, a Cabinet sub-committee and an implementation body under the public service pay agreement.  Will the lead Department in respect of the transformation of the public service be the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance?I understand an implementation body is to be established under the public service pay agreement.  He indicated that discussions on the establishment of that body are ongoing.  When does he intend this body to be established and by whom will its chairperson be appointed?  It was to be composed of three members from the management side and a further three from the public service unions, along with an independent chairperson.  Is it intended that the chairperson will be appointed by agreement of both sides?  Am I correct in my understanding that all the initiatives for reform and transformation, and the entire public service process, will be subject to the implementation body and that the various proposals will be put before it?The Taoiseach indicated that reviews of four Departments are now complete and the results will be published in July, while reviews of another four Departments are under way.  When these reviews are completed, is it the intention that the changes likely to take place within the Departments will be brought before the implementation body for implementation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The question of the structures we are putting in place for transforming the public service is the subject of a joint memo from my Department and the Department of Finance.  I have appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to both Departments to pull this together.  I chair the Cabinet sub-committee which oversees this work.  I have outlined the composition of the sub-committee.On the question of providing people to the chief information officer, public procurement issues and the shared services issue, the appointments will be made by the Department of Finance and will operate from the Department but they will have a system wide remit to make sure we get full implementation, if one likes, of the potential savings that have been identified, particularly in the shared services area.The board to be established, which will have a majority of outsiders on it, will drive the implementation of the transforming public services paper.  It will be chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary and overseen by a Cabinet committee chaired by me.The implementation body has a specific remit or function under the public service pay agreement.  In respect of the transformation areas, the transformation agreements which form part of the public service agreement will be implemented and where issues arise that need to be resolved, they will be resolved through the implementation body procedure which will short-circuit, if one likes, normal IR, Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court arrangements which have developed over a longer period.  As an indication of everyone's intention to implement as quickly as possible, there are time limited periods under the agreement whereby the implementation body will make decisions on any issues referred to it within six weeks.The implementation body is specific to the public service agreement and the transformation agreements that arise out of it in the various sectors.  The overall drive for public service transformation has been outlined in the OECD report and the task force which produced the plan for implementing that.  This will be done under the Civil Service board.  The implementation body has a specific remit and does not feed into other issues.  It deals with the specific issues under the public service agreement.  The chairperson of the implementation body will be appointed by the Government.  He or she will be a person who is acceptable to all and well got with everybody to do the job.The Deputy also asked whether the remit of the implementation body was wider than the public service agreement.  That is not the case.  The body is there for a specific purpose, that is, to implement the agreement.  Obviously, we will work in partnership with the unions in terms of the wider transforming public services issues that have to be addressed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	3	To clarify the role of the implementation body, my understanding was that the programme of transformation across the public service was incorporated into the public service agreement and would, therefore, be subject to the terms of the agreement.  Is my understanding in this matter not correct?In the 2009 budget the Government announced the amalgamation, reorganisation and reconfiguration of a number of State bodies.  I believe a total of 30 bodies were listed at the time.  What progress has been made in this regard?  I understood legislation was required, certainly in respect of some of the bodies in question.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what is the position in this regard?The pay agreement makes a number of references to public service pensions.  One reference is in respect of the introduction, by 1 January 2011, of legislation for a new public service pension scheme.  What is the position in this regard?  There was also to be a review of the method of determining pension increases for existing public service pensioners.  When will this review be undertaken and when are we likely to see the outcome of it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	4	They are taking place during the course of this year.  The implementation body is set up in the context of the agreement that was reached, therefore, it has its role to play in implementing this agreement.  It is why it is called the implementing body and it will ensure that the implementation of the agreement is proceeded with.  There are arrangements under the agreement as to how the implementation body will assist in every way it can, using its expertise to obtain agreement at the local level.  There are issues to be resolved at the local level that would be different depending on the circumstances in terms of what redeployment is necessary and how the rosters are to be arranged.  As the Deputy is aware, that is a very detailed arrangement that would be dealt with at the local level.  Where an issue arises, where there is a blockage or a non-agreement on some aspect of how all that is to work, then the implementation body would deal with it and make a finding which would then inform how the matter would be resolved.  In terms of the mechanics and the day-to-day implementation of the public service agreement, the implementation body has the lead role.The question of how to develop a wider integrated public service, which is a wider agenda than simply the matter of the agreement, is being driven forward by the public service board.  Again, it is not in the operational area.  The operational area will remain at the level of the normal IR processes.  The issue of how to develop training, management development, how to get systems in place to ensure that we change the culture and get people involved in that area, is done through the board.  The political oversight of that will be through the Cabinet committee system.Those are the arrangements and I am satisfied that there is a big body of work to be done.  I have every confidence that everyone will proceed with it with a view to ensuring we get the outcomes that are agreed.

Would he not accept that the ban on recruitment is a very blunt instrument that takes no account of the need to maintain and improve public services to people, front-line services in particular?  It is having a detrimental effect across all the public services.  Is he aware of the impact it is having on our local authorities, our city and county councils in the main, which are not able to carry out all their current functions and responsibilities?  Perhaps the Taoiseach is still dealing with the——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am listening.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Very good.I have mentioned the local authorities.  Is the Taoiseach also aware of the impact it is having on our health services?  In particular is he aware that over the next three years if the current recruitment embargo is to remain in place we will lose a further 6,000 posts?  We will have a further 6,000 unfilled posts as a result of that embargo over the next three years if it is to remain in place as it is currently employed.  Is the Taoiseach aware that more than 40% of front-line nursing staff are over the age of 50 years, which of itself must underscore the importance of a revisitation of this very blunt instrument?  We will see an already chaotic position become utterly calamitous right across health service provision both in terms of acute hospital networks and all the other service provision within the primary, community and continuing care end of the HSE's responsibilities.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Does the Deputy have a question?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Both UNITE and the INMO rejected the Croke Park deal but has the Taoiseach noted they have accepted that the greater number of public service workers across all the unions representing them have decided to accept the deal, and both UNITE and the INMO have in turn accepted such a position and are now willing to work with it?  In that context, would the Taoiseach be prepared to demonstrate some flexibility in the area given the evidence of the enormously negative impact of the recruitment embargo and what lies ahead if it is to remain in place?  Does the Taoiseach have an opportunity, with the Croke Park deal over the line, to demonstrate flexibility in response to the critical need for revisitation of the issue in the interest of front-line services and the needs of our wider communities?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The agreement has been made and it is for all of us to proceed with its implementation and the wider transformation of public services agenda.  There is an acknowledgement from everybody that the status quo will not enable us to maintain and develop public services based on the Exchequer arrangements.  The moneys available are such that this must happen.The purpose of much of this work is to the greatest extent possible maintain public services on the front line.  The embargo is not rigid in that respect and there are arrangements for front-line services in various sectors.  They must be applied for and positions cannot be filled automatically.I made a point yesterday on intellectual disability services and using this or disability services in general as an example, we spend €1.2 billion on the area, with €900 million on intellectual disabilities and €300 million for physical and sensory disabilities.  It is a considerable commitment to meet a need.  There are many section 38 and section 39 organisations — so called under the relevant sections of the Health Acts — which deliver these services.  If there are 178 agencies throughout the country providing those services and we try to maintain front-line services, we must consider those not on the front line and see what kind of initiatives will make for a more effective delivery of the service.  One must consider how to join up separate payroll systems and services, as well as a range of areas that must be addressed in order to maintain front-line services.  If we are not prepared to confront that agenda, we are indicating that as we do not have as much money as before, we will not be in a position to maintain services.The front line should be and is the objective, although some support services are required because there cannot be consultants without secretaries.  We all understand there are certain support frameworks necessary to make the front line work effectively.  We have built up over a long period in our systems many areas that can be examined in their process of delivery.  We must consider the non-front-line costs involved in maintaining such services and to what extent we can release some of those costs on the basis of rationalisation and better arrangements than those which exist currently.  These are not easy issues to resolve but they must be considered in order to find solutions.The Deputy asked a question on public service numbers in general.The Government has confirmed that its policy on staff numbers in the public service is a matter which is independent of the draft public service agreement.  However, the Government has clarified that the application of the moratorium on recruitment and promotion will be kept under review and will be revisited in each sector as staffing levels to be specified in the employment control framework for the sectors are achieved.  That is the position in respect of that matter.On the general point made by the Deputy, I am very much of the view that we must proceed with implementation of the agreement as it stands.  I do not believe a question of our revisiting the agreement arises.  We have only just obtained, through a process of consultation and balloting, an outcome in respect of this agreement and must now implement it.  It is a challenging and ambitious agreement, one which provides for a series of changes which I believe most people would welcome and that are necessary in the context of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  On the issue of employment levels and so on, the agreed redeployment measures and flexibility in regard to rosters, which bring their own savings in terms of how and in what way people are working, will assist us in maintaining public services to the greatest extent possible.  We will through redeployment be able to release people from work in one area to another where necessary.  That is the situation as envisaged in the agreement.  We must get on with implementing rather than revisiting the agreement.In response to the previous questions in regard to the changes envisaged in respect of public service pensions, it was announced in budget 2010 that a new single public service pension scheme would be introduced for new entrants to the public service.  The necessary legislation and scheme to put this in place will be introduced later this year.  Deputies will be aware of the main provisions of the national pensions framework in this regard.  Other details of the new scheme will be considered by the Government in finalising relevant legislation following consultation between the Department of Finance and public service employers and unions, which is now under way.  The introduction of a new single pensions scheme will provide significant opportunities for administrative efficiencies to be introduced and will, in particular, allow for much greater centralisation of pension management and administration.The Deputy also raised the issue of existing pensions.  As I stated, the draft agreement provides that discussions on the pensions of existing public service pensioners and current public servants will take place in spring 2011 in the context of the review of pay.  I have already clarified that the Minister for Finance is reviewing the current arrangements.  In the prevailing circumstances, the Government has clarified that no change in the current arrangement for the indexation of pensions for current public service pensioners and serving public servants will be implemented during the period of the agreement.  It has acknowledged that nothing in the draft agreement commits the union side to any position on the issues involved.  The Government also accepts the dispute resolution provisions set out in the draft agreement do not apply to the proposed engagements on pensions in spring 2011.  A separate process of engagement between the Department of Finance and trade union representatives is under way to discuss pension scheme arrangements for new public servants.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	11	In response to the Taoiseach's reply — I will leave the additional information provided by him to Deputy Gilmore — I make no apology for revisiting the issue of the health services.  I am not at all surprised that the INMO voted as it did.  Is the Taoiseach not aware that the INMO presented alternative proposals in regard to the operation of a recruitment ban across the health services that would result in an adjustment in favour of front-line staff, including nurses, midwives and other critical staff?The difference would be made up from non-essential management and administration staff who are not front-line players in the overall HSE configuration.  Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the INMO proposals, which make great sense to the overwhelming number of people, particularly those who are waiting to access services but cannot do so because the system is understaffed and unable to cope with the presenting and potential throughputs?  When one deals with each individual case, one finds that the families of individual patients are distressed about this situation, as are the front-line service providers.  Now that the Croke Park deal has gone across the line, will the Taoiseach not take a fresh look at this matter, in a spirit of magnanimity and in recognition of the great and real distress that exists?  Will he respond accordingly — in an appropriate spirit — in the interests of patient safety and care in the first instance?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	12	As the Deputy is aware, the public services committee of Congress ratified the public service agreement at its meeting of 15 June last.  That agreement provides a comprehensive agenda for public service transformation.  It provides a framework for public service pay determination over the period to 2014.  It provides a framework for the detailed discussions that will now take place at local level.  The health service redeployment protocol, which is set out in chapter 6 of the agreement, governs the changes that are now put in place.  The agreement also provides for competence reskilling, education and training and for an appeal process.  There are four paragraphs relating to essential redeployment in the agreement.  The implementation of the redeployment protocol will be monitored by a steering committee comprising three management and three trade union nominees.  The committee may recommend, through the national joint council, amendments or enhancements to the scheme, including opportunities for reskilling and retraining based on experience gained through its operation.  The Deputy has suggested that we should renegotiate this section of the agreement to accommodate a particular union's view on the matter.  While I respect the views of unions on these matters, the public service committee of Congress has, through its balloting procedures, come up with a majority that is in favour of implementing the agreement.  We should now implement the agreement, work with everybody with the maximum of goodwill to get the changes in place on the ground and ensure that what has been agreed is implemented.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Some 26 months have passed since the OECD report came in.  Some 18 months have passed since the task force on public service reform, which followed that report, was asked to present its three-year plan to the Government.  In November 2008, the Taoiseach said there was a need to move quickly and decisively to allow as many services as possible to be accessed by means of e-government 24 hours a day, seven days a week  What progress can he report on that?  What proportion of Departments have e-government services that can be accessed by the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week?  According to the Taoiseach, this was meant to be an important element of the report to the Government.  Where are we on that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	14	According to the latest EU Commission e-government benchmarks, we have improved our ranking from 17th to seventh over the past two to three years.  The same benchmarks place Ireland in the top two for e-procurement services.  Examples of on-line services that have been progressed in the recent past include the census information and search facilities; the on-line system for the payment of charges on non-principal private residences; the on-line application for birth, marriage and death certificates; the automatic reminders when driving licences and passports expire; payment of the majority of court fines electronically; and the on-line declaration to the Garda Síochána for minor crimes.  The customer does not need to know the relevant Garda station as back-end processes ensure they are routed correctly.  We are one of the few countries in Europe that has put in place a high-speed national government network to which all public bodies can connect using any telecommunications operator in the Irish marketplace.  The Department of Finance is currently working with Departments, offices and agencies to develop a rolling programme of e-government projects.  In this regard, Departments are developing detailed e-government plans.Progress has been made on these specific projects in recent times.  Others are being rolled out.  Now that we have a public service agreement on transformation across all the main sectors — health, education and others, which are outlined in the agreement — we will be able to progress these projects and accelerate the e-government role.  The collation of electronic data and the availability of data across the system would greatly enhance the delivery of our public services.  In that respect, we are looking at legislative changes in the Public Service Management Act to facilitate this issue and overcome some data protection questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Public service reform is one of the fundamental and critical issues faced by the country.  The Department of Finance said recently that it wants responsibility for this to be vested in that Department.  The Minister for Finance has ordered an examination of how the Department does its business.  However, I understand that only two officials in the Department have banking expertise and that there are no statisticians at all in the Department.  The Taoiseach has allocated responsibility for public service reform to my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dara Calleary.  Given that reform is so fundamental to the efficient provision of services across all Departments and Government agencies, does the Taoiseach not consider this to warrant real clout at Cabinet, with direct input from the Taoiseach's office, to make it work?The Fine Gael Party took a particular view on the Croke Park agreement.  We would like to see the deal go through and would honour the pay element of it, with a different mandate in respect of public service reform.  This is a win-win situation for the trade unions, the people who work in the public service and the general public.  As Head of Government, does the Taoiseach not think this issue deserves one of the most powerful Ministers to drive it through all Departments?  I say this with respect to Deputy Calleary, who has been given responsibility for this matter.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I chair a Cabinet committee which has that overall responsibility but one must have an operational framework and an agreed way forward.  It is best to do this on an agreed basis, where one sits down in partnership with employee representatives and management working off an agreed template as to how one is going to implement changes.  A level of transformation has been agreed with regard to these matters and in these sectors.  These changes have been on the agenda for a long time and are now available for implementation.The process of negotiation, agreement and subsequent ratification has taken some time but it was time that needed to be invested so that people would see the win-win situation to which the Deputy referred.  Thankfully, we have an outcome that enables us to go forward.As I said in my initial reply, there have been developments in e-government, public procurement and other issues, such as the shared services agenda, which are being pushed along.    This public service agreement gives all of us the mechanism, so to speak, by which we can go ahead and do what we all want, namely, to see in what way we can provide the most effective and efficient public service possible, using all the potential that exists, not only within the public service and among the people who work there but also using various initiatives such as e-government and others that will assist in ensuring the costs of providing those services are the most effective, as far as the taxpayer is concerned.

In response to the significant loss in scheme funding, a range of administrative and legislative measures were introduced to assist schemes recover their scheme funding.  These measures were designed to ease the funding pressures on pension schemes and provide additional legislative support to secure the viability of a pension and, in the event of a wind-up of a scheme, to ensure that the assets of the scheme were distributed in a more equitable manner.The Pensions Board provides advice and guidance to scheme administrators.  However, trustees of pension schemes and employers are responsible for the affordability of the pension scheme and must take into account the costs of administering the scheme and the investment risks to ensure the protection of the members' benefits and secure the sustainability of the scheme in the long term.The national pensions framework includes a range of measures to strengthen the regulatory system.  These include the powers of the Pensions Board in regard to the regulation of pension schemes will be reviewed; regulation will be introduced to increase the transparency of pension charges; the funding standard will be kept under review; and the information being provided to scheme members will be kept under review and enhanced as considered necessary. The framework also sets out a possible approach to restructuring a pension scheme which might be considered by pension scheme trustees and employees.A technical implementation group was established in May to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms announced in the national pensions framework into operation.

The Minister will be aware it was announced that 75% of defined benefit schemes continue to be in deficit.  When one combines all of these, the shortfall is €25 billion, as I hope the Minister is aware.The Minister has enacted some changes that have assisted some, although not all, schemes.  He spoke about the pensions framework but last week the chief executive said that substantial risks continue to be taken and if the same strategies that caused much of the recent losses continue to be used the chances of further losses are too high.  That alarmed me and I would like to hear the Minister comment on it.The Minister said responsibility lies with trustees and employers.  I accept that and agree with it.  However, there is also governmental responsibility regarding oversight of all the schemes.  If these continue to operate in a manner that employs the same strategies that caused much of the recent losses, I wish to know what the Minister will do about this to ensure the schemes operate more responsibly.

In December 2008 a number of measures were introduced to ease the funding pressures on defined benefit schemes.  These measures mean the Pensions Board can now grant additional time for the preparation of funding proposals aimed at restoring pension funds; deal as flexibly as possible with applications for approval of funding plans; allow a longer period for recovery plans — more than ten years in appropriate circumstances; allow the term of a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan where the scheme is part way through a previous recovery plan but is off-track due to investment losses; and take into account voluntary employment guarantees in approving recovery plans.In order to ensure these extensions are not seen as a weakening of supervision the Pensions Board will reject recovery plans which fail to demonstrate an appropriate investment approach.  The operation of these arrangements will be reviewed by the Pensions Board no later than January 2011.

That is not my question.  In spite of the fact that 75% of pension schemes will not deliver what people expect of them, what will the Minister do about the fact that according to the chief executive of the Pensions Board, the schemes are still operating in substantially the same way and that the same risk is there?  What will he do to ensure that the pensions industry is more responsible and makes people aware of the risk they are taking?

There is very strong oversight from the Pensions Board.  I was asked a question at the press conference attended by the chief executive and I said it was very important that people's pension funds are protected.  If there is need for further steps to be taken, I will certainly look at them.  I believe that management at the Pensions Board believe they have enough powers at the moment——

A key aim of the framework is to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups, and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.  This will be achieved by the introduction of a new auto-enrolment system.  Employees earning above a certain income threshold will be automatically enrolled in this new scheme, with the employee, their employer and the State all making contributions.  The Government is also committed to seeking to ensure that the State pension remains at 35% of average earnings.The issue of the security of a pension scheme is a very important matter.  A number of measures were implemented since December 2008 to ease the pressures being felt by many pension funds.  Those measures were designed to ease the funding pressures on pension schemes, provide additional legislative support to secure their viability and, in the event of a wind-up of a scheme, to ensure that the assets of the scheme are distributed in a more equitable manner.  Furthermore, the Pensions Act was amended to allow for the restructuring of underfunded schemes, to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme, and to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board in ensuring that pension contributions deducted from wages and salaries are remitted by employers to scheme trustees.  This Act also introduced the pensions insolvency payments scheme to reduce the cost of purchasing pension payments by trustees of pension schemes for their members where the employer has become insolvent.A technical implementation group has started work to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms announced in the national pensions framework into operation.

What, if anything, will the Minister do about that?  How will he address the current funding deficits and how will he prevent those deficits occurring again in the future?  The Minister quoted some actions taken by his predecessor since 2008.  They really amounted to tinkering with the pensions system.  What actions will the current Minister take to ensure that the pension situation is made more secure, given the scale of the deficits that exist at the moment?  What will he do to lower the risk profile of Irish pension funds?  Has he anything in mind to address that issue?  Is he prepared to carry out a review of which investments are appropriate for pension funds?  A key criticism made by the Pensions Board was that the investments that had taken place over recent years were high risk investments.  That is why so much money was lost from pension funds.Is the Minister prepared to get investment managers to clarify to their clients the risks that they are taking?  Pension policy holders are simply not aware of these risks.  Is he prepared to introduce a pension insurance scheme?  Will he legislate to ensure companies can no longer walk away from defined benefit schemes that are insolvent?  Will he consider extending the PIPS scheme?

I would like to see the risk profile lowered and I will be talking to the new chairperson of the Pensions Board this week, as I believe that the pensions issue is very important.  The first pension for most people is the contributory old age pension, and the objective is to maintain that at 35% of the average industrial wage.  That is the first priority because we must ensure that the most universal pension is protected.I am a little bit surprised at the question about the risk profile.  The Government has been accused of not taking away policies because we ensured that people's investments in banks, bonds and so on were secure.  Proposals are being put about by people that we should have put those bonds at risk.  This would have meant that even what were considered safe investments would have become risky.  The Government policy has been quite clear.  We believe that what were considered safe investments by pension funds should remain safe investments, and that this would extend to bonds held in Irish banks, as well as to deposits held in Irish banks.  This is fundamental to ensuring that safe investments continue to be considered safe.The primary responsibility for the oversight of pension funds rest with the Pensions Board, but I will be entering into discussions with the board and if there is a need for further changes, I will certainly look at them.

Does the Minister intend to provide more staff at the Pensions Board?  It recently stated that it does not have the staff and expertise to carry out its functions adequately at the moment.  There is a contradiction to this approach, because it also returned a surplus of €400,000 to the Department and reduced the fees to pension schemes by 7.5%.  Does the Minister have confidence in the Pensions Board and in its ability to do the task given to it?  This crisis has happened on the board's watch.  How does he intend to proceed in respect of reform of the board?

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently more than 95,500 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 60% since the end of 2007.  More than 37,800 have been in payment for 18 months or more.The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities.  Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.  Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 27,240 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005 — 14,833 rent supplement recipients transferred to the RAS and a further 12,407 recipients transferred to other social housing options.It is accepted that progress in regard to the RAS was initially slower than expected.  However, the pace of delivery has improved significantly.  In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred to RAS and social housing in 2008 and 2009, thus achieving the targets set for the RAS and social housing transfers for these years.  The target established for 2010 is for a further 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIn consultation with the Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers.  These include allowing applicants for the RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme.  Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can seek applicants for social housing support directly from households in long-term receipt of rent supplement as part of a choice-based lettings approach to allocations.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of the RAS implementation groups.  The purpose of these groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long-term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.

I cannot envisage a situation in the near future where rent supplement will not be needed.  Given that in excess of one third of recipients are in receipt of it for more than 18 months, my concern is that it is not achieving what it was supposed to achieve.The Minister is responsible for the scheme.  We discussed the concept of joined-up Government thinking at a meeting yesterday and this is another example of where there is not joined-up Government thinking.  The transfer rates to the RAS are less than ambitious.  The initial targets in 2005 or so were more ambitious than the current targets.  What discussions has the Minister had with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure the rent budget is reduced by ensuring that the Department plays its part in ensuring people are transferred to the RAS?  The figures the Minister gave for 2007 and 2008 included the RAS and social housing as distinct from the RAS alone.  The RAS is popular with the public and with the people who need it but it is a major issue for people to be transferred to it.I am sure the Minister will accept that it also beneficial in terms of eliminating poverty traps. One can be in receipt of rent supplement and then be assessed for the RAS and on being transferred to it a person can be lifted out of the poverty trap.  It is only supposed to be a short-term support.  What will be done to ensure that more people who have been on the list for 18 months will be transferred to the RAS?

I agree with what the Deputy said.  It is not satisfactory that people are in long-term receipt of rent supplement, particularly where there are children involved.  Moving from house to house and from school to school can often create great instability.  I agree with the Deputy that this issue needs to be tackled.I am sure the Deputy is interested in the figures involved.  The total private and voluntary transfers to the RAS was 505 at the end of 2005, 2,333 in 2006, 2,918 in 2007, 3,645 in 2008, 3,999 at the end of  2009, and 1,433 for the current year to May.  When those figures are broken down between the 30 or so local authorities, those involved do not constitute a huge number.  I will discuss with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, how we might progress this matter.  I will also meet representatives of the various groups, namely, Simon and Threshold.As the Deputies will probably be aware since I took up this office I have been very busy.  One reason I am looking forward to the plenary sessions of the Dáil ending is that much of the work that needs to be done with the Departments, officials and so on, is done when the Dáil is not in session.  We have to try to get to a situation where there is a  much bigger transfer of people from the temporary solution of rent supplement to a permanent solution of either social housing or the RAS.  One of the attractions of the RAS is that it creates greater integration in housing rather than the social exclusion of some estates in the past.

The Department of Social Protection has done what it can, regardless of whether we agree with it, in terms of cuts in the rent supplement.  The Minister has made it as unattractive as he possibly can and while that might not have been the intention, that is what he has done.  There is some merit in some of the ways he went about doing that.  His most recent decision at least took into account varying prices in different areas, which I welcome.  The Minister cannot do all that is required unless the other Department plays its role.  From the point of view of having cohesive Government, will we see action on this and will the Minister try to force action on the part of his ministerial colleagues in Government to ensure that this problem is tackled?  It involves €0.5 billion a year out of a budget that he knows will be squeezed.

Some of the issues I examined regarding the scheme in my Department were not focused on the transfer issue, which is important, but on the scheme.The Deputy mentioned the level of rent and dealing with that issue involved a considerable amount of time.  I am happy that the level of rent reflects prices in the market.  Determining the right level of rent is an issue when the rent subsidy scheme is such a big player in the market.  I do not want to try to price anybody out of the market but I do not want to have unnatural subsidies for landlords as well.Many issues arise here, some directly and exclusively related to the rent subsidy scheme.  I want to discuss it with the various housing groups and following that if I consider it would be beneficial to have further discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, I will do so.  There is a need for joined-up Government thinking on this issue.  We also have to examine issues relating to the rent subsidy scheme, having regard to the way differential rents are charged which are different from that pertaining to this scheme, to ensure that there are no disincentives to transferring.

These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  Since 2001, increases in social welfare rates, including fuel allowance, have exceeded energy product prices.The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks each year from end September to end April.  In the 2009-10 heating season more than 340,000 recipients benefited from the allowance at a cost of over €231 million.  Some 376,000 pensioners are receiving the household benefits, which provides 2,400 electricity units per annum, or the gas equivalent, over the year and it is estimated that some 140,000 of these households are receiving both fuel allowance and the electricity units-gas allowance under the household benefits to assist with the heating and other energy requirements.  The household benefit package cost €184 million in 2009.Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tackling fuel poverty.  Initiatives such as the warmer homes scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disabilities.  Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.In his carbon budget statement, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government outlined details of €130 million in funding for insulation, €76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an interdepartmental agency group on affordable energy to co-ordinate and drive Government policy in this area.The interdepartmental agency group has been asked to draw up an energy affordability strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.   As part of its work, the group was asked to make recommendations on the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.  These recommendations will be considered as part of the overall strategy to deal with energy affordability.

There was much toing and froing in regard to it yesterday, with two separate letters being issued to me.  The first indicated that the question could not be taken as a priority question, and the second indicated the question was not in order.  It was only when I pointed out that my colleagues and I have already posed the same question three or four times that I was allowed to submit it.I have absolutely no faith in the inter-agency group.  The first time its members attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs three or four years ago was probably the worst joint committee meeting I have ever attended.  All members were horrified at the lack of information the delegates were able to provide.  They attended a later meeting and that was somewhat more useful.  Nevertheless, the group has been meeting for some years but we are yet to see a report.  When will it be published?My question specifically asks what will be done to offset the increase in fuel costs for low-income families arising from the introduction of the carbon tax.  The Minister studiously avoided that point in his reply.  The fuel allowance scheme, as it is currently comprised, was utterly unresponsive to people's emergency needs during the recent harsh winter.  Is the group taking that aspect into consideration?  Will the Minister deal with the specific question of how it is proposed to offset the increase in fuel costs for low-income families as a consequence of the carbon tax?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Deputy has asked this question on previous occasions and I have had no difficulty in answering it.  I expect to receive the report to which she referred over the summer period.  As the Deputy rightly points out, and as I have said from the beginning, the months during which significant heating costs arise are those from October through to spring, that is, the months for which the fuel allowance is payable.  As I said, I am awaiting the report of the strategy group.  It will have to go to Cabinet, after which we will make a decision on how to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.  I envisage a dual approach in this regard.  The Deputy has focused on cash assistance, but the other side of the coin is equally important, namely, the question of how we can help people to reduce their energy requirements.  Yesterday, we discussed the transfer of the schemes.  I expect activation to play a role in insulating some houses.An issue that is relevant to this and to the Deputy's previous question relates to my discovery, having begun to examine data on fuel poverty, that people living in rented accommodation are far more likely than those in owned occupation to complain that their homes are cold.  This is a factor that I must take into consideration not only in regard to this issue, but also in the context of the previous question.

I have not lost focus on the other side of this issue, as the Minister claims.  The warmer home scheme is fantastic if one can manage to avail of it.  The problem is one of accessibility.  While the various penalties have all been introduced, action to introduce measures to assist people in ensuring their homes are warm has not kept pace.  Everybody was hit with the carbon tax on 1 May regardless of income.  Some can afford to insulate their homes and others cannot; my concern is that we have not bridged that gap.The Minister says the report will be available soon, and I have no choice but to take him at his word.  We have submitted questions time and again on this issue, and on each occasion the response was that the report would be published "soon".  Can the Minister offer an assurance that a decision will be made in the autumn session to assist people on low incomes to meet the additional costs of the carbon tax?

I have not seen a report from the strategy group, but we will continue pressing for it to be brought forward, after which we will have to make decisions on it.  To clarify, from the time I came into the Department it was my understanding that the deadline by which action would have to be taken to implement supports for low-income households in terms of fuel affordability was the autumn, when the heating season begins, rather than the summer.

Expenditure for the year ending December 2009 was €60.7 million, and the Estimate for 2010 is €63.9 million.  The mortgage interest supplement scheme is currently under review.  The main purpose of this review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis.  The review group includes representatives from my Department, the community welfare service, Department of Finance, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the Office of the Financial Regulator.As part of the initial review, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues were drawn up and circulated to the community welfare officers.  These guidelines are available on the Department's website.  The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator's statutory code of practice on mortgage arrears and legislative and operational issues arising.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme's objectives are warranted in light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.More recently, the Government has established a broader and more comprehensive review of mortgage arrears and personal debt.  The mortgage arrears and personal debt review group, under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, comprises representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Department of Justice and Law Reform, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In addition, the group has representatives from the Office of the Financial Regulator, the ESRI, the Irish Banking Federation, the Free Legal Advice Centres and the Law Reform Commission.The terms of reference for the group are based on the renewed programme for Government, with an emphasis on protecting the family home.  They include a review of the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Banking Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default, with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations in order to avoid foreclosure.  In addition, the group is examining measures adopted in other jurisdictions and considering ways of expanding existing mortgage support measures.  I understand the group will report to the Minister for Finance in the coming weeks.

On behalf of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, the Minister's colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and I met with the Cooney group to discuss this issue.  I have a concern in that whatever decisions the group reaches, the Minister's Department is solely responsible for the operation of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  The departmental review of this matter, which I understand is to be published soon, has been ongoing since the Minister's predecessor and her predecessor were in situ.  In other words, three Ministers have overseen a review that has not as yet produced a report.  Has any such report been completed and has it been seen by the Cooney group?  It is difficult to see how the latter can come to any decisions without having at its disposal practical information as to the application, whether good or bad, of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  Has the group looked at the inconsistencies in the application of the scheme throughout the State?  Colleagues and I are aware that different decisions are being made in different areas.

As I said, there will be a separate departmental report on the mortgage interest supplement scheme, but that must mesh in with the work of the Cooney group.  I expect both reports to be published at approximately the same time, as the same departmental staff are involved in both.  I have spoken to Mr. Cooney about this issue and am in constant contact with my officials.  I hope this matter will be progressed in the coming weeks.  The Government agrees that decisions are required urgently on this matter.

They are now worried about the possibility of having to pay a property tax in addition to everything else, especially those who are in negative equity.  A report in one of today's newspapers indicated that a decision would be made in October.  However, the longer this is let slide, the greater the numbers who will experience hardship and the more difficult it will be to assist those whom it is possible to assist — and there are many such — to keep their homes.

I have not seen the Cooney report and, as such, am not aware of what delivery mechanisms are proposed, whether they can be implemented immediately or whether there will be a lead-in time.  As I said, both reports should be available in the coming weeks and decisions will be made speedily thereafter.  I do not know what the complexities of implementation would be but I agree about the urgency of this issue and the importance of saving people's homes where possible.  This is different from looking at the mortgage interest supplement on its own because in many cases we are looking at a range of debts, not just the mortgage.  Without taking a total view, it is not possible to resolve people's financial issues and that is an important part of the Cooney report.

This is where MABS has a big role to play in drawing up financial plans after getting all of the information from clients; if a client only gives half of the information, the problem cannot be solved.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I propose to take Question Nos. 37, 44, 45, 58 and 421 together.There are 16,800 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, compared to 8,000 recipients in 2008.  Expenditure for the year ending December 2009 was €60.7 million and the Estimate for 2010 is €63.9 million.Generally, all applications for mortgage interest supplement are recorded electronically.  However, as this practice can vary across community welfare areas, full statistics for the number of people who applied for mortgage interest supplement are not available.  Community welfare officers have been reminded on many occasions to record the details of receipt and status of all claims electronically.  However, requests to change operational procedures must be viewed in the context of the increased demands being placed on community welfare officers in the current economic environment.The mortgage interest supplement scheme is currently under review.  The main purpose of this review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis.  The review group includes representatives from my Department, the community welfare service, the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the Office of the Financial Regulator.  As part of the initial review, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues were drawn up and circulated to the community welfare officers.  These guidelines are available on the Department's website at www.welfare.ie.The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator's statutory code of practice on mortgage arrears and legislative and operational issues arising.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme's objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.More recently, the Government has established a broader and more comprehensive review of mortgage arrears and personal debt.  The mortgage arrears and personal debt review group, under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, comprises representatives from my own Department, the Departments of Finance; the Taoiseach; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Justice and Law Reform; and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In addition the group has representatives from the Office of the Financial Regulator, the ESRI, the Irish Banking Federation, the Free Legal Advice Centre and the Law Reform Commission.The terms of reference for the group are based on the renewed programme for Government, with an emphasis on protecting the family home.  They include a review of the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default, with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations to avoid foreclosure.  In addition, the group is examining measures adopted in other jurisdictions and considering ways of expanding existing mortgage-support measures.  The group will report to the Minister for Finance in the coming weeks.  The conclusions and recommendations from the review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which is currently being finalised, will inform the work of this group.

In the past, there have been difficulties getting figures for those who apply and those who have been refused.  I am concerned about the different ways this is operated.  The Minister says guidelines have been sent out, and perhaps they have, but I am still getting different responses as to why people are being refused and the length of time for getting it in some places.  There does not appear to be any clear operation of this across the community welfare service.When the Minister gets the report in the next few weeks, will there be changes in the operation of mortgage interest supplement?  I do not know what will be in the report, but there are problems here that need to be tackled.Has the Minister any view on the way the financial institutions are using the mortgage interest supplement?  I have had people come to me who tell me the bank has told them it will not foreclose if they get mortgage interest supplement.  When they are refused mortgage interest supplement, the banks treat them more harshly, although it was the bank who gave them the loan in the first place.  The community welfare officer decides that person should never have got the loan, which is great with hindsight, but it leaves people in a difficult position.  Has the Minister discussed this with the Minister for Finance?  We are guaranteeing the banks but they are treating people harshly.

I also spoke to Mr. Hugh Cooney about it.  It is important that the benefit of the mortgage interest supplement is to the mortgage holder.  Many parties have a part to play in resolving this; the banks lent the money and in some cases they did less than their homework before doing so.  We have all come across such cases.  l have noted the Deputy's remarks about the uniform application of the scheme and it is important, as far as possible, that there is uniform applications of the rules.  Different referees interpret the rules differently, however, and no matter how rules are codified, different interpretations are possible.  I will discuss this further with my officials to see if there are any further ways to ensure that.Without pre-empting the report, the beginning of resolution to a person's debt problems, if he is in serious difficulty and his problems cannot be resolved by meeting with the bank, must be a meeting with MABS to work out the total financial situation independently.  Otherwise the situation the Deputy mentions arises.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The Minister's general response to the issue seems to be that someone somewhere should do something.  The Minister is in the position to act here and instead of reading out long answers, it would be better to engage in the topic and tell us what he intends to do rather than hiding behind prepared answers and talking about the Cooney report.  It is ludicrous that we do not know how many people apply for mortgage interest supplement.  That is a major gap in the information systems that should be addressed now.The mortgage interest supplement scheme has not been reformed since the mid-1990s.  It does not reflect the reality of the boom and post-boom years.  We now have a situation where many people, some of them on very low incomes, are being refused any kind of assistance under the scheme because of the arbitrary nature of the rules that apply.  Leaving aside the Cooney report, the Minister is responsible for the review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  That review was supposed to be ready at Easter 2009, then Easter this year and it is now 15 months overdue.  When does the Minister expect to get it?  The delay means more people will be in serious danger of losing their homes.  Let us have some action.

As I indicated to Deputy Enright, I expect the Cooney report in the next few weeks and the mortgage interest supplement report will be available at the same time because they are linked together inextricably.

They do not want reports or debates, they want action.  Huge amounts of money have been paid into the banking system.  What benefits do ordinary punters receive from that major investment which we have made as taxpayers?  It does not seem that ordinary people who have a mortgage that is now overdue receive the support to which they should be entitled.  I encourage the Minister to do something to make it worthwhile.

The process will be quite simple.  We will receive the two reports, the Government will consider them and then make decisions on foot of them.  Those decisions, to be made not by me but by the Government, will be made in the next few weeks, once we receive the reports.  However, I cannot — which the Deputy wants me to do today — tell her the decisions.  I have not seen the reports and therefore I cannot make decisions on them.  Of course I have my views on what should happen and I will bring them to the Cabinet table.  I share with everybody in the House concern about protecting the family home.  If I understand the tenor of Deputy Crawford's question, I believe the banks must be part of the solution and I also believe that MABS, in laying out and ascertaining the amount of debt in the first place and working out a financial plan, has a key role to play as a free State-provided service that is very professional.

He speaks about being concerned about people in danger of losing their homes but he allows this matter to drift so there is an inexcusable delay in producing the review.  Stop confusing this with the wider issues on debt, and there is no doubt that big problems exist.  I am asking about the specific review undertaken.  What is the reason for the delay in that?  When does the Minister expect that review to be complete?  When can we see a copy of it?

If Deputy Shortall would find "the next month" more satisfactory, I will say "within the next month".  This will mean that within four months of my arrival at the Department, this matter will be brought to finality.  Not only are we bringing the mortgage interest supplement review to finality, which is only part of the jigsaw, we are also bringing the Cooney report to finality and making decisions.

The fact the Minister has been in the job for only three months is no excuse for the fact that there has been no action on this since the review group was established more than three years ago.  Forget about that.  The Minister used it as an excuse on the previous occasion also and I do not know how many homes have been repossessed in the meantime.  It is not their fault that the Government has changed ministerial portfolios so often.The Minister is concerned with the issue of overall debt, as are we all.  If this is the case, why has the Minister not changed the regulations to allow community welfare officers take overall household debt into account when granting mortgage interest supplement?  They cannot do so.  If a person has a mortgage, some of which is based on a house and more based on an amalgamation of debt, he or she is not allowed receive mortgage interest supplement on the amalgamation of debt part but only on the part which funded the purchase of the home.  If the Minister is concerned about this why does he not deal with it?

This compares to the average number received over the previous four years of 15,000.  At the end of 2009, 16,000 appeals were on hand and that figure has now risen to 20,300.  In previous years, that number would have been in the region of 5,000 to 6,000.I understand that during 2009, the average time taken to process all appeals, that is those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing, was 24 weeks.  However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time falls to 15.8 weeks.  This represents an increase of two weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared to 2008.Supplementary welfare allowance is a payment of last resort and, therefore, appeals for this scheme are given priority by the social welfare appeals office.  The average time for processing these in 2009 were 6.5 weeks for cases dealt with on a summary basis, and 10.5 weeks where an oral hearing was required.During 2010, changes have been made to the organisation of an appeals officer's work with a view to having a greater number of appeals dealt with by way of summary decision and in a more speedy fashion.  As a result of these changes, the average time to deal with summary decisions on supplementary welfare allowance cases has reduced to 4.7 weeks, while the time taken to deal with oral hearings for this scheme has increased to 13 weeks.While the significant growth in the number of appeals is clearly impacting on processing times, it must also be remembered that the processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process, including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's medical assessors in certain appeal cases and further investigation by social welfare inspectors where required.  Circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant.  Delays can also occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings.  In some cases adjournments may be sought by appellants or their representatives.A number of initiatives are under way which are designed to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard, two additional appeals officers were assigned to the office in 2009; a number of additional staff are being assigned to the administration area of the office; the organisation of the work of the appeals officer has been changed so as to increase productivity; a project to improve the business processes in the office is under way and a number of improvements have already been implemented; and significant enhancements are being made to the office's IT and phone systems.Notwithstanding these measures, it is clear that additional staff are required in the short term to address the backlog that has developed.  It has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short-term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis.  To facilitate this initiative, the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, which is on Committee Stage, includes an amendment to allow these retired officers to decide appeal cases.  The chief appeals officer is closely monitoring the situation.

I asked a question on the average processing time.  The Minister then said if one takes out the most protracted cases it is not as bad as it looks.  The Minister gave us the figure for the overall average processing time, which is the issue.  The protracted cases are part of the problem.  The Minister cannot take them out and then tell us things are not as bad as they look because they are.Which payment types attract the most appeals?  Are they also the ones which are the most successful?  For example, what percentage of carer's allowance appeals are successful?  The Minister pointed out yesterday on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that only 2% of cases are appealed.  My concern is that almost 50% of appeals are partially successful or are successful.  That means there is a real problem with the initial decisions which are made.  Sometimes more information is provided, but we need to have a system in place which ensures that people know what information to give in the first place.

It is available in the appeals office report, a copy of which I am sure the Deputy has seen.  I have examined this a few times.  Off the top of my head, means tested cases tend to be a large number and are protracted.  Medical cases apply to carer's allowance, illness benefit and so on.  It is fair to say that the shortest cases involve things like whether the person concerned has enough contributions because they tend to be fairly black and white.

What is the Minister going to do about that?  He told us he will take on part-time retired social welfare appeals officers, which amounts to three additional staff in the office.  Why is the Minister not making the case to the Minister for Finance that recruiting more staff for the appeals office would result in savings to the State?  These delays are costing the State dearly.  Why does the Minister not present a business case to the Minister for Finance and let him know that by recruiting the additional staff that are necessary he will be saving the State money?

For example, as the Deputy is probably aware, in a lot of cases where further information is provided there is a short circuit system which goes back to the Department.  The Deputy can be assured that I will be working with the appeals office to try to address this issue on all fronts, including information technology, better work methods and so on.  I am determined to rapidly decrease the amount of time it takes to process appeals.  Deputy Enright made a very valid point in asking if there was any way we could reduce the number of appeals in the first place and have our decision making process such that fewer people would feel they wanted to appeal.  That is the first step in the whole process.  We will work through every step to try to make it more efficient and deliver a better service.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

This is in complete contradiction to the public statements made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a number of occasions.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	118	The Taoiseach's answer is typical of what is wrong with this Government because one cannot believe a word that comes out of his mouth.  He refuses to rule out flat rate water charges, despite the comments made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Yet, on page 5 of the renewed programme for Government the Government's intentions on this are very clear.  It states, "We will introduce charging for treated water use that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  It will be based on a system where households are allocated a free basic allowance with charging only for water use in excess of this allowance".  It is a complete contradiction of the briefing given by the Department of Finance to the Irish Independent and a complete contradiction of the statements made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Why is the Taoiseach not in a position to honour the pledge and commitment given in the programme for Government?  The system of flat rate water charges is unfair, inequitable and not environmentally sound because one ends up with a situation whereby the poor pay the same as the rich.  Fine Gael will oppose a flat rate water charge because we have taken a very firm view on metering and charges for water in excess of allowances granted.  In view of the comments made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the very clear statement in the programme for Government on this matter, will the Taoiseach now confirm that a flat rate water charge will not be introduced in December and will he bring some certainty to people's lives in regard to their family incomes?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	138	As we all know, the incomes of most households in this country have fallen over the past couple of years.  The Government led us to believe that the cost of living dropped in line with the fall in income suffered by families and households.  The publication yesterday of the EUROSTAT figures on prices is revealing.  They indicate the price of food in this country is 29% higher than the EU average, bread and cereals are 32% higher, meat is 21% higher and milk, cheese and eggs are 37% higher.  I know the Taoiseach will argue that the figures are based on a comparison of prices conducted in early 2009 but I have studied the changes in the consumer price index since that period and, adjusting accordingly, huge differences remain between this State and the rest of Europe.  I calculate the figures at 23%, 26%, 15% and 33%, respectively, for the aforementioned categories.  Farmers are experiencing reductions in the price of stock, food suppliers and producers tell us they are being squeezed, in particular by the big retail multiples, and now it appears that the consumer is being screwed.When I raised the issue of prices with the Taoiseach in May 2008, he informed me that he intended to invite in the National Consumer Agency for a discussion on the issue.  Since that time, we have been hearing from the Government that some kind of code of practice would be introduced for the grocery and retail sector generally.  That has not happened and the legislation providing for the establishment of a code on a statutory basis has not been introduced.  Meanwhile, there is a huge gap between prices in this country and the rest of the European Union.One of the problems we appear to face is that we cannot get to the bottom of the extent of profit taking by the big multiples because the Irish operations of UK multiples are not required to publish separate accounts.  Similarly, privately and family-owned multiples are not required to publish their accounts.  Will the Government consider introducing or amending legislation to require multiples which are operating in the Irish retail sector, particularly in the grocery trade because this impacts most seriously on families, to publish annual accounts so that we can get an idea of the extent to which these operations take excessive profits from their activities in this country?  This is particularly important given that the prices paid to farmers and producers have decreased even while consumers are charged prices that are way out of line with the rest of Europe.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	139	As the Deputy noted, food prices in Ireland have decreased significantly since that survey was conducted last year.  The latest bulletin from the Central Statistics Office, which is the statutory agency for these matters, indicates that the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 6.3% in the 12 months to May 2010.  That compares to an increase in food prices of 1.5% over the same period in the UK, as recorded in the latest retail prices index published by the UK Office for National Statistics.  The differential in food prices is narrowing, therefore.I take the point that we must continue to work on finding a balance between producers and consumers.  Those who produce our food should be able to obtain a living.  Thankfully, there have been increases in the price of milk in recent months.  The volatility in exchange rates between sterling and the euro has not been helpful in terms of ensuring full price transparency or equating changes and trends, but the overall position is that food prices have been decreasing in Ireland.Historically, we have had a situation in which we needed to work towards a code of practice.  In September, John Travers was appointed by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come forward with proposals.  In addition to the cost of living, there are labour costs, energy prices and rents.The Deputy posed a question on food prices which I will have to refer to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Billy Kelleher, for further investigation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I think the Taoiseach is living in a wonderland regarding this issue.  I acknowledged in my previous question that food prices have decreased by 6.3% between the beginning of 2009 and May 2010 but they increased again in May.  The same pattern can be discerned in respect of bread and cereals, meat and milk, cheese and eggs.  There is no getting away from the fact that prices here are out of line with the rest of Europe.  Sterling is a factor when one compares prices between Ireland and the UK but it clearly does not apply with regard to eurozone countries.Two problems arise.  First, there is a lack of urgency on the part of the Government to deal with the problem of prices.  Two years is too long to be waiting for what amounts to a voluntary code of practice for the big supermarket chains.  Second, while I appreciate the Taoiseach has indicated that he will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to investigate my proposal, we need to see, at a minimum, the bottom line for the big chains.  If we are in an environment where farmers are not getting paid the proper price, food producers and suppliers are being squeezed by hello money and all kinds of practices and people's incomes have dropped, it is not acceptable that the price of basic foodstuffs — the products going into the trolleys in the supermarkets — are 30% above the rest of the European Union.  The Government needs to take action to address this issue and I ask it to do so.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Tánaiste, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, spoke to the large supermarket chains at the time those issues were being raised.  Indeed, she personally raised them with the National Consumer Agency.  There was a reduction of prices on a range of products across the board as a result because the retail sector had to take on board the fact that the differentials were not explicable simply by exchange rate movements or distribution costs.In recent months, we have also seen a big improvement in relation to the Northern Ireland situation with consumers voting with their feet by staying in the Republic and doing their shopping here to a greater extent than was the case 12 months ago.  This is a practical example of how competitiveness has improved and pricing has come more in line with what was available in Northern Ireland and which resulted in many people going up there to shop.  The number doing so has certainly declined in recent months.  There is, however, no room for complacency.The National Consumer Agency and Competition Authority are due to be merged as a means of enhancing the consumer protection area so that people will get the best possible prices in respect of those goods and services they need on an ongoing basis.  We will continue to work on that and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, will proceed with existing work and examine the issue raised today.

I will conclude with this point and await your answer, a Cheann Comhairle.  It will have escaped the notice of many in this House that the so-called transformation plan in 2008 that presented an enhanced ambulance service for the people of Monaghan when they lost the acute services of our hospital there, we had a rapid response vehicle——

You have not yet and never have previously given any substantive reply to give guidance and support to Members of this House as to how they can hold that Minister and this Government to account on the disgraceful decisions that have been taken on our health services.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	233	We have dealt with it.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I am clearly indicating now that the Labour Party is not agreeable to the proposal in respect of No. 5 and as such it has not yet been agreed to by the House.  We are not agreeing to it because this House is supposed to hold the Executive to account by debating legislation.  The number of guillotines applied this week make it impossible for us to do our constitutional duty and to hold the Executive to account.  What is happening in this House daily at the end of each term is that legislation is being passed by the Executive and not this House.  Legislation is simply being rubber-stamped by the majority, which is not the way to pass legislation.  We object to these guillotines.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 19 agreed?

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	241	In view of the list of legislation with which it was proposed the House would deal prior to its rising for the summer recess, perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate what legislation will be dealt with in the House next week.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The Whip has indicated to his colleagues the workload for this and next week.  It is unfortunately the case that there are Bills which must be dealt with before the end of term and we want to proceed with them.  The House will conclude the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010 today.  Second Stage of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 [Seanad] will be taken later this week.  The House will take Report Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 [Seanad] on Thursday and the European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010 has passed all Stages in the Dáil and is now listed for the Seanad.  The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 will be taken this Thursday.  The Road Traffic Bill 2009 and Health (Amendment) Bill 2010 have passed all Stages in the Dáil and are now listed on the Seanad Order Paper.  It is intended that the House will also deal with the Prescription Charges Bill 2010 and Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill 2010 [Seanad].  Report Stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2010 will be taken all next week in this House and will then go to the Seanad.  Report Stage of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 will be taken in the House this week and will then go to the Seanad.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I thank the Taoiseach for that information.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate if there has been any progress in regard to his commitment to introduce legislation in respect of on-line betting, which is an important issue in terms of the racing industry in this country.  I am aware the Bill is not yet ready but perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate when its heads might be prepared.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Work on that Bill is proceeding.  This issue was raised last week by Deputy Deenihan at which time I brought him up to date on the matter.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The European Commission today approved the extension of the credit institutions eligible liabilities guarantee scheme to the end of the year.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate if the Government intends bringing this matter before the House at any point, by what means this will be done and if it will happen before the summer recess.It is now several months since the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children agreed a wording for a referendum on the rights of children.  This is a matter on which there is now all-party agreement.  We are into the second last week of this Dáil term and it is high time the Government told us when the referendum on children's rights will be held and when the referendum Bill to enable that referendum to be held will be brought before this House.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate when this will happen.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	246	As stated previously in this House and again recently, work on that matter is continuing.  The matter is receiving the priority of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children who is liaising with the Attorney General's Office.  A Cabinet committee is also working on the matter.  As soon as all of the relevant issues have been cleared and each Department has had an opportunity to study what has been a comprehensive report the Government will bring legislation before the House.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	247	That is a load of nonsense.  There is not a comprehensive report.  The matter is a simple one.  There is agreement on the wording.  We are continually told work on the matter is continuing.  The only work continuing is on the part of Government to delay holding this referendum for as long as possible.  It beggars belief to see what order of priorities this Government has that a referendum on an issue as important as the rights of children, on which there is all-party agreement, is being delayed in this way by Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I reject the Deputy's assertion.  Work on this matter is ongoing.  The Government is seized of the issue and is proceeding to deal with it.  The Deputy will be aware that the bringing forth of a referendum is an important and serious matter which must be given due consideration by any Government, including this one.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Again in the health domain, a series of legislation has been promised by the Department of Health and Children.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to confirm that the health information Bill 2010 will be published in the current year?  It is indicated under Section B as due for publication in late 2010.  Has the Taoiseach at any time following the request of Opposition Deputies made any inquiry as to the reason health Bills tend always to arrive in the last weeks of any session and are invariably given little time for serious scrutiny?  Is there any prospect of the health information Bill 2010 and others within the health portfolio being presented earlier in the session post summer recess to allow Deputies to properly engage, evaluate and amend as appropriate?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Bills are published having been duly decided upon by Government.  There is no set trend in this regard on the part of Government.  Bills come before Government and are published.  It is then a matter for the Whips as to when they will be taken in the House.  The Deputy will be aware there has been a great deal of work before the Oireachtas as a result of the economic situation in recent times.  This has greatly increased our workload, a challenge which the House has been able to meet commendably.  Some Bills have passed all Stages in the Dáil and others have yet to be decided upon.  The legislation mentioned by the Deputy is due for publication at the end of the year, work on which we will try to speed up.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Cabinet sub-committee on climate change met only twice last year and six times the previous year.  It has not yet met in 2010.  Perhaps the Taoiseach in his capacity as Chairman of that sub-committee will indicate when the heads of the Bill on climate change law, which has been repeatedly promised, will come before the House.  I understand from the Department that it was expected that the heads of this Bill would be published in March.  I understood it would be published in June but there is still no framework, other than an original document which is thin on the ground in terms of detail, in place.Is the Government serious about tackling climate change?  I am aware it has other matters on its mind.  However, at the end of the day we must all work together to meet targets which are onerous on all Departments.  Without climate change law, which is part of a commitment made by Government, we will not achieve those targets.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The outcome of the Copenhagen conference in December has meant the preparatory process has taken longer than expected.  The Cabinet committee meets when there are decisions to be taken.  A great deal of work is being done at a technical level and a policy level in preparation for this sort of legislation.  It is important that we get it right.  That ongoing work is at an advanced stage.  I hope the Cabinet committee will meet as soon as decisions are ready to be considered by it.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I welcome the recent adjustments to the scheme of PRSI contribution on behalf of the employer.  The matter needs to be considered further, however, as the new arrangement is very proscriptive in so far as only those who have been out of work for over 12 months will qualify for it.  Several people have approached me——

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	263	As they have not been out of work for over 12 months, they have been told they should not apply.  If we are to make a genuine and serious attempt to get people back to work, we should reduce the relevant timeframe to six months.

I understood that the legislation introduced after the bank guarantee provided that the guarantee would end on 29 September 2010.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether the extension of the bank guarantee scheme and the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme to the end of December of this year will require legislation or a ministerial order to be brought before this House?  If a minimum of €200 billion of debt is to be guaranteed for a further five years——

On that occasion, the Taoiseach consciously decided not to answer it.  We would like to know whether legislation will be required in the Dáil in respect of the covered institutions financial support scheme.

Since then, the IMF has suggested that national governments should take some initiatives to assist home owners who find themselves in negative equity, in arrears with their mortgages and possibly unemployed.  In the meantime, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has made a reference to robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Can I finish my question on promised legislation?  Can I ask the Taoiseach if the Government intends to proceed with the legislation that was promised to the House in November 2009, during the debate on NAMA?  In that context, will those who are engaged in discussions with the lending institutions remember that the issue relates to compound interest being charged on arrears of instalments?

My other question relates to promised legislation as well.  Deputies on this side of the House have repeatedly raised what has now been described by a representative of the Garda as a breakdown in law and order.  In that context, can I ask the Taoiseach if any effort will be made to enforce the legislation that has already been passed by this House or to introduce the bail (amendment) Bill that has been promised?  I ask the Taoiseach to have particular regard to the fact that it has been clearly indicated that people who are on bail are openly involved in serious crime throughout the country.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	318	It is not a question of a problem — it is a question of logistics.

If he raises it on the Adjournment, we will consider it sympathetically.  He could also ask a parliamentary question on the matter.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The Taoiseach will agree that Deputies on this side of the House have been very responsible in not seeking to make political capital out of the extent of gun murders in recent years, compared to the conduct of Fianna Fáil when in Opposition. The two assassinations of last evening showed that this is out of control.  Has the Taoiseach any special measure in mind to deal with the situation?My second matter is one I have raised with the Taoiseach previously.  It is the number of abandoned horses, particularly in County Dublin but also in other counties, and the manner in which they are being abused or left starving and, in some cases, dead.  People concerned with animal welfare tell me the local authorities cannot deal with the problem because they cannot get the necessary assistance from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  What can the Taoiseach do on this matter?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	334	That matter is not appropriate on the Order of Business, and no one knows that better than yourself, Deputy Rabbitte.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	335	It is a massive problem.  They are left rotting in the field.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	336	With regard to the first matter, we all deplore these killings.  They show a callous disregard for human life.  The fact that a young person was injured in last night's shooting is also appalling.  The Garda is carrying out intensive investigations of these and all such killings and they will devote all necessary resources to the investigations.  Gardaí face severe challenges in dealing with gangland murders.  Often, they receive no co-operation.  In some cases, persons whom the Garda identified as being at risk, rather than co-operate, seek to thwart the Garda so they can get on with their activities.  Despite that, a number of people are before the courts in connection with the recent gangland killings and some important legislation has been passed, particularly the surveillance legislation.  The Defence Forces and the Garda can use surveillance mechanisms, in some case, to overcome the problem of persuading witnesses to come forward.  Many legislative changes have been brought forward.  On every occasion the Garda sought extra support it has been provided by the Government and debated in this House.  We must continue to be vigilant with regard to this matter.  The legislation enacted has helped the Garda in its efforts to protect law abiding citizens from these horrible happenings.  Everyone shares the Deputy's concern and appreciates the need for us to continue to work with the Garda.  It has had some successes in this area.The other issue the Deputy raised is the responsibility of local authorities.  There are also non-governmental organisations, such as the DSPCA, which provide help.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	337	They cannot cope with the numbers.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	341	While the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was bounding around the country after stags, one of his Department's agents placed an advertisement in today's  Irish Independent  that is 25 months out of date.  Even the telephone number is out of date.  The environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is promised.  Who will pick up the bill for an advertisement that is 25 months out of date?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should keep an eye on this matter, instead of running around with his hare-brained ideas.  When will be see the promised legislation? 
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	342	That legislation will be published later this year.

Will the Taoiseach inform the House of the circumstances of this latest incident, in view of the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is out of the country.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The matter is being investigated.  I cannot bring further details to the House at this point.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill is on the list of promised legislation.  Repite care services are being  affected by cutbacks in funding.  The Taoiseach was in Limerick yesterday and he spoke with people who are affected by the cuts.  In counties Clare and Limerick, 63 families are affected.  Can the Taoiseach convey some good news to them of a Government commitment to restore their funding?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Deputy Carey, it is not appropriate to raise that matter on the Order of Business.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The Taoiseach did not answer Deputy Rabbitte's question as to when the animal welfare Bill would come before the House.  The Taoiseach attended a European Council meeting two weeks ago.  When does he intend to debate the issues dealt with there,  considering that he signed a ten year agreement relating to strategy and policies for this country?  It is reasonable to expect that the normal practice would be followed and that the House would have the opportunity to debate the conclusions of the European Council meeting.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I accommodated a request that we debate the Saville inquiry instead.  It took the slot which would normally be given to the European Council meeting.  We will have many opportunities to discuss economic employment policy in the European context, including the European 2020 document, which has been passed.There is no date for the animal welfare Bill, but we look forward to hearing the Deputy's contribution.

In recent years we have seen the gradual erosion of the rights and entitlements of people living in rural areas.  For example, one can no longer cut turf, smoke or drink.  One cannot drain land because all land must be a natural flood plain which eventually will rise and lift boats.  One cannot build in rural areas.  One is discouraged from building there because it is bad for society, and in general.  One cannot shoot.  If one applies for a gun licence, one must get a character reference from a reputable person who is not a member of the Garda Síochána — an extraordinary situation.One cannot keep dogs.  One cannot hunt.  One cannot fish for eel.  There is an extraordinary point related to that which greatly troubles me.  When the European Commission issued a directive to the effect that individual member states should introduce conservation measures for the protection of eels, every other European country did just that.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs repeatedly tried to encourage the relevant Minister, the colleague of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to bring the measure before both Houses and the committee before he made a decision but the Minister treated the committee with contempt and refused point blank to have anything to do with it or to listen to members' views.  He went ahead and banned eel fishing throughout the country, arbitrarily and in a fashion I shall leave to Members to describe.

Times will change as time passes but at this moment what worries me most is that this is an illustration of what happens when a small group of people within Government seize power and their bigger brothers in Government do nothing to arrest their progress.  They then decide to hold society to ransom.  This is what is happening.  It is grossly unfair and, without a shadow of doubt, it is undemocratic.  Ordinarily, I would not be so exercised by this but I strongly oppose the attempt by this Government in this legislation to do what it proposes.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I shall take a few seconds to register my opposition to this Bill and my support for the Ward Union Hunt and hunts in general.  I have spent all my life living beside the Meath Hunt and have watched it in operation.  I watched how its members treat their dogs and run their business.  I do not get a chance to follow or watch the Ward Union Hunt and its business but I know many of the people involved.  They treat animals and operate in exactly the same way as the Meath Hunt.  They have respect for animals and know what they are doing.  They care for them and everything is done under proper conditions.  From monitoring the hunt, I am glad to say it has reacted to urban living.  It has made adjustments to how it does its business.This is a misguided attempt to end something that is part of rural life.  It is an attack on rural Ireland and is causing an unnecessary divide between rural and urban dwellers.  The Minister is putting the fear of God into people who just want to be left alone to go about their business as they always have done, whether stag hunting, fox hunting, fishing, shooting or whatever interests them.  Most people believe this is only the start and that the Minister fully intends to go further.  He already has another wildlife Bill on the way in some months and God knows what will be added in that.  It is unfair and wrong and is an abuse of power——

In his address the Minister referred to domestic deer.  If he were really serious about wildlife, in which I am as interested as he is, he would take steps to eliminate the escaped mink that are destroying every aspect of wildlife throughout the country.  The poor old deer never destroyed anything but I do not know why the Minister wants to protect them to the exclusion of protecting other species of wildlife which are being destroyed throughout the country.In the past week or two, I have become suspicious about the mad rush and anxiety of the minor party in Government to get its Bills passed, including this one, and those on development and dog breeding.  I warn Deputies this is a sign of an election.  This party wants to clear the air and have its slate clean, having got its policies through even though Fianna Fáil is lying back, doing nothing.I am not one bit impressed by the two Independent Deputies who today declared they would vote against this Bill.  They made that declaration when they knew other Independents were supporting it and there was no chance of it being defeated.  That is hypocrisy of the highest order.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I speak as a Deputy who is deeply in touch with rural issues and a rural way of life and I strongly oppose the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010, as proposed by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  Some of his amendments have actually added to the complexity.  It will be a lawyers' paradise.The Bill before the House is historic in at least one respect, in that, to the best of my knowledge, it is the first occasion since the foundation of the State that a Government has brought a specific Bill before this House to outlaw a country sport.  This is not a good day for rural Ireland.  I respect the views of the many people who contact me to express their different views.  That is part of the democratic participatory process but I do not bow to people in an orchestrated campaign.  I will not be bullied, harassed or intimidated by extraterritorial e-mails and so on from outside the jurisdiction.  I am well able to make up my own mind.This is a misguided Bill, in any event.  Deputy English stated clearly there was no issue of welfare because of the detailed supervision of the Ward Union Hunt.  This arose from the licensing regime which was put in place by my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  That was our policy at the time and it remains such.  We will not allow the Green Party or any small segment of a party to misrepresent our policy here or anywhere else.  Name-calling and vulgar abuse is what one is reduced to when one is on the losing side.  We do not call anybody Father Ted but we could call an odd person Father Jack.That is where the welfare issue lies.  It is clear in any event that were there any such issue it could be addressed by means of the licensing conditions.  No such issue arises.  From an interview I heard the Minister give on radio last week it was clear he suffered a defeat in the High Court, in a judicial review.  If people feel aggrieved by any matter they are entitled to bring it for review.  That is why the courts are there and I laud the openness of the courts to deal with issues.  The Minister said he had not gone away but that court determined the licensing conditions he had imposed were crazy, in any event.  Now he is back with this blunt legislative instrument which illustrates a vengeful streak.  That is what this amounts to and arises from the Minister not getting his own way in December 2007.  If he felt there was an issue that needed to be addressed, why did he not consult with the key stakeholders in order to ensure the best approach was pursued?  There is plenty of precedent for that.  He sent his officials.  I heard people on the radio say that the Minister was supposed to talk to them but I understand he did not do so.  The Minister can say whether he did so.When all else fails and the Minister's argument does not stand up, he resorts to vulgar abuse and misinterpretation of the Labour Party policy.  I will not allow him to do that for his own narrow gains, just because he is in a corner.  He referred to such people as the "tally ho" brigade.  Many people involved in hunting or country pursuits are like me.  They were born in cottages in the heart of rural Ireland, with no land, no horses or hounds, no silver spoons, only a grá for country sports and the rural way of life.  As young people we hunted rabbits in order to secure food or sell it at two shillings unskinned or half a crown skinned.  That was what we had to do.  We hunted foxes because of the damage they did to farmers when they raided hen houses throughout the country and picked out and killed lambs.  This was lauded and actively encouraged by the county committees of agriculture.  One got half a crown for a fox's tail when one brought it in.  That was another way we had to raise income.  The Minister knows nothing about rural Ireland and nothing about the rural way of life.This is a serious issue in rural areas, and the real target of those promoting this Bill is not the Ward Union Hunt, but other countryside activities and pursuits.  The Minister should look at his own party's welfare policy, which states:The Green Party does not promote or support the live export of animals ...  The Green Party campaigns for an end to intensive rearing of cattle, sheep and poultry . . .  The party campaigns for an end to the use of wild animals in circuses . . .  When in government, the Green Party will introduce to end blood sports, with heavy penalties for organisations and participants . . .  The party does not support or promote traditional zoos in the longer term and will continue to work towards a complete reformation.Does the Minister want to get rid of us altogether?  Will he take our blood and get rid of us altogether?This Bill will hang around the Minister's neck for a long time to come.  Rural people will not forget.  This is the thin edge of the wedge.  I have heard from people representing him that the Minister wants to get rid of coursing proposals implemented by a previous Minister, which were excellent.  The Green Party was not satisfied and wanted to get rid of them.  We say "No" to this today.

I have participated in four coalition Governments, and many others in this Chamber have done so as well.  When a party goes into a coalition, it signs up to a programme for Government and it sticks with it because that is its signature on the document.  I remember being with the Labour Party in Government and I worked well with Deputy Quinn when he was Minister.  There is give and take when a party is in a coaltion, and there is no point in saying otherwise.We have all been receiving e-mails from RISE!, or Rural Ireland Says Enough!.  I am here today because I come from a part of Ireland which fishes, hunts and shoots.  I came with a mandate from there and they want me to say today that they understand if we signed up to a document, but that they will not entertain — nor will I nor will Fianna Fáil — any further inroads into rural pursuits.

I want to know exactly what could possibly be wrong with fishing, hunting or with the gun clubs whose members have approached me.  They go about their normal pursuits as well.While we recognise that we must stick with the programme for Government if we signed up to it, I do not know if there is any way the Minister can assuage those of us in the backbenches who do not believe that if he gets this under his belt he will be free to roam again among the hedgregrows, the fishing loughs and the streams where harmless pursuits are carried out.  We believe in those harmless pursuits — as well as other pursuits which might not be as harmless — and the Minister will have to give a guarantee on the floor of the House that this Bill and the Bill to be taken next week — which he inherited from the former Minister, Deputy Dick Roche — will be the end of his ramblings in rural Ireland.

From a quick read of the Hansard report of the debate, Members should note that the following arguments were used.  It was stated at that time that this was a traditional rural pastime, that it was a trivial Bill, that the bears subject to the baiting were well cared for and that it would lead to a ban on hunting, shooting and fishing.  Some 180 years on we can see that exactly the same arguments are being dusted down and taken off the shelf in the debate on stag hunting——

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	461	This Bill repeals section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976.  When that legislation was discussed in this House in 1975, the then Minister for Lands, Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick, made the case for that section as being very much about wildlife conservation.  It meant the Minister and his Department had control over the hunting of stags and other wildlife covered by the section.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins made the point that it is a funny way of going about legislation, removing the Minister's own right to licence and control a particular activity.Is the Minister opening up loopholes?  That is why he introduced the other provisions of the Bill that he must now amend for the hunting of deer generally.  The Minister would have been better to have retained his power to licence this activity because he would have had control and could have issued licences according to the provisions introduced when Deputy Higgins was Minister, where he looked after the conservation of the deer, their safety, health and welfare, making sure they were not killed and that dogs did not get too near them, and regulating the type of vehicle they were transported in.  The Minister is giving up a power that was introduced to conserve animals.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	464	Section 1 relates to definitions and only those can be discussed.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	467	This section allows the Minister to repeal section 26 of the Wildlife Act 1976.  The fact we have that Act, and an amendment to it in 2000, is a clear indication that there was some concern about the activities involving animals.  Regulations and monitoring were put in place and they have stood the test of time.  The Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Agriculture, Forestry and Food, and all those who wanted to inspect the activities related to stag hunting, were able to do so under proper supervision.I cannot see why the Minister wants to amend the section of the principal Act to remove his power to grant a licence authorising the hunting of deer.  That is the fundamental issue associated with the legislation and the Minister still has the opportunity to bring forward additional regulations if he feels it appropriate rather than an outright ban on stag hunting.  In his zealousness to pursue a narrow agenda, making the Government uncomfortable and giving rise to instability in the Government, the Minister is acting in a completely irresponsible manner by proceeding along this road and implementing legislation that is clearly out of sync with rural Ireland.  The vast majority of Government Deputies have to be hounded in here tonight by the Whips to ensure the Government's survival.  That is not the way to build trust between Government partners.The Minister should introduce additional amendments to allay the fears of his Fianna Fáil partners who spoke against the Bill but then voted for it on Second Stage.  There will be another vote at 7 p.m. and they will have another opportunity to say whether they agree with the contents of this and other sections.  I ask the Minister to be reasonable to those people who have asked him to be genuine and to look at additional regulations instead of an outright ban on stag hunting.I look forward to his reply that will reflect the views of his colleagues in Government who have put themselves on the line in their constituencies for the Minister and this legislation which he insisted on putting in the revised programme for Government so he could get approval for fiscal parameters to be pursued in the budgetary process in 2010 and for his support for the ill-conceived NAMA legislation.  That, however, is no surprise because the Minister was asleep when the bank guarantee scheme was being agreed.A sense of priority is required about the Minister's actions, which have brought about mistrust because of his insistence on narrow legislation being passed this week and next week, legislation that should not be a priority for any Government when we face such serious economic and social difficulties.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Giving up the power to licence an activity is a strange way to go about dealing with that activity.  The original Act had the conservation of wildlife as its stated purpose.  The Minister's approach is very divisive, with an all-out ban of an activity that has gone on for 150 years.The Minister has also failed to address ancillary activities, such as the fallen animals service provided by the Ward Union Hunt.  What will happen to the herd of deer that belongs to the Ward Union Hunt?  It is an ecosystem in itself; it is a herd and surely the Minister would want to protect it.This has been a divisive discussion.  The Minister does not recognise, because the Green Party is so small perhaps, that there are different views on this issue, with people on either side of the argument and people in the middle.  That was always the case, and across the political spectrum that is the reality.  That is why the Green Party has turned its guns on the Labour Party, because it was not sure it could bring its Government partners along with it.  The Labour Party is a broad church with mixed views on the issue and we have tried to accommodate them.  That is how society functions and it is the approach Deputy Michael D. Higgins took when he was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, speaking to all sides, monitoring and inspecting the hunt, and introducing a strict licensing regime.  Progress was made as a result and all sides came on board.There are no principles involved in this.  It is not my principle to ban stag hunting or the Ward Union Hunt; my principles are about free education and similar issues.  People were shot in my constituency today and that is where the gardaí should be focusing their attention, not on an issue like this, where there is all sorts of regulation.  That is not our priority and it should not be the priority for the Government right now.

It is so narrow we should not be spending more than two or three hours on it.  Instead, this is the highlight of the year in the Oireachtas.

Perhaps they do not understand that while the Green Party negotiated a programme for Government on issues of principle, we are also pragmatic enough to know that we did not get some things and we have to put up with that.

It will either release the deer earlier and bring it back to captivity without being stressed by a pack of hounds and then have the scent, the horse riding and the industry or it will learn to drag.  It will not collapse the industry because it cannot have the hounds baying at the stag.  I would bet money on that.  If it wants to cut off its nose to spite its face then it is very stupid.  RISE! is very clever because it turned this debate into a rural versus urban divide.  As someone with rural blood roaring through my veins it is not a rural versus urban divide.  Rural people oppose the wanton cruelty of animals just as urban people do.In 2007, Deputy Gilmore put pressure on the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to enact legislation but that has changed now, because the pollsters state that perhaps a handful of people might vote for the Labour Party as it is doing well in the polls.  That is the difference between a small party and a large party.  As a small party, we are not beholden to anyone.  We try to work for the people and for our principles.

I assure him that is not the case.  However, his party has no concept of what rural Ireland is like, its traditions or the value to the local economy of various aspects of rural life, including hunting, coursing, fishing and shooting.  They are big part of rural Ireland and a big part of what we are.  They are very beneficial to the economy of rural Ireland.

They spoke on Committee Stage against it but voted for it.  As far as I am concerned, they are a bunch of hypocrites.

He is concerned about the trust that exists between the Government parties.  I would have thought he would have welcomed destabilisation in government but I can tell him that we have a renewed programme for government, which will go through.  As far as I am concerned, as Minister my job is to deliver on the renewed programme for Government and I intend to do that in a timely fashion.  The Deputy is correct to state we have a legislative programme in the run up to the summer months, including the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010, the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 and the local government (Dublin mayor and regional authority) Bill.  All of these will go through.  There is also the climate change Bill.I do not understand Deputy Tuffy's line of argument.  She stated I would deprive myself of power to regulate but it does not apply because what this does is ensure that this activity will not take place.  Deputy Tuffy's argument does not apply.  I would have thought that was absolutely clear.  She also spoke about different points of view and democracy.  Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority of people do not want this type of activity to continue.  Most people find it distasteful to see an animal in distress, particularly a domesticated animal.Social issues arise, and Deputy Tuffy's party is aware of this.  Divorce was a very divisive issue but the Labour Party saw fit to push it through.  It had my support in the House because I thought it was a necessary measure.  I took the view that it was an extremely important issue and set aside party politics.  However, the Labour Party does not see fit to do so now because it sees an opportunity.  What it is doing this evening is extremely opportunistic and cynical.  Individuals in the Labour Party have clearly and unequivocally stated they oppose bloodsports.  It was encouraging to see that Deputy Broughan did not turn up for the vote on Second Stage.  I know of his personal conviction.  We shall see whether he turns up later but I doubt it.  I applaud that.Deputy Tuffy questioned why we are spending time on this.  This afternoon, her party and Fine Gael objected to the guillotining of this legislation.  As far as we are concerned, this Bill consists of a number of paragraphs and we should not waste valuable Dáil time.

We want to get through the legislation as quickly as possible.Section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act allows the Minister to grant a licence to the master of a pack of stag hounds, authorising the hunting of deer by that pack.  This section is being repealed.  The reference to section 35 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 relates to the repeal of section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 which allowed the Minister at the time to grant a licence to the master of a pack of stag hounds authorising the hunting of otters by that pack.  Otters are protected by the Wildlife Act and the habitats directive and are considered a priority species.  That is simply what this section is doing.  It is absolutely crystal clear and there should be no argument about it.

For example, we agree that third level tuition fees should not be reintroduced.  We have strongly supported some the changes it has made regarding planning.  We support the Government's initiatives on civil partnership.  The problem with this Bill is that there are different views.  For example, studies carried out on the Ward Union Hunt found evidence of physiological recovery within three or four days and full recovery within ten days, and two months post hunt the hunted deer were found to be in good health.  If one starts bringing the issue of animal cruelty into the debate one could talk about horse racing or many other activities on which people would have a point of view.We live in a society where we have to bring people on board, in terms of animal protection.  We need to decide on the best way to proceed.  I have a difficulty with this Bill.  The Minister is getting rid of the power to licence the activity.  The Minister feared that he might drive this into hunting and shooting deer under the Firearms Act and that is why he brought in the provision which has concerned deer stalkers.  He was trying to close off loopholes.  He is now trying to fix the mess that he created by trying to close loopholes and he may well end up opening another loophole.What the Minister might allow is unregulated hunting and shooting of deer, which is not deer stalking.  He is not licensing such activity in the way he is licensing the Ward Union Hunt.  The problem is that because the Minister was not prepared to engage and talk to the Ward Union Hunt and Wild Deer Ireland in a genuine way and consult with Coillte, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, different sectors of society and the parties here, he is creating a Bill which may contain loopholes which the Minister will then try to close.  There was a provision in section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 whereby the activity could be controlled by licensing.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I move amendment No a1:In page 3, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:"(2) A permission may not be granted under section 42 of this Act to enable the hunting of female deer between 1 May and 30 September in any year.".This amendment provides that permission for culling female deer between 1 May and September will not be granted under section 42.  We tabled this amendment because Wild Deer Ireland raised this issue with the Minister.  Its concern is that the Minister is currently issuing licences to land owners under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to cull female deer from May to September at a time when female deer give birth to fawns.  If a female deer that has fawns is shot the fawns will be orphaned and will suffer a horrible death because they will have no mother to look after them and will starve to death.If we had stakeholder involvement this could have been the type of issue the Minister could have addressed in terms of the conservation of wildlife and protection of deer.  Everybody accepts the need to cull deer and that deer stalking is an acceptable activity but it must be done in a humane way which does not cause suffering.  We tabled this amendment because it is appropriate to the issue of the protection of deer and wildlife.  Would the Minister consider accepting this amendment or will he deal with the issue in another way?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	513	We are dealing with amendments Nos. a1, 1 and 1a  together.  I stated on Second Stage that I would table an amendment to section 3 to allay the fears of licensed deer stalkers who have a licence from my Department under section 29 that might inadvertently affect their legitimate hunting practices.  It is not unusual for a deer stalker to bring a dog while out hunting deer.  This is especially the case in woodlands where a dog would be used to retrieve fallen game which can sometimes be concealed in the undergrowth.In cases where several hunters were stalking deer on a property and each had a dog or if they were bringing two dogs for training purposes it could be construed that they were breaking the law based on the original wording of section 3.  It was never my intention that the Bill should place any restriction on lawful deer stalking.  Accordingly, the amendment I tabled states that it would not be an offence for people with a deer licence under section 29 of the Wildlife Act who stalk deer on foot or those with permission under section 42 to have two or more dogs.The normal annual licence is issued under section 29 to deer hunters.  More than 4,000 such licences were issued by my Department for the 2009-10 hunting season.  The open season for most deer species extends from 1 September to the end of February.  However, there is a 12 month hunting season for munchak deer as it is considered an invasive species which can cause much damage if allowed to spread.Section 42 permission is issued outside the open season and offers a facility whereby a person can obtain permission on a case by case basis to take action against a protected species, including deer, which can include the scaring, capturing or killing of said species in a situation where serious damage is being caused to agricultural crops, forestry plantations or other fauna.  It is considered that there may be occasions when it is necessary or useful to bring dogs to assist in moving deer from areas where they are causing serious damage, for example, in young forestry plantations.  I am satisfied that this amendment to section 3 will address the fears expressed by licensed deer hunters.On the amendment tabled by Deputy Tuffy, applications made to my Department for section 42 permission are considered on a case by case basis.  I have the powers under the Wildlife Acts to include conditions in the permission which can prohibit culling of female deer during a certain period.  I have included such conditions in quite a number of the section 42 permissions issued in recent months.  Accordingly I consider that the inclusion of this provision in the Bill is not necessary.On amendment No. 1a , also tabled by Deputy Tuffy, I have already informed the House of the proposed amendment to this part of the Bill allowing licensed deer stalkers on foot to hunt deer with two or more dogs.  As it is sometimes the case that a person granted a section 42 permission may also require the use of two or more dogs I will not accept this amendment.

Perhaps he was being chased by constituents in Kerry South who were unhappy about particular matters but they certainly had nothing to do with deer.  The Minister needs a sense of proportion.  He is trying to solve what he believes to be a problem with a sledge-hammer.  We already have restrictions, monitoring and licensing arrangements.  The Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food continuously monitor these activities but he is not happy.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	553	The Minister indicated that he will consider the Labour Party amendment on culling female deer between May and September in the context of the licensing regime.  When the possibility that section 3 may prohibit deer stalking or culling was raised with the Minister and his officials, he stated that was not his intention.  I understand that his officials were to revert to the Wild Deer Association of Ireland with an amendment which would address the issue but this meeting never happened.  The Wild Deer Association of Ireland is not completely satisfied with the Minister's amendment.  He is prohibiting an activity and then introducing an amendment to make an exception to this prohibition.  In effect, he is creating a mess he will have to clean up by means of an amendment.When I first read section 3 I wondered what it was doing in the Bill given that it has nothing to do with the Ward Union Hunt.  The only reason I can see for its inclusion was to prevent a loophole being used after he banned the hunt.  He was afraid that people would use the licensing provisions under section 29 to hunt deer on horseback with hounds.  In this case, however, they do so without licences and can shoot the deer.  He is now trying to row back on the section to allow deer culling.  However, will his amendment simply reopen the loophole he is attempting to close?  He may be driving this activity in the direction where it will not be licensed or regulated.  I do not think anybody, including the Ward Union Hunt, wants that.  If he did not intend to prohibit deer stalking or culling, why did he include section 3 in the Bill?

It is a question of whether animals have the right to enjoy a relatively stress-free life.  On that question, Deputy Tuffy suggested that a recovery period of three or four days is, somehow, an excuse to allow a domesticated deer to be taken off a cart and chased around the countryside by baying hounds, thereby causing risk to the public and, as the Irish Council Against Blood Sports reveals in the videos which are available to watch on YouTube, bloodshed in some instances.  In this context, a three or four day recovery period is quite patronising to the animal.  How many of us have owned dogs?  How would Deputy Tuffy like it if I chased her pet beagle around the road or gave it a good kick up the rear end and scared the living bejasus out of it?  What if I then told her that her animal would recover in a few days but that I got a great laugh out of it and sure is that not sport?  I was hunting the animal and giving vent to my masculine, testosterone fuelled instincts.  Normally, I leave this on the GAA pitch.  My claim to fame in that respect is that I am probably the only person in Ireland who got into a fistfight with a member of his own team.  That is another story.

If people want to have the thrill of the hunt, they can have hounds chase a scent either by releasing the deer or dragging the scent before the hunt.To return to Deputy Tuffy's remarks, the Minister clearly indicated that if requests are made on a case by case basis, permission could be granted in the case of a certain breed of deer that needed to be culled throughout the year.  It will not be permissible to cull female deer of other species during the season in which fawns would be at risk of being orphaned.  The Minister will have the power to oversee this matter and he and, no doubt, his successors will take full cognisance of these responsibilities.  While the Deputy's amendment is a welcome attempt to produce constructive legislation, as the Minister stated, it falls short at the final hurdle.I will reluctantly address Deputy Hogan's accusation that the Minister is afraid to deal with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Amendment) Bill.  As has been stated on countless occasions, it was the Minister who established the investigations into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  He had the balls to ask the wife of one of his greatest political adversaries, an independent, strong-minded and qualified individual, to deal with this issue without fear or favour.  The Minister does not speak from both sides of his mouth.

Green Party Deputies have had to do this on other issues.  There are many on the Fine Gael Party benches who are on record as strongly opposing blood sports.  Tonight, they will shamefully line up and vote against forward looking legislation.  They will be pragmatic, listen to the instructions of their party Whip and vote in a manner they do not like.  That is the nature of politics.  I would like to have free votes on many issues but unfortunately that is not the case.  For some reason, this legislation scares people.

I can play fantasy politics as much as anyone else.The Minister tabled amendments in response to genuine concerns.  Who will blame a Minister for proposing amendments during Committee and Report Stage debates?  This has been always the case and has been done with financial legislation, civil rights Bills and other legislation.  There is nothing sinister or incompetent about finding and addressing loopholes in legislation.  There is no reason not to support the Bill on the basis of the amendments as they do nothing more than close loopholes.

As Deputy Hogan noted, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, is fortunate he was not killed some years ago when his car burst into flames after hitting a deer.  If a car collides with a deer on a public roadway in Killarney National Park, the Department is not liable to pay compensation.  How many deer have been killed in road traffic accidents in recent years?We heard about the achievements of the programme for Government.  A sum of €70,000 has been provided to count frogs, while a further €60,000 has been allocated to study a certain type of bat.Deputy Gogarty alluded to job creation.  If this Bill is passed, hundreds of jobs will be lost.  The only jobs the leader of the Green Party has created were junior ministerial positions for his party colleagues.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	587	It would be as well to recognise that we have an international obligation in the area of biodiversity.  However, let us deal with that issue when we have an opportunity to do so.  The legislation before us has a narrow focus as it deals with a specific activity.  It is an anachronism in this day and age that the activity in question continues to take place.  In addition to the animal welfare issue that arises, there is an inconsistency in terms of the use of a domesticated animal in this activity.  While a stag has some wild tendencies, it is a domesticated animal and we would not tolerate the hunting of any other type of domesticated animal, for instance, a cow or pig.  Stag hunting is an anachronism.I accept that the public safety aspect of the Bill, a collision with a stag, is less likely to arise than a head-on collision with another car caused by someone falling asleep at the wheel.  However, if a vehicle were to collide with a stag and someone were to be killed, would the Deputies Opposite remain quiet or would they ask which Minister licensed the activity and thereby allowed a tragedy to befall a family?  Would they be sanguine about the Minister's role in allowing this licensing activity to continue and failing to notice previous near misses, including, but not only, the incident in Kildalkey?  In December, for example, a deer had to be put down having collided with a vehicle.  Fortunately, the incident did not result in a human tragedy.At the weekend, I was walking along a quiet laneway in Garristown in the company of several people who pointed out the exact location at which a stag emerged from across a ditch onto the laneway in front of them.  If the incident had occurred a couple of minutes later in the presence of children——

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The wording of the motion I have moved deserves to be emphasised, particularly the section in which we call on the Government to establish a patient safety authority to ensure "investigations take place when and where" necessary.  As things stand, such an authority is not being established, unfortunately.We are having this debate on foot of another serious scandal — the misdiagnosis of miscarriage in pregnant women, which is mentioned in the motion.  This problem has emanated from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which has been beset by difficulties and scandals over the years.  In recent times, the serious pressure on the hospital has become even more horrendous as a result of the Government's deliberate policy of stripping essential services from hospitals in the surrounding counties and moving them to Drogheda.  This approach is making it more difficult for the staff of the hospital, who have an increased workload, to carry out their duties with any degree of safety.I wish to give an example of the problems encountered during foetal assessments.  A lady told me that the person who performed the ultrasound on her was bleeped on three separate occasions during the course of the short examination.  Anybody who knows anything about learning knows that concentration is important.  We all know that anxiety interferes with concentration.  If a bleep goes off in one's pocket, it is not just distracting — it creates anxiety too.  One will be distracted while one performs this important examination if one is aware that somebody is in great trouble and needs one's services.It is important to remind the House what happened to Melissa Redmond.  Eight weeks into her pregnancy, on 22 July 2009, Melissa Redmond went for a scan in the early pregnancy unit of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  It should have been an occasion of joy and hope, but instead it was a devastating experience.  She was advised that her unborn baby was dead, eight weeks into her pregnancy.  A dilation and curettage procedure was arranged for two days later, on 24 July 2009, and she was given an abortive drug to take on the morning of the operation.  The drug in question is designed to open the neck of the womb to make the procedure easier.  We must bear in mind that a dilation and curettage procedure involves the evacuation of the contents of the womb.  If there is a live foetus in the womb, its life will be terminated as part of the procedure.  A report on TV3 last night referred to an extraordinary case in which a probable twin survived a dilation and curettage procedure.  That is highly unusual.Fortunately, Melissa Redmond had sufficient strength of character to seek a second opinion.  In that context, I will speak later about the gross unfairness in our system.  As she had already had two children and suffered four miscarriages, she was not prepared to allow matters to rest there. She went to her general practitioner in Donabate, who gave her another scan, which found that the baby was alive.  The baby was born healthy, thankfully, and is now alive and well.  I am sure the Redmonds would have nothing but good to say about the staff who looked after Melissa for the rest of her pregnancy, subsequent to events at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.After the story broke, the HSE said the wrong diagnosis of miscarriage, such as that in this case at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, was "extremely rare".  This was contradicted by women who came forward with similar experiences over the following days.  To date, approximately a dozen women have told stories of wrongly being informed by maternity hospitals that their babies had been miscarried, only to give birth to healthy infants at a later stage.  The HSE has received almost 300 telephone calls from concerned women and their families about the treatment they received in maternity hospitals throughout the country.It is important to remind the House that when different people make the same mistake in different locations, there is a problem with the system.  If the same person makes the same mistake, clearly there is a problem with the person.  Nobody should doubt not only that we have a problem with our system, but also that we have a problem with who runs the system.  This problem was not addressed immediately to ascertain its prevalence.  We had to depend on brave and strong people like Melissa and Michael Redmond, who were prepared to forego their privacy and to let the country know, through the media, what happened to them.  This resulted in other women coming forward with their stories.Although we realise we have a problem that requires investigation, the Minister for Health and Children will not order an independent investigation.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, wants the HSE to investigate the HSE.  She has been a stalwart proponent of not allowing the medical profession to investigate the medical profession, or the dental profession to investigate the dental profession.  I agree with her that the days when any profession or group — the Garda or other body — was allowed to investigate itself are over.  We need third party verification.  We need to be assured that those conducting investigations do not have any conflict of interest.There have been other cases of misdiagnosis.  Martha O'Neill Brennan from Galway told her story.In both these cases, the women trusted their instincts, stood up to the system and insisted on a second scan.  Both are right and both have since given birth to healthy babies.  Michael and Melissa Redmond have since said they were disgusted by the HSE's reaction to the misdiagnosis.An internal review showed that the equipment was faulty and the facilities inadequate.  The inquiry found that the image resolution on the ultrasound machine in the early pregnancy assessment unit was not adequate to accurately assess early pregnancies and their complications and that the machine displayed evidence of fatigue.  The internal review recommended that the equipment be updated to ensure it was fit for purpose.  Despite this, the scanner continued to be used until January 2010, six months after the incident.  The review also suggested that a dedicated ultrasonographer be recruited to the unit.  One year on, that position has still not been filled.  What is the recommendation from this, so called,  independent HSE report?  It is that we get a sonographer for four hours a day.  This maternity unit delivered more than 4,000 babies last year.  By any international standard, having spoken to professionals in this area, there should be at least two, if not four, whole-time equivalent sonographers available and not the proposed half-time equivalent, who still is not present.This puts me in mind of the self serving system the HSE has become.  It looks to itself and its own convenience before it looks to patient care.I congratulate the Redmond family of Donabate and others who have come forward with their experiences.  It is not fair to expect devastated couples, who have just been told they have lost their unborn child, to have the composure, confidence and courage to demand a second opinion.  It should happen as a right.  A patient centred service would listen and ask.  Our service thinks only of the inconvenience to itself, as encapsulated by another woman who told of asking, when she was on her way to have a D and C, for a second scan.  She was told that was not possible.  When she continued to insist she was further informed that not alone was it not possible but that if she did not stop insisting she would miss her slot in the queue and would not have her D and C for another week.  Is this a demonstration of compassion, of caring or of a patient centred service?  The ethos of the HSE has become something horrible and not something of which anyone in this Chamber can be proud.  I can give example after example of that.Meanwhile, the HSE has announced it is developing national guidelines for clinical practice in obstetrics care.  It has announced the establishment of a miscarriage diagnosis review to examine the cases known or identified in the past five years.  The review has subsequently expanded to cases beyond five years.  While we recognise and welcome the decision of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland to develop its own guidelines in conjunction with the HSE so that it will standardise practices at a high level and welcome the announcement of the HSE review, this is not enough.The Minister for Health and Children and the HSE must call on HIQA to conduct an urgent audit of ante-natal and maternity services, including the standard and safety of equipment, staff workloads and the workload on equipment, care protocols and training of personnel.  This is critical.  I am given to understand there are not many more than 120 ultrasound machines involved in foetal assessment.  How long could it take to assess those?  A year after this matter arose privately between the hospital and Melissa Redmond — the HSE was aware of it — this has not happened.  The lethargic, lazy approach of the HSE to these issues, which are so important to patient care, is not acceptable.  Matters are put on the long finger and patients are left at risk, instead of urgent action being taken as would happen in a proper patient centred service rather than the self service system we have.We call on the Government to establish a dedicated independent patient safety authority that would incorporate HIQA, reassure patients that they have a safe place to go with their complaint, act as an advocate for them and ensure that investigations take place when and where necessary.Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has had an unfortunate history.  It has been mired in a series of scandals and controversies, many of which centred on the standard of care given to pregnant women.  Given the number of scandals, one would expect the hospital to be extra vigilant when dealing with patient safety and care.  Instead of this, patients attending Drogheda and other hospitals around the country often feel let down and ignored by the system.Do I need to remind Members of what has happened in this hospital and how people in the north east of the country have been let down? I know I do not have to remind my colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.  The disgraced obstetrician Dr. Michael Neary was struck off the medical register in 2003 after an investigation found he had needlessly removed the wombs and ovaries of dozens of expectant mothers.  Garda Sergeant Tania Corcoran-McCabe died, along with one of her twins.  An inquest returned a verdict of death by medical misadventure in relation to the young mother.  I sympathise with her family.  Symphysiotomy procedures were carried out there long after the practice had ceased elsewhere.  Mother Kathleen Naughton, who is still living with the consequences of the symphysiotomy she underwent there 35 years ago, said doctors at the time considered themselves to be "gods".  There was also the terrible case of abuse by Michael Shine. We now know the great work done by Dignity for Patients.Would these groups need to exist if a patient safety authority had been in place?  Would medical people have been allowed to continue with their practices had a patient safety authority existed, which would have been an advocate for complainants and would have been independent and not employed by the hospital?  Complaints officers in the hospitals are employees of the hospital.  Where does their loyalty lie?Thousands of X-rays had to be reviewed after a locum radiologist mistakenly gave the all-clear to nine lung cancer patients, eight of whom subsequently died.  The radiologist worked at Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda and Our Lady's Hospital in Navan between August 2006 and August 2007.  How did the HSE react?  It knew about it.  My colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, through a freedom of information request, established that the HSE knew about this real danger to patients in September 2007 and took no action until May 2008.  This lazy, lethargic approach screamed at patients, "We'll deal with you when we are ready.  In the meantime, you take your chances."I will now refer to Portlaoise and the disgraceful situation where a consultant surgeon, having reviewed the files in fives and sixes, gave them to an official who put them in a room and left them there until a "cohort" was reached.  What was the cohort to be?  Was it 100 or 200?  It did not matter that these women might have had breast cancer — some did.  That was not the issue.  The system would deal with these people when it was good and ready.  That is not the system in which I grew up or was trained.  It is not the system that pertained prior to the installation of the HSE.In Tallaght, a local general practitioner highlighted the X-ray issue in April. The HIQA became involved in June.  It interviewed people in August and in December the Minister was informed.  She was not told the extent of the problem and she did not ask because she did not want to know.  Months went by before the issue was properly addressed.  Once a problem was acknowledged and recognised, all the X-rays — which were digital —  could have been e-mailed to radiologists throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom and the matter could have been resolved within weeks.  Instead, it was left on the long finger because, once again, the system served itself, and the patient was left to wait.  I wish to mention, in particular, the tragedy in Ennis Hospital, where Ann Moriarty twice attended and was given the all-clear.  She also went to St. James's Hospital and was again given the all-clear.The Minister stated last week that HIQA could be the patients' safety authority.  HIQA has told me it cannot be a patient safety advocacy.  However, it could be subsumed into a patient safety authority.  I would like to talk about all the other matters on which it could advise and over which it could preside.  Will we find ourselves here again talking about the plight of our young people with cystic fibrosis who still have no isolation unit? They were promised one would be built this year but it has not yet even been tendered for properly.All the issues I spoke of would have come to light earlier if a patient safety authority were in place.  Consider the situation people must go through in seeking redress for their hurt young, having to mortgage their homes to get justice for their children.  I urge the Minister not to miss this opportunity to instruct HIQA to undertake an investigation and give people back faith in their health service.  They do not trust the HSE and a HSE investigation will not do it for them.  I would like to see an audit of our maternity and ante-natal hospital services performed by HIQA but, most of all, I plead with the Minister to take this opportunity to set up a patient safety authority and restore some faith in our health service.

I live in Drogheda and know hundreds, if not thousands, of the people concerned.  More than 1,500 people work in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital; I probably know most of them and certainly know their families.  They, too, feel deep concern and distress that patients who came into the hospital were failed over the years by Michael Neary, that Tania McCabe died in childbirth, that there were the symphisiotomy and X-Ray issues, and that Michael Shine worked there.  Some of these events occurred when the Medical Missionaries of Mary were in charge of the hospital; others occurred under the HSE.  Many honourable and decent people have worked with both the nuns and the HSE but this issue has never been resolved.To our great regret, the Lourdes Hospital still makes the headlines in appalling incidences such as the recent one involving Melissa Redmond.  I have a constituency member who in August 2008 went through the very same situation, being told after a scan that her baby was dead.  Arrangements were made for a D and C but she insisted on a second opinion and the baby was found to be alive.  At that stage everything was all right but other events happened later and, unfortunately, the baby was not born alive.  Another similar instance arose at least a year earlier.  There was an issue about scanning in the hospital long before this latest case was brought to public attention.  As Deputy Reilly mentioned, we did not know about it and the lady thought her case was unique.The lack of transparency and accountability under the present system is totally unacceptable and immoral.  There is no standard other than, "If you find out at the end of the day then we'll talk about it, then we'll have the inquiry, then we'll try and do something about it".  However, unless there is a patient safety authority to deal with the issue immediately and at all stages, an authority to which people are accountable, which acts for and on behalf of patients, there will not be the health services we all want.Another issue is at stake here, that of transparency and accountability, of freedom of information.  More than six months ago I submitted a freedom of information request to the HSE in regard to an issue.  At this stage it has gone to the Information Commissioner because I received no acknowledgment, letters or response — no information of any kind.   The Minister, Deputy Harney, presides over an abysmal service that is not accountable, hides its errors and only acts when it is dragged out into the light of day in disgraceful circumstances, as happened in this case.I put it to the Minister it is time for change and for her to have a hands-on approach for the period left to her in Government.  I brought to her attention a report she has had since last November regarding the death of Peter McKenna at Leas Cross nursing home.  This inquiry was set up by the Minister set up and run by the HSE, using taxpayers' money, but it refuses to publish the report unless the family signs off on its acceptance of what the report contains and gives a promise to stay dumb and silent as to its content for ever and a day.  That is not good enough.  I have asked the Minister about this privately a number of times.  She has told me and can announce tonight that she will put that report into the light of day in this House so we can see exactly what went on in that case.  This inquiry was paid for by the Minister on behalf of the Government and the taxpayers of this country.It is time for change but we are getting more of the same, which is unacceptable.  The country is up in arms because fine and decent people are being put through appalling traumas because of the lack of determination from the Minister and her Department to make the HSE ultimately accountable for its errors.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The horrific problems of women who were told they had miscarried their babies but subsequently gave birth to healthy children have raised a number of questions about our maternity care, not least about its exorbitant cost in our Republic.  In a move that mirrors cross-Border shopping expeditions, women are halving the cost of giving birth by going to Northern Ireland.  When one considers there is a possibility of being refused admittance to a hospital run by the HSE because of some initiative or other and that in consequence one would have to travel miles to another facility, perhaps going across the Border is not unduly stressful.What women gain is a quieter hospital environment and lower medical costs.  One in eight babies born in Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry last year were born to women who had decided to opt out of the HSE system and into the Northern health care system.  The financial difference is quite marked.  In the Northern Ireland hospitals a private consultant charges approximately €2,300 for between eight and twelve antenatal visits and attendance at the birth.  The equivalent cost in the South is between €3,500 and €5,000.  The nightly rate in Newry for accommodation is also half that of the three main Dublin hospitals.  Cross-Border dental care is already well established as are food and drink shopping trips which, although detrimental to our economy, are not surprising given that Ireland is the second most expensive city in the EU for food.  These facilities are joined now by maternity care.  We have out-priced ourselves and are reaping the dubious rewards.Although no scandal in maternity care attaches to the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, there have been other medical scandals driven by HSE failures which have given grave cause for concern.  In one case phantom appointments were given for a dermatology consultant who had not worked at the hospital for the previous six months.  In another worrying cost-cutting measure the hospital refused to provide X-Rays and scans deemed necessary by local doctors for their patients, who were forced to travel to Dublin for the diagnostic procedures.  Cancer and mortuary services have been removed from the hospital.However, nothing could beat the shock for an expectant mother to be told she has miscarried her baby and that it will be aborted.  It is a miracle that Melissa Redmond had the conviction and presence of mind to seek a second opinion.  Otherwise her perfect baby would have been killed because there was an incorrect diagnosis of miscarriage when there was  a viable foetus.  This case encouraged other women to come forward leading to the setting up of a review which is to last for six months.  It will be chaired by Professor William Ledger.Patients must be protected from the general and specific mismanagement that has dogged the HSE since its conception.  No pun is intended.  The HSE has been the black hole of the medical sector.  In a game of pass-the-buck between the Minister and the HSE, patients have lost out, trust has been eroded and responsibility has been conspicuously absent as letters, requests for care and other medical requirement are lost in the general mayhem.Life is sacred.  Given our history of care for the unborn, this latest scandal is one too far.  How many times can the Minister escape the obvious conclusion?  She is not providing the medical care the people of this country deserve and the HSE is colluding with her in the mismanagement of the nation's health.  It beggars belief that with a population of approximately 4.3 million the Government cannot safeguard the people of this country and offer them a safe and efficient health service in which they can have complete confidence.That is not the case here and it is important that the Minister addresses the issue.

One of those was a courageous woman in County Galway who came forward and exposed what had happened in her case.  It is beyond belief that if these women had not sought a second diagnosis, their babies would simply have been killed.The HSE has received hundreds of calls from concerned families about the way they have been treated in maternity hospitals throughout the country.  In the aftermath of this scandal, the Minister for Health and Children must conduct an urgent investigation of maternity services, including the effectiveness of equipment and the training of staff.  It is a false economy with dreadful consequences for the HSE to operate in this slipshod manner.  Only last week a man was awarded €4.25 million in a settlement for an action over negligence at his birth in a Cork hospital.  How many more such settlements have taken place while services at the front line are being cut?It has recently been exposed that over €2.25 million was put aside in a SIPTU and HSE account to fund unnecessary foreign travel for officials and their spouses, yet we have not received an explanation.  How can I explain all this to the mother who came into my office on Monday who is a full-time carer in her home, looking after her sick, elderly husband and a handicapped daughter who is confined to bed and suffering double incontinence and who had her supply of nappies cut back because the HSE simply did not have the money?  Is that not a scandalous situation?  How can I explain this to the daughter who gave up her job to care full-time for her aged mother, who had a stroke and who cannot now feed or wash herself and needs 24 hour care, and has had her home help cut by half to six hours per week?  Everyone in this House could give several examples of such cases.There has been such a waste of money at the highest levels of the HSE.  Are the executives in the HSE not ashamed of themselves drawing bonuses on top of their salaries of €300,000 to €400,000 a year?  It is time somebody cried "Stop", and the buck stops with the Minister.  What will she do about it?  That is the question I am being asked every day in my office and on the street.  All our pleas are falling on deaf ears and the dedicated people on the front line must struggle on because the Government has run the health service into the ground due to its mismanagement of the economy and the health service over the years.The public have little recourse in these matters.  My wife has been involved in a patient focus group, but when a complaint is made to the hospital, the hospital management itself investigates the complaint.  What conclusion will they reach other than to back up their own staff?  It becomes extremely frustrating for the families of patients who have been mistreated in hospital to get any satisfaction when they make a complaint, because it is a closed shop inside.  The Minister would want to do something about that.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate Deputy Reilly on putting forward this motion.  The substance of the Fine Gael motion proposes the establishment of a new, independent patient safety authority which would incorporate the Health Information Quality Authority.  This is necessary because the State's existing health care complaints facility is a function of the HSE, as Deputy McCormack alluded to in his contribution.  Its staff are employees of the HSE.  Health complaints officers in other countries are independent of those countries' health service providers.  HIQA can only function effectively if it is answerable to an organisation that is independent of the HSE.  Today, it receives complaints from patients and feeds them directly back to hospitals and into the HSE's complaints system.I would like to raise an issue that the Minister might consider parochial, but it has the potential to become a serious national issue.  I refer to an indication by the HSE management that they are looking to replace the out of hours cover by specialist junior doctors in Donegal hospices with locum GP cover from the local out of hours Now Doc service.  Such cuts shatter the confidence of people in the HSE.  Replacing specialist palliative medical care with Now Doc care is unthinkable for hospice patients.  Locum GPs will not know patients' medical histories and will not have the required medical expertise, which is expressed in the Government's own 2001 report on palliative care.The report by the national advisory committee on palliative care in 2001 was described by the Minister as a blueprint for the future of Irish palliative care.  It is based on two principles.  A needs assessment is regarded as a foundation upon which health care priority setting should rest.  Specialist palliative care should be available in all care settings and should support the patient wherever he or she may be — at home, in hospital, in residential care, in day centres and outpatients or in a specialist palliative care unit.  There is a growing concern at local level in my constituency, among experts in the field and among patients, that this system of replacing specialist junior doctors with locum GPs does not represent the philosophy contained in the report.  The report also notes that all specialist palliative care services should have available an essential minimum core professional staff, with recognised post-qualification specialist training.  It states that in delivering palliative care, different professional groups will have areas of common interest that require different levels of specialist knowledge.How much did it cost the State to commission the report by the national advisory committee on palliative care?  Why is it being blatantly contravened?  Specialist junior doctors are paid monthly in block payments for providing this out of hours service in the HSE north-west area.  It is accepted by practitioners that there will be cutbacks and there has to be more value for money.  However, there is a proposal on the table that the HSE should pay specialist junior doctors on a call by call basis — there may only be 12 to 15 calls per month — rather than giving them a block payment per month.  I know the Minister will allude to the consultants' contract and say that this is not possible, but where there is a will, there should be a way.  This proposal would achieve the Minister's targeted savings while maintaining specialist out of hours palliative care.  Will the Minister engage with the practitioners and the experts on this proposal?

I can only imagine the distress, trauma and the hurt it has caused them and their wider families.  It is a serious matter and it is treated seriously.Since this issue arose, a number of changes have been put in place.  First, I want to deal with the issue that arose in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital last summer.  In July, when this issue was brought to the attention of the hospital, it introduced a requirement for a second scan and a requirement that where drugs were to be administered or surgical interventions were to take place that they would have to be signed off by a consultant obstetrician.In moving my amendment to the motion, I said that chief medical officer and Dr. White of the HSE have written to all obstetric units in the country, the 19 in the public system and those in the private system, advising them to take immediate measures where a miscarriage has been diagnosed and where drugs or surgical intervention is recommended that this would have to be approved by a consultant obstetrician.  That has been done to give women the reassurance they deserve.Prior to this matter arising, the HSE appointed Professor Turner in May of this year, as it has appointed 23 other clinicians to lead clinical care pathways, particularly in chronic illness management but in other areas where there is a high volume of activity.  The purpose of Professor Turner's appointment is to standardise care across our maternity services — to introduce protocols based on best international practice.  He is working with the college of obstetrics, first, in regard to producing guidelines and, second, to ensure that such standard of care is put in place as quickly as possible.  We did not have clinical leads in these areas until relatively recently with the appointment of the director of quality control and clinical care at the HSE.In addition to that, as the Deputies have acknowledged, there is a review of what happened not only in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital but of any other case that arose during the past five years where there was a misdiagnosis, where a miscarriage was diagnosed and where subsequently there was a viable pregnancy.The purpose of that review — which is chaired by the vice president of the college of obstetrics in the UK, Professor Ledger, who is joined by Professor Turner, Ms Sheila Sugrue, the lead midwife, and Cathriona Molloy from Patient Focus and a patient representative — is to make recommendations that will inform the new protocols that will be put in place.As Deputies are aware, misdiagnosis is a feature of all health care systems.  Misdiagnosis did not happen today or yesterday or since the formation of the HSE.  Unfortunately, for many years misdiagnosis in Ireland was covered up and swept under the carpet — that is a fact.  Much of the misdiagnosis that has been brought to public attention in recent years happened prior to the establishment of the HSE five years ago — that is fact.  The reality is that these issues were dealt with by way of litigation.  I advise Deputy McCormack that, by international standards, Ireland has a low level of litigation in regard to both brain damaged children and misdiagnosis generally.

Professor Turner made that point clearly and succinctly to the media only a few weeks ago in a very convincing fashion.  There is no substitute for expert clinical evaluation.  There are no tests, irrespective of how advanced they are, that are perfect.  There are tests and the use of diagnostic technology that have false positives and false negatives — that is a fact.  Tests have to be combined with expert clinical examination and expert clinical opinion.  When errors are identified or anticipated, particularly in areas where there is a high volume of activity and where the consequences can be very serious, we must have in place fail-safe measures that identify such errors, that enable us to quickly learn from them and to put into effect protocols to avoid them happening again.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I will not allow the Deputy to interrupt me; I want to continue to say what I have to say.The purpose of reviews is to learn from the experience and to put that learning into effect.  That is the reason we have them.  We have had a number of them and they have been put to good effect.  For example, in my Department since the Portlaoise incidents, a new patient safety protocol is in operation.  When letters in this respect arrive in a routine fashion in my office, that of any of the Ministers of State or that of any other member of the Government, they are handled by the office of the chief medical officer.  Heretofore, the chief medical officer and his team were advisers to the Department, now they head up a division that primarily deals with patient safety issues, and that is the appropriate response.  Correspondence is received from patients, lawyers, health care professionals, including doctors and it is not possible for a political head or anybody with a political perspective or an administrative background to be able to handle those issues appropriately.  They should be handled by the clinical expertise in the Department, and that is what happens.Patient safety generally has been a high priority of mine.  We have established HIQA and the purpose of doing so is to have an independent body, independent of the service providers, to set standards, monitor the implementation of those standards and enforce them.  HIQA is free to carry out its own reviews or it can carry out reviews if requested to do so by me.  It has been involved with this review group.  It was consulted on the terms of reference and the scope of the review.  Although there has been criticism that the review only extends back to the past five years, the review group will examine other issues that extend beyond five years from which there can be a learning that will influence protocols.In addition to establishing HIQA, if we are serious about having a quality authority, we have to be prepared when it makes recommendations to enforce them.  I spend hours in this House seeking to make changes in the interests of patient safety, but we are constantly opposed in that respect.  I challenge somebody to tell me that it is in order for a country with 4.4 million people to continue to operate the kind of hospital system we have at present, or particularly the one we had a few years ago which has improved, where 32 hospitals were performing breast surgery and in some cases a surgeon performed one procedure a year.  That system was defended by many Members of this House and others outside this House.  If we are serious about ensuring patient safety, we know that is not a safe environment for any woman to present herself for breast surgery.  The same applies in other areas of acute, critical and complex care.  If we are serious about ensuring patient safety, we must have the courage to back the decisions of those who seek to do something about patient safety, including the reform agenda in the north east.  If there is anybody in this House who believes we can have five hospitals for a population of 300,000 people operating to best international standards, providing safe care with the resources that this country can provide for health care, then they need to think again.  It makes sense to have critical and complex care in two hospitals in that region, which is what is now happening, and to have more minor procedures, including day procedures and the procedures most of us would have if we were sick, carried out in smaller hospitals.  Thankfully very few of us are seriously ill or require complex procedures.  When people need to go to hospital they generally require routine care, treatment of minor injuries and diagnostics.That type of care can be provided safely in smaller hospitals.  However, acute, complex and critical care cannot be provided in the number of hospitals in which it is currently available throughout the State.  Anybody who is serious about these issues must accept that.As part of our patient safety agenda we intend to introduce the licensing of all health provision, beginning with acute hospitals in the public and private sectors in 2012.  The legislation is currently being drafted and the Health Information and Quality Authority is producing draft standards which will be available next month for public consultation.  Those standards will underpin the legislation, and there will be a statutory requirement on all hospitals in the public and private sectors to meet them.  It is only by a system of licensing in accordance with standards with a statutory basis that we can guarantee to provide patients with the safest possible care.No authority can deliver that without the backing of legislation and statutory standards.  I hope that when those standards are produced next month there will be genuine engagement by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and by political parties in this House, so that we have an input that is wider than just the clinical community and those responsible for managing and running hospitals and which includes the political community.  The standards will be the basis on which licensing will operate.  Moreover, following the publication of the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance we are making legislative changes in addition to those in the licensing area.  The Health Information and Quality Authority Bill will provide for adverse reporting, clinical audit and open disclosure.  These are extremely important developments if we are to have a health care delivery environment that is focused on patient safety.I am delighted that Deputy Reilly supports the changes we made to introduce a majority on the Medical Council.  That is good for the profession and for patient confidence in the profession.  There was not much support for that provision when we introduced it in 2006; it was strongly opposed by many organisations, including many Members in this House.  Now, however, it is working well and doctors have great faith in the Medical Council despite the initial scepticism of many of them.  As part of that, a competence assurance process has been recently triggered whereby doctors will have to maintain their skills by engaging in professional education and training on an ongoing basis.  We all accept that scientific endeavour and the world of medicine is very complex and changes rapidly.  Persons who qualify today will not be fit for purpose in ten, 20 or 30 years unless they engage in ongoing professional education and training and meet competence assurance requirements.We introduced legislation on whistleblowing in the health service some years ago.  If any staff member in the public health services is aware of any issue where patient safety is at risk, he or she is totally protected by law in bringing forward that issue.  Our initiative in this regard was a first in this area.  There is much emphasis now on whistleblowing legislation for financial services and other areas; we did it in health several years ago.Under the new consultant contract, we now have clinical directors in all hospitals and in many care areas throughout the State.  They are responsible for audit, peer review, professional education and training, and for ensuring that appropriate risk management is being pursued by staff within their hospitals.  In addition to clinical directors at hospital and network level, we have the national needs directors who will be rolling out care pathways in many areas of chronic illness and other areas such as obstetrics.I said earlier that there is no substitute for clinical examination.  A full-time dedicated ultrasound sonographer will begin work on 15 July at the maternity unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The machine in question was examined in November last year and was found to be fit for purpose.  It was not an old or clapped out machine.  I understand it was five or six years old and that these scanners are expected to have a life span of at least seven years.  The reality is that a scanner on its own, as Professor Turner said recently in public, should not be relied upon.  There is no safe diagnostic test; it always must be backed up with appropriate clinical expertise.  Mistakes happen in the health service, some of which are genuine clinical errors.  Humans make mistakes; sometimes there is a lack of knowledge, sometimes a failure of communication and sometimes there are technical difficulties.  In regard to the provision of health care at hospital level, we must ensure we have a sufficient number of experts working together in settings such as maternity hospitals to ensure that whenever a risky pregnancy is involved or where there may have been a misdiagnosis of a miscarriage, that it is signed off by a consultant obstetrician.Deputy Reilly suggests we need a new authority.  I am frequently criticised in this House because there are too many authorities and bodies.  I did not see the programme but I understand Deputy Barrett spoke on television on Sunday night about the plethora of organisations in health care.  The reality, however, is that we have already subsumed a large number of those organisations in the health care area.  Some 58 were incorporated into the Health Service Executive on its establishment and, more recently, other organisations such as the Office of Tobacco Control and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency are also being subsumed into the executive.The reality is that setting up another organisation is not the way to deal with patient safety.  We must have patient safety at the heart of everything we do.  Every clinician, whether in primary care or hospital care, must be involved in patient safety.  We must have a licensing regime based on best practice internationally as far as the provision of services at hospital level are concerned.

That effort will involve the obstetric community and the new clinical leads the HSE is appointing.  In the case of obstetrics, that person is Professor Turner.These initiatives will go a long way to reassuring patients that patient safety is being taken seriously.  Some 70,000 births take place in this country every year and some 14,000 miscarriages, or approximately 20% of all pregnancies.  Deputy Reilly referred to 300 telephone calls, but not all those calls are necessarily from women who were subject to a misdiagnosis.  We must be clear about that.  We do not know what the number is over the past five years but we will when the review is completed and published forthwith.

All those records will be examined and will be made available to the review.  The reality is that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world to give birth.  We have very low levels of infant mortality, maternal mortality and perinatal mortality relative to other countries.  That is something for which we should be grateful.As far as I am concerned, as Minister for Health and Children, any error is an error too much.  Everything we are seeking to do is with the objective of minimising the capacity for errors.  In particular, it is about making sure we are open and transparent.  There is a requirement on hospitals, for example, to notify the State Claims Agency of all adverse events.  Everything I have learnt indicates that it is only by open disclosure and admitting errors that people will learn how to put things right.  The purpose of all we are doing is to learn from errors that occur so that we minimise the capacity of those mistakes ever recurring, recognising that there will never be an error-free world when it comes to health.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I begin by expressing my sincere sympathies to all women and their families who have been affected by these distressing incidents.  I take this opportunity to outline to the House additional areas that are being examined and developed following on from the recommendations of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.  Those recommendations set out an extensive and challenging agenda to develop the capabilities of our system in the area of patient safety.  Work in this area is being overseen by a broadly representative implementation steering group established by the Minister for Health and Children last June.  Work to implement the commission's recommendations includes the introduction of standards for better, safer health care, the HSE's directorate of quality and clinical care's work to establish national programmes for specific chronic diseases, and the development of the serious incident management team within that directorate.Progress is also being made in other areas.  In the area of service user involvement, the HSE and my Department have completed consultation on a proposed guide for service users that will prompt patients to engage assertively in their own health care and to ask questions designed to ensure their care is safe.  Regarding health information, a Bill to be published this year will provide the legislative and information governance framework for safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of health information while facilitating its more effective use.  This legislation is a fundamental prerequisite to modernising the delivery and planning of our health and personal social services to significantly improve the experience and outcomes of service users.  Also in this area, work is being progressed on laboratory information management and HIQA published GP messaging standards in April 2010, with preliminary testing to commence in July or August.In the area of education and training, the ISG has endorsed and agreed to promote in Ireland the use of the Australian patient safety education framework and associated WHO patient safety education curriculum guides.  Actions on foot of this decision include ongoing liaison with regulators and educators about implementation of the recommendations; engagement with the training schools and bodies; the completion by undergraduate medical schools of a self audit on current practices in this area; clear reference to patient safety included by An Bord Altranais in the newly approved requirements and standards for post-registration and continuing competence nursing and midwifery education programmes; and a patient safety education on-line training programme that has been commissioned though the HSE's medical education training revenue funding programme and that will be available to all medical training bodies in the coming months.Medication safety is a core area of patient safety, particularly as adverse drug events are the most frequent single type of adverse event.  The Irish Medication Safety Forum is now well established and working to improve communication and collaboration between the various bodies and health professionals with a role in medication safety.  A mapping exercise of Irish medication initiatives to identify and exchange information on the volume and breadth of medication safety initiatives ongoing throughout our health services has been completed by the forum.Arising from this, a number of initiatives have been undertaken and are ongoing at local and regional level throughout our health services to improve medication safety.  Some specific examples include the development of clinical pharmacy services in many hospitals, the EU safety vest project, the development of e-learning medication safety initiatives in certain hospitals, the Mental Health Commission audit of antipsychotic prescribing in Irish inpatient psychiatric units and many others.The Irish Medical Council published the seventh edition of the guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners in November 2009.  In this edition of the guide, the council has provided clarification on a number of specific areas, including consent, confidentiality, end of life care, provision of information to the public, prescribing practices and referral of patients.  Increased emphasis in recent years on patient safety has also influenced the expansion of guidance on adverse events and open communication with patients.  Regular meetings are taking place with all the professional regulatory bodies concerning fitness to practice issues in the newly-formed health and social regulatory forum.I congratulate the Minister on all the initiatives she has taken on patient safety.  It takes bravery and resolve to deal with these issues.  No system is perfect but we need to face up to and deal with these challenges.  That is what the Minister for Health and Children is doing.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Everyone wants full confidence in our health system, particularly women who have just discovered they are pregnant; it is both an emotional time and a vulnerable time when they place themselves completely under the expertise of those in the health service.  It is vital they enjoy full confidence in that time.For a woman to be told she has miscarried, or that her baby has died in the womb, is a dreadful experience.  When I head the case of Melissa Redmond, I am sure many women asked themselves if, when they decided to have a surgical procedure, it had happened to them.  We cannot have a health system that allows such questions to prevail and it is important that we move to reassure women.In that regard, I welcome the review that has been announced by the Minister, particularly that it will be carried out within six months and that its report will be published.  I also welcome some of the measures that have been put in place to bring about a situation where there will be a standard protocol in all obstetric units, particularly that the Chief Medical Officer has written to all obstetric units advising them to ensure the decision to use drugs or a surgical intervention in these circumstances must be approved by a consultant obstetrician.  This is critical, that the right people are involved in making these decisions on matters that are critical.  The fact that a clinical programme for obstetric care has been established by the HSE national director of quality and clinical care is welcome, as is the fact that where women are concerned about their care, they have access to the necessary information, support and reassurance.The Minister mentioned that there were 300 calls to the helpline but we will probably never know how many women have been affected because there will be those who do not phone and women who will never know if a misdiagnosis was made.  This is sad and is why it is so important that we move to reassure them.I compliment the Minister on the measures that have been introduced, particularly in the area of patient safety and the fact that the Department of Education and Skills is currently working on proposals for licensing legislation designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that health care providers do not operate below core standards which are applied consistently.  That is vital.  The legislation she mentioned that will be introduced toward the end of the year and implemented early next year is an essential step forward and legislation of this type is the direction to go.The Minister is also considering a national framework for clinical effectiveness and I encourage her to proceed with this so we have an effective means to establish and implement best practice in all areas of health care.  People should be confident no matter if they are visiting a hospital in Mayo or in Dublin.  This Minister has done a huge amount and she has told us in her speech what she has done about cancer.  In my constituency I know a lot about this, that we are giving people the best possible treatment in the best possible location, with the same standard throughout the country for private or public patients.An audit of hospital equipment should be carried out.  In some hospitals, many machines are close to the end of their lifespan and some machines are obsolete but remain in use.  People would be reassured by an audit being carried out in all hospitals to ensure equipment is safe and fit for purpose.I look forward to the review and welcome the measures that have been put in place to reassure women.  When the review is complete and we have the report, we will be in a position to have a standard system throughout the State and I look forward to that in the interests of all women.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	635	There is no doubt that there is a crisis of confidence in the health service that has been caused by a succession of scandals in recent years, most of them relating to misdiagnosis.  The one described by Melissa Redmond on television, and other mothers who subsequently came forward, went to the core of many women's need to feel confident in the early stages of pregnancy.  When they are told by an expert that the pregnancy is over and they will need a procedure to complete it, the very idea that it might not be the case has shaken women.Deputy Flynn put her finger on it when she talked about the women who must be wondering if it was right in their case.  Melissa Redmond was very brave, with a decent, nice looking family, and was dealing with this extremely well but I also thought of all the other women who will never be on television to speak about this issue but who feel deep in their hearts that this might have happened to them, that they had a viable pregnancy that was ended.  That is having a huge effect on women who might never come forward or telephone a helpline and there must be many women who feel like that.    I am very disappointed we do not have an independent inquiry because we simply have to restore confidence in the health services.  We will not do so by constantly reacting to events that have happened.  It is all very well for the Minister to state that from now on a consultant obstetrician must sign off before any procedure to end a pregnancy.  We are told an ultrasonographer will be in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in July.  We are told there will be an examination of equipment to ensure it all works properly.  However, this is all after the event.  It is closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  It is what has happened with regard to many inquiries; we have had interventions after events.  What we need are systems to ensure these events do not happen and the public has to know these systems are in place and that they are fail-safe.The Minister is correct to state that there will always be human errors in medicine.  Therefore, we have to put in place systems to ensure human errors do not lead to bad outcomes.  If a person states a pregnancy is over, there should be a system in place so another opinion is sought or a senior person is present.The report stated that equipment was fatigued and that the image resolution was not adequate to accurately assess early pregnancies and their complications.  The Minister was very disingenuous when she stated that it was only six years old and should have been good for business for another while.  It was described as "fatigued" because it was in use so much.  It is not necessarily a question of age.  It is a question of ensuring definite procedures are in place with regard to the age of a piece of equipment or how much work it has done.  I am not an expert on this but there are experts and people who know all of these things.  We must ensure these procedures are in hospitals.I spoke to someone who works in obstetrics who told me there is no equipment replacement procedure built into hospital budgets.  There should be an automatic renewal of that section of the budget when a piece of equipment is ready to be replaced and it should be built into the budgets.  What happens now is that if a piece of equipment is getting old and needs to be replaced, whoever controls the budget in the hospital must be chased to get the money to replace it.  That is not how it should be.  It should be built into the system so the money automatically comes into the budget when a piece of equipment needs to be replaced.  This is done elsewhere; it is written into businesses when they write the age factor of equipment into planning.  This should also be the case in hospitals, where patient safety and people's lives are involved.We do not have enough consultants, particularly consultant obstetricians given the population level.  We will now be faced with a shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors also.  There is a real fear in maternity hospitals, which are already very overcrowded, with regard to what they are expected to do and population growth.  They fear there will not always be time to do what is right.  We cannot let that happen in our hospitals.Deputy Reilly's motion proposes establishing a patient safety authority.  My wording would have been that we turn HIQA into a patient safety authority but we do not differ greatly on this point.  Deputy Reilly proposes that we introduce a patient safety authority and incorporate HIQA into it.  I do not really mind what language we use on this; what is important is the power the organisation has and its function.  There should be only one body and the Minister was being disingenuous when she stated the motion proposes the establishment of another quango.  That is not what is being proposed.  What is proposed is that the quango in existence would be replaced by another which would subsume it.  I would do it the other way around but that is not important and we will support the motion.What is important is that the body is given the appropriate powers to do what it needs to do.  HIQA does not have strong enough powers.  It can instigate investigations but it cannot always get all of the information it requires unless it is asked to carry out an investigation.  Issues arise with regard to the powers of HIQA.  The legislation did not give enough teeth to the organisation.  It can set standards and will do so on public and private hospitals, just as it has set standards on nursing homes.  However, the problem is ensuring the resources are there to implement the standards.  Unfortunately, on many occasions when the public system is not given sufficient resources, the standards are misused to close facilities rather than building up those facilities to comply with the standards, which is the approach we need to take.It is all very well having public and private hospitals subject to standards but private hospitals can turn away people.  They can pick and choose what they do.  Therefore, they can easily comply with standards.  More and more, the public system will be left with the more difficult and costly procedures.  This will make it more difficult for the public system to comply with the standards.  This is disingenuous.  One cannot compare like with like if one allows private hospitals to cherry-pick.  Ultimately, we do not agree with apartheid between public and private hospitals.  If everybody was in the same system, we would have the same standards for everybody, which is what any decent public health system in a democracy should have.A recommendation from the report into Rebecca O'Malley's misdiagnosis was that every hospital, and everywhere health care is provided, should have a patient advocacy service.  This is very important but it has never been properly implemented.  If one feels doubt about anything to do with one's treatment, one should be able to go to an independent advocate who does not represent the hospital but who speaks for the patient.  The patient has to be at the heart of this.  Deputy Reilly uses the name "patient safety authority".  Whether it be called the "patient information quality and safety authority" does not matter; the patient must be at its centre.  Advocacy at local hospital level is very important in this regard.

We welcome the fact that Fine Gael has used its Private Members' time to address this urgent and very serious health care issue.It is, without question, a hugely traumatising issue for possibly hundreds if not thousands of women who may find, or who may have reasonable grounds to believe, that their viable pregnancies were terminated after being wrongly diagnosed as miscarriages.  This is the first time the issue has been addressed substantively in the Dáil, despite the fact that Melissa Redmond's story was first revealed in the media at the start of June.  The Government refused to provide time for statements and a question and answer session with the Minister on an issue that is of huge concern to thousands of women and their families throughout the country.  I sought this opportunity repeatedly but without success.  Last week, the Minister for Health and Children responded to questions on this issue.  I stress "responded" because she gave responses rather than the answers that Deputies were seeking.I asked why the Minister, the Department and the HSE had to wait until after Melissa Redmond's story went into the public arena, when it was first known as far back as August 2009.  Did not the Minister, the Department or the HSE consider the implications of what was brought to their attention then, not only with regard to Melissa Redmond's story but for other women presenting at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and for women who, perhaps in other circumstances, would present or had presented, at other maternity units across the State?I asked why the Minister only responds when the spotlight of public attention is directed at an issue.  I find it very difficult to understand how something of such seriousness would not have triggered a spontaneous response throughout the system to try to establish the facts to eliminate any possible misdiagnosis presenting and reflect on the fact that many women are in anguish each night since the time this story first became public.  The Minister stated in response that from the time this case came to the attention of the HSE, her Department and the hospital, action was swiftly taken to establish what had happened.  That was only answering a different question, not the question put.  The question we still need answered is why the systems failure was not addressed and why the possibility of a systems failure beyond the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda was apparently not even considered until after the matter went public at the start of this month.The information given by the Minister in the Dáil last week was first revealed in answer to a parliamentary question tabled by me on 15 June.  In that reply the Minister admitted that the Melissa Redmond case had been brought to her attention as far back as August 2009.  When Melissa Redmond courageously spoke out about her experience in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda earlier this month she was followed by other women across the State with similar experiences.  The Minister, however, still stayed silent on the issue even though the numbers presenting continued to grow.  The early cohort of women were all women who, thankfully, had happy outcomes.  The diagnoses was questionable but they had enough within themselves to challenge that and seek a repeat diagnosis to secure confirmation of what they believed.  All of this represents a classic case of patients not being listened to.  We must have full disclosure of all of this.I welcomed the announcement of the terms of reference and review team for the HSE's miscarriage misdiagnosis review.  Women who have had these experiences need to be fully supported.  I encourage women to contact the maternity hospitals where they received treatment to ensure they can access the information regarding their treatment if they have any questions or concerns regarding their experiences.It is also welcome that from now on all decisions to use drugs or surgical intervention in women who have had a miscarriage diagnosis must be approved by a consultant obstetrician.  The question is, again, why it took this public scandal for that to be implemented.  Surely such a practice should have been in place.  It is only now, in the wake of media coverage, that the review and the changes in practice are being put in place.  This surely indicates a systems failure and examination of this failure should be added to the review's terms of reference.The Association for Improvements in Maternity Services Ireland, AIMSI, has pointed out what it calls the "widespread fragmentation of maternity care services", which includes huge variability in the type and standard of care available to women, a lack of continuity of care, poor communication between health care professionals and women in their care, over-reliance on technological equipment, as well as underfunded, overcrowded, understaffed centralised care units, which is very much the order of the day under this Minister and Administration.  Crucially, it points out that such a service does not create a space for the voices of women to be either heard or listened to and allows for an unacceptable margin for error.  This has undoubtedly resulted in undermining women's trust in the health care system.  I agree with AIMSI and others when they say it should not be the responsibility of individual women to ensure they receive such care but, rather, the responsibility of health professionals, the HSE and, ultimately, the Minister for Health and Children.AIMSI has also highlighted some very important information that the Minister and the HSE need to take on board and which should be examined by the review.  AIMSI states that it is aware of many instances of questionable antenatal scan diagnoses other than those highlighted in regard to foetal viability and early miscarriage diagnosis and misdiagnosis.  It is also aware of cases in which dating errors have led to the premature births of babies.  All of this information needs to be carefully examined and acted upon.There has been and clearly still is over-reliance on technological equipment.  That is why scans need to be checked and double-checked and repeated, especially in the case of miscarriage diagnosis.  Nothing can replace the skill and experience of the health care professionals.  Equipment must always be seen as an aid to that skill and not a substitute for it.  In a time of widespread health cutbacks there is a danger that the machine will be seen as the cheaper, easier option, rather than the full attention of the health care professional.Last week we raised with the Minister for Health and Children the need for her to order a full review of consent policies within the maternity system and initiate national guidelines for clinical practice in maternity care.  She replied that the HSE has recently established a clinical programme for obstetric care led by Professor Michael Turner of the Coombe Women's and Infants University Hospital and that an important priority in the programme will be the development and implementation of national guidelines for clinical practice.The Minister stated that she expected that, in regard to issues of consent, the provision of obstetric services in accordance with these guidelines, as is the case in all other health services, will meet ethical guidelines set by the Medical Council in 2009.  She also stated that the miscarriage misdiagnosis review announced by the HSE will inform the development of the proposed national guidelines.  That is welcome, as far as it goes. However, an internal HSE review is not enough.  As the motion tabled by Fine Gael and Deputy Reilly states, the role of HIQA needs to be enhanced.  An independent patient safety authority should be established.

Amendment No. 72 is in my name and Deputy Shatter already addressed his amendments.  The amendments are related in so far as they pertain to relationship between the biological parents and their spouses or relatives and their various rights to adoption and access to their children.Amendment No. 72 proposes that a parent, relative or someone acting in loco parentis should be able to apply to the court for access to the child subsequent to adoption.  This gives rise to the questions of open adoption and whether we should be closing off the relationships a child may have enjoyed prior to his or her adoption.  Under my amendment, the court would decide what is in the best interest of the child.  There are many reasons a court might decide to allow a right of access but I am leaving the option open for the court to decide otherwise.  These issues are more relevant to domestic adoptions than to intercountry ones, although they could arise in either instance.  In addition to commending amendment No. 72 to the House, I support Deputy Shatter on the issues he has raised.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	640	We have already had an extensive debate on this issue.  I do not intend to accept any of the amendments in this group for the reasons I outlined on Committee Stage.I accept it is unsatisfactory that natural mothers have to adopt their own children but the correct way to resolve this is through guardianship legislation.  In September 2009 the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper entitled Legal Aspects of Family Relationships and invited submissions from interested parties on the types of arrangements that could be made in guardianship legislation in order to facilitate a situation in which a person attempts to form a relationship with a child of a spouse or partner.If we try to address this issue by way of amendment at this late stage, it will have a profound effect on other obligations in adoption law.  Deputy O'Sullivan noted that her amendment tries to capture the idea of open adoption but this would be contrary to what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.  On the basis of the Law Reform Commission paper due to be published at the end of this year, we will discuss with the Department of Justice and Law Reform, which has responsibility in the area of guardianship, the kinds of issue that may arise.  The paper deals with a number of complex issues and it would not be satisfactory to attempt to address them by means of this Bill.The Adoption Board has for many years pointed out that it is unsatisfactory and inappropriate to require a birth parent to adopt his or her own child.  Such parents surrender their sole parental rights and assume joint parental status with the step-parents.  The Law Reform Commission canvassed opinions on whether a minimum period should apply within which a step-parent would have to form a relationship with a child before an adoption could be effected.  The same question would have to be asked in regard to guardianship.  It also asked whether an adoption should only be done by agreement or if a step-parent should be able to make an independent application.  I do not think we have clearly considered these issues in the context of this Bill and, for that reason, I do not accept the proposed amendments.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The Adoption Board's annual report for 2008 indicates that 217 out of 273 applications for adoption, or 79%, and 128 out of 200 court orders, or 64%, were in respect of birth mothers and their husbands.  Similarly, the annual report for 2007 indicates that birth mothers and their husbands comprised 217 out of 303 applications to the board, or 72%, and 138 out of a total of 187 family adoption orders, or 74%.The overwhelming majority of domestic adoptions are by biological mothers adopting their own children with their husbands.  The Adoption Board has been calling for legislative change for more than 20 years.  We can change the law in two ways.  The first is to allow a guardianship order to be made in favour of the spouse who is not a parent and the second is to allow the spouse who is not the biological parent to seek an adoption order while the biological parent retains equal rights to the child.I do not buy anything the Minister of State has said.  He advises us that we should not amend the Bill at this late stage even though these amendments were canvassed at great length on Committee Stage in February.  This afforded him four months to consider our arguments.  He stated that he favours a guardianship arrangement but he voted down my amendment allowing for guardianship orders simply because the Law Reform Commission produced a working paper but not a final report.  Given that the commission has published a plethora of final reports which were not implemented, this is not a valid reason for rejecting my amendment.  He suggests that all sorts of complications arise in implementing my proposal but that is not the case because the spouse married to the biological parent would have to be properly assessed and deemed to meet all the criteria set out in legislation.This is an important amendment which will bring the ethos of our law from 1952 to the present millennium.  The Bill is consolidating rather than reforming and it has abysmally and scandalously failed to implement 95% of the reforms recommended by a broad range of reports commissioned by the Government and other organisations.  It is my intention to put the amendment to a vote.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	642	According to the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of the Bill is to provide "for restating or updating of the provisions of the Adoption Acts 1952-1998, as appropriate, and for the repeal of those Acts.  It also gives force of law to the Hague Convention".  The purpose of the amendments is to ensure the legislation is as comprehensive as possible, which is clearly not the intention of the Minister of State given that he has rejected amendments on tracing, the right to one's birth certificate, post-adoption services and the other issues under discussion.As Deputy Shatter noted in reading from the reports, the amendments in this group relate to the vast majority of adoptions in this country in recent years and the circumstances in which people find themselves.  It is wrong, therefore, to choose not to incorporate these provisions in what is intended to be comprehensive adoption legislation covering all the elements and types of adoption that are likely to arise in the foreseeable future.The Minister of State indicated he will introduce legislation dealing with issues such as tracing.  Given the legislative pressure on the Government, I do not believe it will be possible for him to do so in the near future.  For this reason, I urge him to take this opportunity to make the Bill as comprehensive as possible.  He appears to agree that the issues covered in the amendments need to be addressed.  The proposals have been recommended in reports issued by the Law Reform Commission.  It is wrong to reject the elements we are proposing to have incorporated in the Bill to make it as comprehensive as possible.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	646	While I accept that both Deputies were referring to domestic adoptions, to argue that the Bill does not do anything, has failed abysmally and does not, in any way, move matters forward is to forget that the vast majority of adoptions are international adoptions.  As we all know, the Bill updates Irish law and provides significant safeguards in an area that is notoriously difficult to navigate for prospective adoptive parents.  I hope to achieve this objective in the next couple of days.  It is wrong, therefore, to argue the Bill does not achieve anything.I am not making up problems about step-parent adoptions or guardianship applications.  The Law Reform Commission has identified this issue in its consultation paper and invited submissions about an identified list of issues that need to be addressed.As regards tracing, I have given a commitment that the Government will legislate in this area.  Many of those who have made representations to me accept that separate legislation as opposed to a piecemeal amendment is required.  It has been my intention throughout to introduce separate legislation on tracing.  As I stated, I have made a commitment in this regard and hope to realise it.  If the Deputies wish to put their amendments, it is within their gift to do so.

In page 25, line 14, after "Executive" to insert "or other accredited body".These amendments relate to allowing a body other than the HSE to furnish a report as to the suitability of someone to adopt to the adoption authority.  We went into the reasons for this in great detail on Committee Stage and I will give the Minister an opportunity to respond as to whether he has had second thoughts on this issue.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I have not had second thoughts on the issue.  I am satisfied the HSE must have a role at the end of the process and it must be notified in circumstances where there is a discontinuance as set out in section 21.  It states "By notice delivered to the Health Service Executive at any time after an application under section 20, the applicant or applicants may discontinue the proceedings that are the subject of that application” and it in turn advises the adoption authority.  Any other accredited body under the legislation would be registered with the adoption authority so it would have the effect of notifying the authority in that fashion.  The intention of the amendment is captured in the legislation anyway so it is not my intention to change my mind.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I move amendment No. 36:
In page 25, to delete lines 29 and 30.These amendments propose in section 23(1) to delete the specific reference stating: "The Authority shall not make an adoption order unless the child— (b) at the date of the application, is not more than 7 years of age,”.  The proposal is to delete that provision and substitute on page 25, line 45, which is section 24(2), an additional provision.  Section 24(2) currently states: “Before making an adoption order under subsection (1), the Authority shall give due consideration to the wishes of the child, having regard to his or her age and understanding.”  The amendment proposed would state: “Where the child is over seven years of age, having regard to his or her age, maturity and understanding, the Authority would give due consideration to the wishes of the child.”The effect of this is to make express provision to ensure the wishes of children over seven have had regard to while removing what is an antiquated and unnecessary provision which simply reiterates a section in the Adoption Act 1952, which essentially prohibits the adoption authority from making an adoption order unless the child at the date of the application is not more than seven years old.  It then allows, where the child is over seven, in particular circumstances that one can adopt a child over seven.  I do not understand why we are just repeating what is an unnecessary provision inserted in the 1952 Act in legislation to be enacted in 2010.  The proposal I have brought forward is a more sensible way of approaching the issue.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I do not intend to change this area.  It is not clear from Deputy Shatter's proposal or comments what he is trying to correct and what problem is to be addressed.  There is an arbitrary nature in picking a certain age in any respect and all of us would have different views as to when a child might be properly consulted about something as significant as an adoption.  In any case, section 24 — as already pointed out by the Deputy — already ensures that a child reaching the age of seven can be adopted and in those circumstances due regard is had for the wishes of the child, with the safeguard that regard would be had for the child's best interest.  This is mirrored to some extent in other parts of the law where a child's own wishes may not be in his or her best interests.  Such issues must be distinguished, which is why this element is in the Bill.  It is not my intention to change the law in this area.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I move amendment No. 48:
In page 29, to delete lines 37 to 43 and in page 30, to delete lines 1 to 4 and substitute the following:"33.—(1) (a) The Authority shall not make an adoption order, or recognise an intercountry adoption effected outside the State, unless—(i) the applicants are a married couple who are living together,(ii) the applicant is the mother or father or a relative of the child, or(iii) the applicant, notwithstanding that he or she does not fall within subparagraph (ii), satisfies the Authority that, in the particular circumstances, the adoption is desirable and in the best interests of the child.(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Authority may recognise an intercountry adoption effected outside the State on the application of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (c) of section 90(3).”.The purpose of amendments Nos. 48, 50 and 51 is to reformat section 33 and to ensure that an adopted person or a person with an interest in the matter who wises to have particulars of an adoption entered into the register of inter-country adoption as provided for under section 90 and who is married does not need the consent of a spouse in order to have the adoption recognised.  In other words, only adoptive parents require each other's consent to the adoption.The amendment to section 33 provides that if the person applying for recognition of an inter-country adoption effected outside the State is the adopted person or a person with interest in the matter as referred to, the person does not have to meet the minimum age requirement of 21 years.  The age limit of 21 in this subsection is only relevant in the context of the adoptive parents at the time of the making of the adoption order or the recognition of the inter-country adoption order.I will speak to amendment No. 49 proposed by Deputy Shatter.  If the applicant is a spouse of the child's parent, the married couple may apply to adopt the child under section 33(1) but not if the child is a child of marriage.  Under existing legislation children of widows or widowers who remarry cannot be adopted by their surviving parent's new spouse.  Children of a marriage can only be adopted in exceptional and very limited circumstances, which provision is not altered in this scenario.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution will have a significant bearing in this area.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	667	The Minister of State made reference to the specific circumstance I was addressing in amendment No. 49 where the applicant is a spouse of the mother or father of the child in circumstances where, for example, a couple, the husband or wife of which is widowed at an early stage in the marriage and has a young child.  There is a similar issue as to whether if the widow or widower remarries the new spouse should be entitled to have all of the parental rights that would normally attach to a biological parent.  It is another anomaly in the law that in those circumstances an adoption cannot be effected.  This proposal is designed to address that issue.

I am aware of specific cases that fit exactly the case made by him.  All too often tragedies and circumstances present that the current wording will not accommodate.  This is reflective of a set of circumstances that is real and will repeat.  We now have an opportunity to reflect on this fact.  So many different marital relationships are the make-up of Irish society today.  It is important to bear in mind that strong bonds are created between the spouses of one or other parent of a child which becomes part of a newly established family unit.  It is important that in any given eventuality we accommodate the right of the surviving partner, although he or she may not be natural parent of the child but with whom the child has bonded and formed a faithful and loving relationship, to adopt the child.  I believe the case is compelling and that if we do not take on board the arguments presented and duly reflect this in the legislation we are missing an opportunity.I support the case made by Deputy Shatter and believe it is fully meritorious of acceptance by the Minister of State.

We have dealt with this matter in detail.  I do not wish to be unhelpful but we have gone through this matter to a great extent.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	670	This is an area where I do not believe there is a constitutional problem.  In respect of a widow or widower with young children who marries, there is no particular reason an arrangement cannot be contained within our adoption legislation which allows the person he or she marries to adopt the children.  One then creates a situation whereby the biological parent and the spouse to whom he or she is married retain equal rights in relation to the children.  This is not intended to be about a situation where, for example, a married couple — which we know we have difficulties with pending a constitutional referendum — give up their children voluntarily.  That is an issue we addressed in the referendum proposal and involves a married parent with all of the constitutional rights conferred by Article 41 apparently trying to divest themselves of rights that are described in the Constitution as inalienable.  We have sought to address this.In these circumstances there are a small number of families in this country afflicted by tragedies.  Young men and women are losing their lives in traffic and other accidents and on occasion as a consequence of violence.  It is extraordinary that we should have a law that states, for example, that a 29 or 30 year old husband or wife with a child of two years of age whose spouse has died in a car crash and who remarries at some time in the future and whose spouse wishes to acquire parental rights, having established a good relationship with the child-children, is not allowed to acquire the same rights and obligations in law towards the children or to have constitutional recognition as would normally apply had one not suffered a tragedy or would have continued to apply had one's spouse not died.My problem with the Government's approach to this legislation and the Minister of State's unwillingness to address this particular issue, among all the other issues we have raised, derives from the fact that we have had 20 years of examination of our adoption laws and a plethora of Ministers, many well before the Minister of State's time, promising to update our laws, address the anomalies and unfairness and allow for the variety of family circumstances that occur to be addressed in a manner that is humane and sensible.  Yes, this legislation will finally bring into force in this country the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption but there is much more we should be doing.  This legislation has been essentially awaited for more than a decade.  I do not believe there is any remote possibility of our seeing during the remaining lifetime of this Government a reforming adoption Bill addressing the myriad issues we have raised.On this particular issue, there is a small number of people in this country whose lives would be improved by acceptance of this amendment.  There are people in the future whose lives will be improved by it.  I wish to put the amendment.

There is no justification for perpetuating an injustice, which is exactly what presents in these sets of circumstances, where they apply.  I cannot understand why we would miss the opportunity during the passage of this Bill to address what we must recognise.  Deputy Shatter stated that a small number of people are affected.  One would be surprised by the number of people affected.  All too sadly we hear statistics in regard to young people losing a partner in a whole series of circumstances, including accidents, road traffic or otherwise, or for health related reasons.  A particular case comes to mind.I find it difficult to understand why we would perpetuate that anomaly, to put in those terms.  Surely, this is the appropriate and right time to correct and extend that opportunity to the people so described in the amendment.  I believe it will contribute to good outcomes, both for the caring adoptive parent in these circumstances and for the child for whom this relationship will be crucial throughout the rest of his or her childhood years and into the future.  I strongly commend it to the Minister of State because I recognise these circumstances.  I believe the amendment can only do good.

I appreciate that the number of people who belong in this category may be small.  The Government intends to put a referendum to the people that would clarify this situation for once and for all.  There would be no doubt whatsoever.  As Deputies Ó Caoláin and Shatter will know, the committee ordained that the heads of an adoption Bill would be published before a referendum would take place.  Obviously, that will have to capture the kinds of issues that have been raised.  It would be more appropriate to address the matter in that way than by means of a Report Stage amendment.

In page 31, line 7, after "them" to insert the following:"(or either of them, if a failure by one only of the married couple to comply with this section would not seriously threaten the welfare of the child)".I am proposing to amend the wording of section 34, which currently provides that an adoption order shall not be made "unless the Authority is satisfied that the applicant or, if the applicants are a married couple living together, each of them ... is a suitable person".  The applicants need to have enough money, etc.  The various requirements, which are listed in section 34, include the requirement to support "the child's development" and the requirement to value the child's "ethnic, religious and cultural background" and identity, etc.  Amendment No. 54 proposes that it should not be necessary for both parents to tick all of the boxes listed in this section of the Bill.  In other words, I suggest it should suffice for each requirement to be met by one parent or the other — both parents should not have to meet all of the requirements.I have proposed amendment No. 55 because I am particularly concerned that the test should not be as strongly applied if "a natural parent or relative of the child" is applying to adopt the child as it would be if a complete stranger were applying to adopt the child.  If a mother is adopting her own child, or a grandparent is adopting his or her own grandchild, she or he should not be refused simply because she or he might not have "adequate financial means", for example.  In other words, the test should not be too broad or rigorous in the case of an adoption by a natural parent, grandparent or other relation.  In such circumstances, these tests should not be as strong as they are for other types of adoptions.  That is basically what I am trying to achieve in these amendments.  We had a good discussion on them on Committee Stage.  There seemed to be a general acceptance that the test should not be quite as demanding when those applying to adopt are directly related to the child.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The requirements set out in section 34 are very wide.  One of the criteria to be followed when determining suitability is that the applicant should be "in good health".  How would one define "good health"?  Is it not a very broad phrase?  Questions could be asked about the "good health" of any of us.  It has the potential to be interpreted in a wide, broad manner.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has said, there can be circumstances in which the natural parent may wish to adopt.  The partner or spouse of a mother who is adopting her own child may not be "in good health", according to the determination of the person responsible for making such a decision.  One's health changes as one moves through life, but that does not alter one's ability, commitment or suitability as an adoptive parent.  This section of the Bill is all about suitability.  I have to say Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is making a valid point.  I have mentioned just one example — the ground of "good health" — from the set of criteria provided for in this section of the Bill.  Not every person will be able to tick all of the boxes.  That does not and should not preclude consideration of such a person's spouse or partner, if he or she applies to adopt.  If the natural parent of the child is seeking to adopt, it is an indisputable situation.  I strongly support the Deputy's appeal to the Minister of State.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	681	The requirement to assess prospective adoptive parents is set out in the Hague Convention.  The convention refers to "parents" rather than to one or other parent.  We have to ensure the best interests of the child are placed at the centre of this assessment.  That requires that both prospective adoptive parents are assessed.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan quite fairly raised the question of a natural parent who may be seeking to adopt.  It has to be acknowledged that there is a requirement for an applying adoptive parent to have "adequate financial means".  A natural parent who has raised a child perfectly well up to the point of the application might be found not to have "adequate financial means".  No specific sum is provided for — one's means simply need to be adequate to one's purpose.  The health and presentation of the child would serve as proof that one's financial means are adequate, regardless of what they might be.  There is a requirement that both prospective adoptive parents be assessed.I acknowledged earlier that it is not ideal for a natural mother to have to adopt her own child.  It can give rise to the kind of oddities mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  It is odd for one to have to prove one is in good health before one can adopt one's own child.  I suggest that the requirements are suitably onerous.  One has to put the best interests of the child first, particularly in the context of international adoption.  When one is assessing whether a child who has come through some trauma in his or her life should be placed with a prospective adoptive parent, one has to consider whether that person is capable of bringing the child up in the child's best interests.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept these amendments.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	684	In 2004 the Sligo Borough Council embarked on the development of plans for the social, economic and physical regeneration of Cranmore, in Sligo city.  From this overall development plan, came a social plan and a physical plan.  Both these plans included ideas for economic development.  The social plan was adopted September 2007.  I am happy to acknowledge that it is now being implemented.The plan for the social regeneration of Cranmore is an integral part of wider plans for the integrated development of Sligo , and particularly the eastern side of Sligo city.  The economic viability of the wider plan has been tested and accepted. Investment in the physical regeneration of Cranmore and a new eastern bridge are integral elements of the plan.  The national spatial strategy and plans for the future development of the eastern side of Sligo city include additional road transport links to all the public services and facilities on the eastern side of Sligo, such as the hospital, the Institute of Technology and many of the major employers in Sligo.  These road links are important to the overall development of both Sligo town and Sligo county.  An eastern bypass for traffic wishing to pass through Sligo is also an important objective of the planning for the region, including travellers to and from Northern Ireland and tourists.  It is much needed.In December 2008 a majority of borough councillors voted to remove the eastern bridge from the plan.  We need not inquire into how and why this decision was made.  However, the decision was made.  This decision has thrown the entire plan for the regeneration of Cranmore and the development of the eastern side of Sligo into confusion.  The decision has stalled all practical progress on the regeneration of Cranmore.  There is little evidence that the decision to remove the eastern bridge from the development plan for the eastern side of Sligo has brought any benefit to the future for Sligo town and county.  There are some voices saying that the decision has damaged the credibility of Sligo as a serious location for future economic development and the gateway status of the region.I can understand that a small number of people will be upset by the plans for the new eastern bridge.  All development brings advantages and disadvantages.  The reality on the ground is that Sligo city is built on a narrow bit of land between the sea and Lough Gill.  This is the fundamental reason the town is located where it is.  We do not have the luxury of going east or west until we find a crossing point that will be acceptable to everyone and will impact on no one.  Nor will the country offer to build a tunnel under Sligo so that the construction of new bridges can be avoided.  Geography is a fact of life.  There are very few suitable locations for building bridges across the River Garavogue.I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, who has responsibility for this matter in the House.  During a visit to Sligo last year, the Minister of State made it very clear that if the bridge was not put back on the development plan, the funding for the regeneration would be gone.  During the visit, the Minister of State may have indicated that the project investment will come from two different streams of funding and departments.  This, in turn, had the unintended consequence of allowing some people to claim that Cranmore regeneration and the eastern bridge are independent projects.  This is not true.Over €100 million of investment funding is at stake here. The various elements of the project have been through the planning process.  Everything is formally approved.  Almost all the statutory approvals are in place and nearly everything is ready for the project investment to proceed.The economic and social wellbeing of the eastern side of Sligo city, as well as the county and region, is held back at the moment and access to the services and facilities on the eastern side of Sligo are restricted.  With the present restricted transport arrangements, it is too difficult for most of the people of Sligo to get to the hospital, to the IT campus, to St. Angela's College and to most of the major employers in the town.  All these facilities must have good access routes.This matter is one of those rare occasions where I am speaking in support of the Minister of State and what I believe to be his policy of investing in local infrastructure to the benefit of all the citizens of Sligo.  Sligo needs this investment funding.  There are thousands unemployed and thousands facing economic hardship. This investment will bring jobs and hope to Sligo town and Sligo county.I ask the Minister of State to make a clear and categorical statement about the circumstances under which the investment funding for Cranmore regeneration will be released.  This investment is needed in Sligo.  This investment will bring major benefits to Sligo city and county.  Will the Minister confirm that he is now prepared to issue a ministerial order to permit this investment in the development of Sligo to proceed?

I also welcome his support for my position on this matter.  I know that to be his position locally in Cranmore and in Sligo.  That information is readily available to me from people who are of the same opinion as myself, namely the residents of the Cranmore estate.  I acknowledge Deputy Perry's support and the activity he has engaged in with the people of Cranmore regarding this very important matter for the development of Sligo.I am keenly interested in the regeneration of Cranmore and the development of Sligo as a gateway under the national spatial strategy.  I have engaged at every level, with the elected members, the county manager and his officials and community representatives in an effort to advance this project.The Cranmore regeneration area has a population of over 2,000, of whom over 1,500 are living in the Cranmore estate.  The Cranmore estate itself is strategically located relative to the town centre and was built on a phased basis between 1974 and 1992.  It is home to approximately 10% of the population of Sligo Borough.  In June 2006, the council submitted its draft framework plan for the regeneration of the area and because of Sligo's gateway status the scope and boundaries of the regeneration project were widened to include lands in proximity to CranmoreRegeneration programmes take a holistic and strategic approach and are aimed at creating sustainable communities by addressing fundamental social and economic considerations — not just bricks and mortar considerations — as well as looking at wider issues such as infrastructure generally, accessibility, tenure mix, social exclusion and anti-social behaviour.  To date approximately €14 million has been spent on the project in advance of the masterplan.Following detailed discussions with my Department, Sligo Borough Council have prepared a detailed brief for the appointment of a multi-disciplinary design team to prepare a masterplan for the regeneration project.  The masterplan will cover the whole of the eastern quadrant and I am anxious that it should be mindful of Sligo's gateway status and facilitate the future growth and development of Sligo as envisaged under the national spatial strategy.However, the development of the masterplan has been delayed following the decision to delete the new eastern bridge and associated access roads from the new Sligo Borough development plan, adopted at the end of 2009.  The brief for the masterplan was developed on the basis of the development objectives in the previous plan, which included the bridge-access routes.  It is essential that we build effective links between the redevelopment of areas like Cranmore and the surrounding town in terms of access to services, employment and education, social and economic infrastructure.  The regeneration of the eastern quadrant cannot be isolated from the development of Sligo and adequate access is an essential prerequisite for this part of Sligo.  In terms of the proposed location of the new bridge, there is only very limited scope for considering alternatives because a special area of conservation lies immediately upstream, and contains highly significant alluvial woodland.  The existing location was agreed following extensive local consultation and a lengthy oral hearing by An Bord Pleanála.I have demonstrated my commitment to the regeneration project by allocating €4 million in 2009 and a further €3.5 million in 2010.  I have made it clear that the completion of the masterplan is an urgent priority and that further funding is contingent on the adoption of this plan.  I visited Sligo after the new development plan was adopted in order to see the area and the proposals at first hand.  I met with local representatives and community groups and explored their concerns.  My Department has subsequently been available to engage with the council on technical and practical issues. I am very much committed to the project and I encourage the borough council to work with my Department and the local community to progress it for the benefit of Sligo and its residents into the future.I assure the Deputy I am totally committed to this project.  I want to send out a clear message to the people in Cranmore and Sligo, and to the borough council.  The development of Cranmore as a regeneration area cannot take place in isolation from access routes on the bridge.  Whatever leeway exists regarding the bridge is very limited as the Deputy knows well.

I would say to the borough council it should, in the best interests of the citizens of Cranmore and Sligo, which is now a gateway town, reverse its decision regarding the change in the town development plan.  Sligo County Council supports my position and that of my Department on this matter.  I understand all the elected Oireachtas Members from Sligo are also in favour of my position.

The people of Cranmore are crying out for this development.  It is estimated that more than €100 million will be invested in the region in developing that bridge and in the regeneration of Cranmore.  This is dependent on a decision of the local borough council.I will not address the matter of ministerial intervention now.  I would like local people and their representatives to take this decision but I shall certainly keep it under review.

This decision will increase their worries and concerns, especially regarding the 24,000 people per annum admitted to the emergency department in Dundalk who must now go to Drogheda.  I understand half of the hospital's 48,000 admissions will now go to Drogheda.  The real concern is for those who might have a heart attack and be in extremis.  The care they get at present will be physically taken from them in terms of the hospital environment of Dundalk.  How can this be better for them?  The care they get in Louth County Hospital will no longer be available to them.  They are worried because of the time it will take to reach the hospital in Dundalk and thence to Drogheda.  People who live in Carlingford or Omeath, for example, live approximately 61 km from Drogheda.  On average it takes up to an hour to get to Drogheda.  One may have a serious illness, specifically requiring immediate and urgent attention, and may suffer trauma, especially if a heart attack or a stroke are in question.I understand the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is to add an extra ambulance in the area.  There will be more ambulances to bring people to Drogheda but those ambulances will have to travel longer distances.  The concern is that a greater specialty would be available in Dundalk, greater than what the Minister proposes.  I ask her to look at this issue again.  I understand there can be specially trained paramedics who could adminster on-site specialist care in Dundalk in extreme cases.  That is the real worry for people.  Everybody accepts our hospitals have to change and that if one wants to opt into a service and is not a trauma or urgent medical case, it is possible to travel to a different place.  However the time concern in this instance is a great worry to people and the fact that people may die on that journey is of concern.This point was made by 24 doctors who signed a letter in a recent edition of the Dundalk Argus.  They stated, “We, as general practitioners and gatekeepers of the health services in the Dundalk area, were ignored in any decision making process”.  They attended two meetings with their representative and were informed of the intended transformation process. They further stated:The decision to remove accident and emergency services and acute hospital care was a fait accompli.  Our opinion was not considered.  We had no influence on the decision making process.  The removal of the A & E services and acute medical care will result in increased hardship to the people of north Louth.Twenty-four local general practitioners signed that letter, expressing professional and medical concern.Ultimately, we believe Drogheda will struggle to cope with the extra 24,000 patients per annum who will come into the emergency department, notwithstanding the fact that a brand new department opened only last week.  The closure of the Louth County emergency department will lead to massive increased pressure on the already strained Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital which has suffered badly from the closure of services in surrounding areas.  This has placed increased pressure on the hospital but resources have not been increased in proportion, especially in terms of bed capacity.People worry about the closure of health services in Dundalk without adequate alternatives being in place.  Everybody accepts things must change but now there is a greater worry that people who previously would have been seen in Dundalk by properly trained and skilled emergency doctors and technicians will no longer have that service in place and must travel to Drogheda to get it.  I ask the Minister what are the extra reassurances, if any, she can provide at this stage.  What especially trained ambulance personnel can she place in situ in Dundalk?  I understand that one of the ambulances the Minister proposes to add to the mix will be based in Carrickmacross which is a significant distance away.  I reiterate the concerns of people living in north County Louth, especially where there is a topography of mountainous terrain.  There is one main road but many of the by-roads are traditional country roads on which it is impossible to make good time.  People believe that by the time the seriously ill get to Dundalk they may well have passed on.  That is the real worry for people.  I ask the Minister to address those issues.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I thank Deputy O'Dowd for raising this issue.  It is ironic that we are discussing this issue some 90 minutes after discussing patient safety.  I assure the Deputy that everything being done in this regard is being done on the basis of the best clinical advice available to me and the HSE.  I am conscious there are concerns and worries among the population of north Louth; that is to be expected.  However, I am equally aware that the most senior clinicians in this country, led by Dr. Michael Power, who leads for the HSE in regard to critical care and is based in the Mater Hospital, a man with enormous experience and expertise and a leader among his peers, have strongly recommended that this transfer should take place now rather than in the autumn.As the Deputy is aware, it was intended that this transfer would take place in October, in line with the reconfiguration.  The new accident and emergency department has opened in Drogheda and is four times bigger than the previous such department.  The minor injuries unit will operate from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. in Drogheda.  There is an additional 24 hour seven day week ambulance, to be based in north Louth.  When patients are seriously ill and must be taken to a hospital the critical factor is the advanced paramedics who arrive on the site.  The Deputy is right to emphasise the significance of the ambulance and paramedic support.  In every system throughout the world at which we looked, pre-hospital care and first point of care are often where the most significant intervention takes place, especially when a person experiences a heart attack.  He or she can be brought to a place and be offered the best possible chance of recovery.  We know that some people with heart conditions who reach the appropriate place within two hours and have stenting can effectively reverse a heart attack.In the first place, the pre-hospital service is important and that has been strengthened in the area.  The ambulance service has assured us it is taking measures to strengthen and increase the resources available.  Second, there is an additional 24-7 ambulance to be based in north Louth.  The ambulance service took the view that the current service in Monaghan should be switched to Carrickmacross to provide better cover for the catchment.  In addition, Daisy Hill Hospital will be available.  There are protocols for patients to be taken to the hospital if that is appropriate.Louth County Hospital has a good future.  Its future will be in doing different things, such as more elective work and more diagnostics.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has strongly made the case for a colonoscopy service to be provided there.  From 1 January we will be providing a national colorectal screening programme.  The Minister, Deputy Ahern, asked that the colonoscopy service for the north east be based in at Louth County Hospital and I strongly support that.  I see no reason that we cannot make that happen.  I know it is the view of the clinical director, Dr. Ó Branagáin, and through discussions with the cancer control programme, I will ensure that Louth County Hospital is where this service will be provided in the region, rather than at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which will always be under pressure as one of the main hospitals in the north east.Reconfiguration of hospital services is always challenging and worrying for the public because people become very reassured by having a hospital in their midst.  However, we all want the best possible care for members of our families if they are sick.  We want them to be taken to the most appropriate place, wherever that is.  As they say in the medical world, the right people in the right place at the right time provide the best possible result.  The north east has five acute hospitals for a population of 300,000.  We are moving into a licensing regime for acute hospitals, probably beginning in 2012 or 2013.  The legislation will be published by the end of this year or the start of 2011.  We want public consultation on that.  The standards that will have to be met by the hospitals will be published next month in draft form by HIQA, and again will be subject to public consultation.  These will form the basis of the new law, which has been recommended by most people, including medics, nurses and doctors, as well as the patient safety commission.At a time when we are talking about licensing kennels and looking after dogs, it is ironic that we still do not have a licensing system for hospitals in this country.  It is long overdue and it is going to happen.  Everything we are doing is in preparation for that licensing regime.  If the system was in operation today, we know that many of the services in some of our hospitals would not be sustainable and would have to be moved.We are aware of the need to strengthen the ambulance service in the region.  In particular, we are aware of the need to make sure that more things are diverted to hospitals such as Louth County Hospital, so that the community will know that the majority of their health needs can be met in the region.  It is only when we are acutely ill or have a complex health problem that we will need to go to Drogheda or Cavan.  Up to 95% of our health requirements can be dealt with at primary care or in hospitals such as Louth County Hospital.I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I assure him we are mindful of the challenges.  Change is never easy.  I accept what the 24 GPs have said, but I assure him that these decisions are being based on the best clinical evidence available to us.  That is not to suggest that the general practitioners do not provide good clinical evidence, but in this case moving critical care and acute care is based on the advice of the experts in that field.  This is why it is happening now rather than in October, for when it was originally planned.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	I am very pleased to have an opportunity to raise the very important issue of the carer's allowance in the Chamber this evening.  Everybody would agree that it is impossible to overstate the huge importance and the value of the role of carers in Irish society.  In particular, I refer to the role they play and the great social value of the work they do in keeping families together, binding communities and keeping people with disabilities, people with medical problems and older people in their own homes, and helping them avoid the fate of being consigned to nursing homes and surrounded by strangers, even though these may be health care professionals.  People deserve to live in a family environment and should be afforded the dignity of availing of this in their twilight years.Carers also have a very important monetary impact on Irish society.  There are 161,000 family carers in this country at present.  It is estimated that they contribute the monetary equivalent of €2.5 billion to the economy each year through the amount of hours they invest in caring for family members.  We cannot afford to ignore that.Up until a few years ago, it was fairly easy to access the carer's allowance with the requisite certification and letters from a local GP.  Anybody with an essential medical need qualified and was entitled to avail of the allowance for a family member to look after him or her.  That is now not the case and I have met constituents who applied for the allowance but were refused, even though they had a significant medical need.  They applied again and were refused on appeal.  This is not satisfactory because there clearly has been a very significant shift in attitude in the Department of Social Protection.  It has not been explained and has not been adopted as an official position.  My hunch is that the Government is under severe pressure for resources and I think that a decision has been taken to tighten up significantly on the carer's allowance.  The policy appears to be to refuse applications almost universally when they come in.  This is simply not adequate.  The least people deserve is an acknowledgement from the Government that the policy has changed, that the funds are not there and that the carer's allowance is now much more difficult to access.I would like to highlight one case in my constituency which sums up the current situation.  A woman who I shall call Mary — it is not her real name — cares for her aunt on a full-time basis.  She is a full-time carer and her aunt has nine conditions, namely, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, hypertension, asthma, fluid retention and carpal tunnel syndrome.  I have met her in her house and she is severely debilitated.  She is unable to care for herself.  Due to the carpal tunnel syndrome, she has no power in her hands.  She has the use of one baby finger and a baby finger and index finger on her other hand.  She cannot even make herself a cup of tea.  She is taking a huge amount of medicine every day, but she cannot administer that medicine, so her niece is caring for her full-time.  She is in receipt of social welfare but has absolutely no assistance from the State in caring for her aunt.I do not believe it is acceptable that when this woman applied for the carer's allowance she was refused on the basis that her aunt did not fulfil the medical requirements.  That is ludicrous, so she applied a second time but was refused again.  On the second occasion, her GP, who I know well, wrote a letter pleading with the deciding officer and explained that this woman is not capable of caring for herself and that she would be destitute without full-time care from her niece.  She was refused by an unknown deciding officer somewhere in the midlands who based his decision on the fact that she did not meet the medical requirements.  This is catastrophic.  It is unacceptable.  It makes me angry and upset to think that people who are in dire need of assistance to enable them keep people in the community and not surrender them to the State and to State institutions — which is the other alternative and a far more costly one from an economic point of view — cannot be afforded the dignity they deserve by the Government.  Our priorities are all wrong.  It is extraordinary to see a Deputy from the other side of the House take a principled position on stag hunting, which has no bearing on his constituency and in my view has nothing to do with principle, while at the same time he is willing to stand over this type of abuse by the State of people who are in dire need.  I ask the Minister of State to convey that message to the Minister.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the case of the woman she referred to as Mary, although that is not her real name, I will pass them directly to the Minister and ask him to have it investigated.On the broader issue of the difficulties experienced by carers in accessing funding under the carer's allowance, entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  In certain instances people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.  This can lead to additional delays in processing their claims.The most recent processing figures available — May 2010 — indicate that almost 80% of claims for carer's allowance are processed within 12 weeks.  The average time to decide a claim for carer's allowance is eight weeks.  This is similar to processing times in 2009.  At some 35%, the same level of applications were rejected in both years.In 2009, 16,574 new claims were received and 5,776 rejected in the year.   In 2010 to date, 8,959 new claims have been received and 3,153 rejected, representing a 35% rejection rate.  In 2009, some 1,300 appeals were received of which 244, or 19%, were allowed and 570 cases, or almost 44%, were disallowed, 48 cases were partly allowed and 53 cases were withdrawn.  If the person supplies additional information with the appeal the case is re-examined by the deciding officer.  In 2009, 388 cases were revised on the basis of new information.  There are currently 3,608 claims on hand for decision.At the end of December 2009 there were just more than 48,220 people in receipt of carer's allowance, an increase of approximately 11% on the previous year.  Of these some 19,100 are in receipt of half-rate carer's allowance and another social welfare payment.  In addition, more than 1,910 people are in receipt of carer's benefit.The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.  The Department monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring optimum processing times for claims.The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers. It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.During the past decade, carer payment rates have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.People caring for more than one person receive a higher rate of payment, equating to an additional 50% of the maximum personal rate.  Recipients with children also receive a qualified child increase in respect of each child.Following this year's budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 years of age is €212.Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  The carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively.  As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last budget for carers under 66 years of age, the weekly rate of payment for the carer's allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The Government will continue to support carers within the resources available.If the Deputy gives me the details of the case to which she referred, I will pass it directly to the Minister responsible, Deputy Ó Cuív.

The project was unveiled in 2006.  It was held up during that period primarily by objections despite the fact that it was one of the first projects to be fast-tracked under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  It was the subject of two oral hearings by An Bord Pleanála, in both of which the decision was to give the project the go ahead.  There is great concern about the delay regarding the foreshore licence.  We understand it is due to legal details concerning the licence.  We were told in April of this year that it would only take a few weeks to rectify the matter.This project is of huge importance to north Kerry in particular, given that the rate of unemployment in this area as well as west Limerick at approximately 25% is twice the national average rate.  It is hoped that this project will create approximately 400 jobs in the long term, which would be invaluable to this area and community.  It is particularly important given that there has been a haemorrhage of jobs in Tralee and Listowel in north Kerry during the past seven or eight years.  The workforce in that area was very dependent on the construction sector.  That is the reason many young men got work in the construction sector but most of them are now unemployed.We would welcome if the Minister of State could confirm that the legal difficulties delaying this project, which is what we understand are delaying it, would be dealt with speedily and that the project would be given the go ahead.  I stress the importance of this project for north Kerry and west Limerick.  Members of all parties are working collectively to create an environment to enable people to get back to work.

In September 2007 a planning application was lodged with An Bord Pleanála for the terminal.  Permission was granted by the board in March 2008 even though this was a complex application which involved a protracted oral hearing.  However, the process has not been as efficient in respect of the foreshore licence.  Shannon LNG had its first meeting with the engineering division of the foreshore licence section of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 27 August 2007.  It made a formal application for the licence on 2 April 2008, more than two years ago.  Last April, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government confirmed in the House that he had signed off on the licence which would be sent to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for final clearance.  This has not happened to date.This project is of significant national importance in terms of energy security and of great local importance in terms of providing jobs.  As regards energy security, almost 60% of Ireland's electricity is generated using natural gas as fuel.  There is a high level of dependence on gas imports from the United Kingdom, with some 90% of our gas being imported from that country.  Moreover, the United Kingdom itself is projected to have to import up to 79% of its own gas requirements by 2016.  It makes no sense to rely for our supplies on a country whose own resources are running out.  Shannon LNG can provide security and diversity of supply and storage and thus reduce our dependence on one import pipeline from Scotland.There is also a significant local employment aspect to this project.  It is expected that it will provide 350 jobs at any one time over a  four-year period.  There will also be 200 jobs for more than six months relating to the construction of the pipeline.  When the terminal is operational it will provide more than 100 jobs, including some in the broader economy.  If there is a difficulty with regard to the foreshore licence, it must be communicated to Shannon LNG.  If it is a case of expertise not being available to carry out a proper examination of the foreshore licence application, surely such expertise should be assigned to the project as a matter of urgency in view of its strategic importance.

I am very conscious of the economic potential of this project and I hope to throw some light on the matter in my reply.  Following the enactment of the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government assumed responsibility in January 2010 for a range of foreshore functions including all foreshore energy-related developments.The Shannon LNG proposal to construct a liquefied natural gas, LNG, regasification terminal on the Shannon Estuary between Tarbert and Ballylongford in County Kerry was one of a large number of projects for which foreshore applications had been submitted and on which decisions had not been finalised or conveyed to the project promoters prior to the transfer of functions.  This project will involve the construction of an LNG marine import and regasification terminal, and a pipeline connection from the site to the Bord Gáis transmission system.The four foreshore applications made by Shannon LNG in respect of the project were originally made to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in April 2008.  The applications are for consents under the Foreshore Act to construct an LNG jetty that will be used for mooring and offloading LNG tankers; a materials handling jetty for the delivery of construction materials to the site by sea; a sea water intake and outfall required to circulate sea water through heat exchangers for use in the process of warming the LNG and converting it from liquid to gas; and a drainage outfall to discharge surface water, ground water, treated foul water, and used fire water from the proposed development.Following submission of the applications, they were referred to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's expert consultees, all of whom approved of the proposed developments subject to certain conditions.  The applications were also subjected to the usual public consultation procedure, property valuation and deliberation by the marine licence vetting committee, which also recommended approval of the applications subject to the conditions specified by the expert consultees.  All of the specified conditions to be attached to the consents have now been accepted by the applicant.The consent process had not reached a conclusion when responsibility for the applications transferred into the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in January 2010.  However, the Department moved to finalise the consent process as a matter of priority, which required advice from the Attorney General's office on a legal matter.  Following receipt of this advice, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, granted the consents on 20 April 2010.  On 22 April 2010 the Department instructed the Chief State Solicitor's office to draft the necessary and complex legal documents required to give effect to the consents.  Work has been ongoing on this issue and the CSSO has confirmed that the amended drafts of the documents will be available by 1 July 2010, allowing the draft leases and licences to issue to the applicant for their agreement.

The Fund comprises a current account and an investment account.  The Minister for Social Protection manages and controls the current account from which benefit payments are made, while the Minister for Finance, through the National Treasury Management Agency manages the investment account. To the extent that annual income is not required for benefit payments, this finance, together with any accumulated surplus from previous years is transferred to the SIF investment account.Between 1999 and 2007, the fund had a surplus each year, ranging from €256 million in 2003 to €649 million in 2006.  The accumulated surplus rose from €420 million in 1999 to €3,632 million in 2007.  Deficits were recorded in 2008 and 2009, reducing the accumulated surplus to €892 million at the end of 2009.The Fund's accumulated surplus is now exhausted. The operational   deficit of the Fund for 2010 after the utilisation of the accumulated surplus of €892 million is estimated to be €1.55 billion, this will be borne by the Exchequer by means of a subvention from the Oireachtas — Vote 38.It is forecast that the Social Insurance Fund expenditure will exceed its income in each of the years 2011 to 2013, with the deficit continuing to be borne by means of a subvention from the Exchequer.

Firstly, in order to incentivise participation in training and education programmes provided under the Plan rates of jobseeker's payments and associated rates of supplementary welfare allowance are being reduced where a recipient unreasonably refuses to participate in a course of training arranged by this Department or FÁS, or fails to avail of an opportunity to participate in the NEAP.Secondly, the one-parent family payment scheme is being amended with a view, inter alia, to providing lone parents with greater access to education, training and enabling services such as childcare provision in order to acquire the skills that they will need to gain employment.When commenced, these measures will work in tandem with the integration of FÁS functions into the Department of Social Protection and initiatives such as customer profiling, as part of a strongly activation focused welfare system. In addition, the existing rural social scheme and community services programme will shortly transfer to my Department. Taken together these will ensure that long term systemic unemployment and welfare dependency will not take hold. In providing for these measures, we are determined that reductions in jobseeker's payment rates will only apply where there is a clear lack of engagement by the welfare recipient with an appropriate activation intervention. Any decision made in this area will be open to the independent appeals process.In light of increased, demand the Government is now providing, through FÁS, a total of 128,000 training and activation places for the unemployed this year.  This is a substantial increase on the approximate 66,000 places provided last year. There is a wide range of education and training opportunities available through my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and FÁS for lone parents and jobseeker's to strengthen their qualifications and skills base and to thus maximise their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment.When a lone parent claims jobseeker's allowance they will be actively engaged with under the NEAP, with referral to FÁS and access to the range of employment and training services offered by FÁS. They will be supported in this by the new scheme recently announced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This new Childcare Education and Training Scheme will provide free childcare for those attending FÁS and VEC courses.  It is not anticipated that these measures provided for in the social welfare bill will lead to significant additional costs.

Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to prevent long-term dependence on welfare and facilitate financial independence.  The changes to the One-Parent Family Payment that are outlined in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2010, will help the Government to meet this social policy objective.In their submission on the Bill, One Family, refer to issues in relation to rent supplement, to the supports that are required to move lone parents into employment and the issue that jobseeker's allowance is less conducive to combining a welfare payment and part-time work.The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Also, a person on rent supplement who is deemed by a local authority to be eligible to participate in the rental accommodation scheme may engage in full-time employment, subject to satisfying the standard means-test, and may still be paid rent supplement. In relation to childcare, the Government have made a major investment over the last decade in developing a childcare infrastructure which has resulted in some 65,000 childcare places in place this year.There is a wide range of education and training opportunities available through my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and FÁS for lone parents to strengthen their qualifications and skills base and to thus maximize their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment.Lone parents will be supported to participate in education and training by the new Childcare Education and Training Scheme which will provide free childcare for those attending FÁS and VEC courses.  Where a lone parent wishes to combine part-time work and still receive a welfare payment the family income supplement is available.The proposed reform of the One-Parent Family Payment recognises that work, especially full-time work may not be an option for lone parents of young children. However, we believe that supporting parents to participate in education, training and the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well being of themselves and their families.

It encompasses all aspects of pensions, including social welfare pensions, private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.  Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the comprehensive consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper on Pensions.  The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State. It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.A technical implementation group was established in May to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms into operation.  It has held two meetings to date.  In line with the Government decision, the group is chaired by the Department of Social Protection.  The implementation phase is expected to take three to five years.   The implementation group is cognisant of the current and emerging economic condition and will conduct extensive consultation on the many aspects of the framework before presenting final options to Government for decision.  I am very pleased to be hosting a consultation forum in July which will mark the beginning of this process of engagement.The group is developing a communications strategy to ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties are kept informed of the progress being made in implementing the framework.

A key objective of the Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud, and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.The rapidly changing economic environment with large increases in the levels of unemployed poses challenges for the prevention and effective management of fraud and control.  The Department's response to these challenges has been to introduce new measures, which are evidence based, to target control activity at high risk categories of claimants.Multipliers used in assessing control savings estimate the total future savings to the Department of a revocation of or reduction in a payment resulting from a control action.  The multiplier used is based on the average amount of time persons who ceases to claim remain off payments before returning.  This time varies from scheme to scheme.Control Division carry out validation exercises to ensure control savings are recorded correctly.  These involve an examination of the various control savings reported to ensure that savings are being compiled and calculated in the correct manner i.e. in accordance with the guideline for determining control savings.  The methodology is kept under review. I am satisfied that control savings provide valid, useful and comparable measures of progress towards achieving results.A target of €533.3 million was set for control savings in 2010. On the basis of what has been recorded to the end May 2010 control activity has yielded savings of €110.83million. However the work to rule measures in the Department have impacted on the reporting of the value of control activities.The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.

Of those, 10, 798 (or just over 65%) were awarded and 5776 (or just under 35%) were rejected.  In 2010 to date, 8,959 new carer's allowance claims have been received of which 5,806 (almost 65%) have been awarded and 3,153 (just over 35%) rejected.Accurate statistics relating specifically to the outcome of appeals against refusals of carer's allowance are not kept.  However, I have made available to the House, labelled Appendix 1, a table containing an extract from the Annual Report of the Social Welfare Appeals Office 2009, Statistical Trends — Table 3: Outcome of appeals by category 2009.  This table details, in respect of carer’s allowance, the number of appeal cases dealt with in 2009 that were allowed, partly allowed, revised by deciding officer before appeal, disallowed and withdrawn.  It refers to appeals against all types of decisions on carer’s allowance and it should be noted that it refers to carer’s allowance appeals dealt with by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) during 2009.  The full table and further details regarding the work of the SWAO is available on their website www.socialwelfareappeals.ie.Deciding officers working in the department, including those dealing with the carer's schemes, make their decisions in line with the legislation governing the scheme and relevant guidelines and procedures. They receive training for the work they undertake. Their work is checked for accuracy by supervisory staff and all means decisions are checked by a supervisor. When an appeal is received, any new evidence supplied as part of the appeal is re-examined by a deciding officer who, if considered appropriate, will revise his/her decision.  As the Deputy will see from the table in Appendix 1, in 2009 these re-examinations, in the light of new information supplied, resulted in a revised decision in 388 carer's allowance cases.Where a revised decision is not considered appropriate, these cases are checked by a different deciding officer to confirm that the original decision was in accordance with the legislation and, then, forwarded to the SWAO for processing.The Decisions Advisory Office (DAO) of the department has responsibility for ensuring that decisions made on social welfare claims are consistent and of good quality and that customers are notified of decisions in a form which is clear and understandable.  They provide advice and guidance to deciding officers as required.In the interests of consistency and good practice in decision making, regular meetings are held between the SWAO and the DAO. These meeting are a means of providing feedback from the SWAO to the department, and vice versa, as regards issues arising in the course of appeal cases.AllowedPartly allowedRevised DO DecisionDisallowedWithdrawnTotalCarer’s Allowances*2,4418.7%483.7%38829.8%57043.7%534.1%1,303*This includes Carer's Allowance and Carers Benefit.

Processing times can be affected by the requirements of the schemes such as the necessity for a means assessment or it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.  I have made available a table showing the processing times at each local office during May.The total number of jobseeker's awaiting a decision on their claim at 19 June was 48,261 and represents 9% of the total jobseeker claim load nationwide.   As has previously been said in the House, when we look back over several years when the live register was at its lowest, there was always around 9% or 10% of claims awaiting a decision.I think the Deputies will agree that over the past year or more the Department has made huge efforts to reduce processing times and the number of claims awaiting a decision. The current performance should be seen in the context that, in 2009 alone, local offices received over 670,000 jobseeker claims and so far this year they have received over 200,000 claims.I have also made available to the House a table showing the breakdown of jobseeker's benefit (JB) and jobseeker's allowance (JA) claims awaiting a decision at each local office. These data have been compiled from data that is maintained on a local office catchment area basis and the figures do not correspond exactly with county boundaries.I appreciate the importance of getting claims decided as quickly as possible and I want to assure the House that staff in local offices and in the Department's inspectorate are doing all they can to ensure that claims are processed as quickly as possible.  There are still some offices where processing times and claims awaiting a decision are not as good as I would like.  The Department will strive to reduce processing times and the number of claims awaiting a decision even further where we can, either through streamlining processes and procedures further or through the introduction of new technology to assist with claims processing much of which is well in development.JBJAAchill0.120.93Apollo

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	708	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 69 and 79 together.The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents", was published in 2006 and can be viewed at http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/PolicyPublications/Families/ Documents/prop_lp.pdf.It put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, the focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low-income families with young children.The One-Parent Family Payment, by its nature, is not payable where the lone parent is co-habiting with the other parent of the child or with someone else as husband and wife.  The Discussion Paper proposed that the category of lone parenthood would be abolished.  Instead, a parental allowance would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on a low income, thus ending the co-habitation rule.  It will not be possible for my Department to progress this aspect of the proposal due, at present, to the current economic climate.These proposals have, however, informed deliberations regarding the One-Parent Family Payment scheme.  The current One-Parent Family Payment provides long-term income support, until children are 18 years of age, or 22 years of age if in full-time education, to those who are parenting alone — with no systematic engagement with recipients by the State.  At present, lone parents are not required to engage in employment, education or training as a pre-condition to receiving the payment.  Such long-term welfare dependency and passive income support to individuals of working age are not considered to be in the best interests of the recipient, of his or her children or of society in general.Despite significant State spending on one-parent families as well as improvements made to the One-Parent Family Payment over the years, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion and encouraging economic independence.  A large proportion of lone parents and their children continue to experience poverty.Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to:prevent long-term dependence on welfare and facilitate financial independence;recognise parental choice with regard to care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, andinclude an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.To meet these social policy objectives, my Department has introduced changes to the One-Parent Family Payment in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2010 which are being discussed in the Oireachtas at present.These changes will bring Ireland's support for lone parents more in line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	709	During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.Over the past decade, carer payment rates have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.People caring for more than one person receive a higher rate of payment, equating to an additional 50% of the maximum personal rate.  Recipients with children also receive a qualified child increase in respect of each child.Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.   Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008. The Government will continue to support carers within the resources available.

The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.   MABS is now dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in respect of clients who are presenting with multiple creditors and debts.In 2005, MABS dealt with approximately 10,900 new clients.  In 2006 the number was similar with 11,000 new clients seen by the service.  This figure increased to 12,000 and 16,000 in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  The number increased further to 19,000 in 2009.  In the period January to May 2010 some 9,200 new clients have been seen by MABS.  This represents a 9% increase in the number of new clients accessing MABS in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.Statistics on the number of new clients accessing MABS, and the profile of such clients, are compiled on a quarterly basis and can be found on the www.mabs.ie website.In addition the MABS helpline has dealt some 49,700 calls since its launch in October 2007.  Some 12,200 calls have been dealt with to date this year compared with 10,500 for the same period in 2009.The Citizens Information Board, who has responsibility for MABS, is currently compiling information on the waiting times in each MABS office for the end of the 2nd quarter in 2010 which will shortly be posted to the www.mabs.ie website.   Based on latest information available the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is just over 4 weeks.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and, if appropriate, they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. The Department closely monitors the property rental market but has not commissioned any economic study to date.There are currently over 95,500 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of over 58 per cent since the end of 2005. Over 37,800 have been in payment for 18 months or more.The rental accommodation scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 27,240 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005: 14,833 rent supplement recipients to RAS and a further 12,407 recipients to other social housing options.It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly.  In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred in 2008 and 2009; achieving the targets set for RAS transfers for these years. The target established for 2010 is for a further 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.In consultation with the Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers. These include allowing applicants for RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme. Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can seek applicants for social housing support directly from households in long term receipt of rent supplement as part of a of choice-based lettings approach to allocations.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups. The purpose of these Groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.

Facilitators hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office or by other agencies.  Arrangements to see the facilitator can be made by contacting the social welfare local office or the facilitator directly.  In addition, cases are selected and referred to facilitators by employment support section.The service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme.  There are currently 63 facilitators in place, with a further 7 to be appointed, bringing the total in place to 70.In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated.  Facilitators generally have scheduled days when they are available in different locations across our network of offices and people wishing to meet with a Facilitator would be advised to call on one of those days — a centralised appointment system is not maintained. Accordingly waiting times for individual facilitators are not maintained.  Facilitators make every effort to contact all interested customers as quickly as possible.

The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.Legislative provisions in relation to the introduction of the Public Service Card have been included in Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended by Section 32 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007).These specify that the Minister may issue a Public Service Card in the format that he or she deems fit with the person's name, personal public service number, photograph, signature, card issue number and card expiry date to be inscribed on the card.  Provision is also included for the person's name, personal public service number, date of birth, sex, all former surnames (if any) of the person's mother, photograph, signature and card expiry date to be electronically encoded on the card.  In addition, provision is made for any other information that may be prescribed to be either inscribed or electronically encoded on the card.Over the past few years significant progress has been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services. Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.However, in view of the prevailing economic climate the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of last year. A contract was agreed with the managed service provider from early January.The remaining elements of the production project are expected to take several months to complete. Significant preparatory work has to be undertaken including decisions regarding the final design of the card and to develop a secure site for the personalisation of the cards. It will also be necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the management and administration of the cards.  Procurement for this development has commenced.The overall time for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to register all of those to whom it will be issued.Features such as photographs and signatures and electronic card authentication are expected to minimise the rate of fraud and error arising from incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.The Public Service Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card with highly secure cards.  Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card.A further benefit of the Public Service Card will be the efficiencies that can be achieved by all agencies using the card.  The time spent on establishing identity and authentication will be reduced leading to significant potential savings across the whole public sector.

These concerned duration, access to post-graduate courses, appropriateness of courses and progression.  The final shape and scope of such changes are currently being finalised for the 2010/2011 academic year.

The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.A means test is applied to the scheme to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need ensuring maximum value for money.  Apart from a number of exceptions, all household income, including welfare payments are assessable as means under the BSCFA scheme in accordance with the normal assessment for supplementary welfare allowance. The exceptions to these rules are that any income received in the form of family income supplement (FIS), higher level education grants or the first €120 earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature is disregarded for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.BSCFA rates are €200 for children aged 2-11 and €305 for children aged 12-22, an increase of €80 and €115 respectively on the 2006 rates. In addition, the allowance is increased by €215 to €520 per annum payable for eligible 18 year olds, as a compensatory measure where child benefit is no longer payable. In Budget 2009, there was an increase of €50 in the income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  This has brought the income limits for the allowance for couples with one child to €563.60 and €410.10 for those parenting alone.  The limit is increased by €29.80 for each additional child. The Government has provided €82 million for the scheme this year — an increase of €59 million since 2006.The improvements in BSCFA rates in recent years are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  According to the Consumer Price Index for May 2010, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen 12.6% over the past twelve months and by 27.3% since December 2006.  Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 37.8%.I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  I am satisfied that the improvements to the scheme in recent years, (and in particular the scheme improvements relative to the CPI trends), are providing a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with returning to school.  The adequacy of back to school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be kept under review.

These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks each year from end September to end April. In the 2009/2010 heating season over 340,000 recipients benefited from the allowance at a cost of over €231million.Some 376,000 pensioners are receiving the household benefits package which provides 2,400 electricity units per annum (or the gas equivalent) over the year and it is estimated that some 140,000 of these households are receiving the fuel allowance and the electricity units /gas allowance under the household benefits to assist with the heating and other energy requirements. The household benefit package cost €184million in 2009.Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the Housing Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities. Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of €130 million in funding for insulation, €76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area.The Inter Departmental/Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.As part of its work, the Group was asked to make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty. These recommendations will be considered as part of the overall strategy to deal with energy affordability which will include supports for low income households.

At that time, it was expected that inflation for 2009 would be 2.5%.  However, in 2009, prices declined by an average of 4.5%. Budget 2010 provided for reductions in weekly welfare rates of between 3.5% and 4.2% for persons of working age.I fully appreciate that changes made in the welfare area are not easy for people but believe that if the Government had not taken the steps to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances, we would have run the risk of making the economic and social situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients.While there has been some increases in inflation in recent months, consumer prices are back at March 2007 levels. However, the lowest weekly rate of payment for those aged between 25 and 66 is currently over €10 higher than in 2007.Social welfare changes for 2011 will be considered later this year in the context of next year's budget preparations, having regard both to needs, including the impact of movements in prices, and to the resources available to meet those needs.

The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the clients in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.  In 2009 some 2,618 special accounts were set up with the local Credit Unions.Focused training programmes designed to equip money advice staff and local management boards to meet the demands on the services are provided by MABS NDL, the national support company.  The Citizens Information Board, who has responsibility for MABS on behalf of the Department, continues to monitor the training needs of MABS employees to ensure a high quality service is provided.  In addition, MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the services in managing their increased caseloads.  These include a money management education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to a local MABS office or to an appropriate alternative.An operational protocol ‘ Working Together to Manage Debt’ is in place and is the result of almost 2 years work by MABS NDL and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF), the main representative body for the banking and financial services sector.  The protocol applies to all client debts, including mortgage debt owed to the major lending institutions in Ireland and includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan.Last year an additional 19 money advisers were appointed to MABS companies throughout the country.  They have been fully trained in the application of money advice work and the relevant codes and legislation relating to mortgage debt.I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.  I am confident that the money advisers are trained and equipped to deliver this important service to the members of the public who require it.

The statutory role of the Board is to monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act 1990.  This involves the regulation of occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and the provision of advice to the Minister for Social Protection on pension matters generally.The operations of the Pensions Board are financed by annual fees payable to it by occupational pension schemes and by providers of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.  As at 1 June 2010 the Board had 37.6 whole time equivalent permanent positions and one temporary position, giving a total staff complement of 38.6.  I recognise that it is important that the Pensions Regulator has sufficient resources to carry out his functions.  The question of additional resources is currently being examined by the Department of Finance.

In the context of social welfare, the Central Control Section of the Department accepts reports of possible fraud offered by members of the public in relation to the Department's schemes.  Reports are accepted online at www.welfare.ie, by phone or in writing.  All reports investigated are dealt with in confidence.  A member of the public may give details anonymously.The number of anonymous reports from members of the public has increased dramatically in the past year, with over 6,400 reports made at end 2009 compared to approximately 1,000 reports made in 2008.  The number of anonymous reports from members of the public received to the end of May 2010 was 4,397, an increase of 200% on the number of reports in the same period in 2009.  At present whistleblowing legislation is, therefore, not being considered.

In determining whether a customer has refused an offer of suitable employment, Deciding Officers of the Department have regard to these availability and genuinely seeking work conditions particularly.The steps which people are expected to take to seek work will vary from person to person.  In determining whether steps taken to seek employment have been reasonable, the Deciding Officer considers all the circumstances of the case including the nature and conditions of the employment sought, the individual circumstances of the customer and the local economic environment.Particular matters which must be taken into account are the person's skills, qualification and work experience, the period of unemployment, the efforts made in previous weeks to seek employment, the availability and location of job vacancies, and the person's family circumstances.A customer may be regarded as not being available for work if he or she places unreasonable restrictions on the nature of the employment sought, the hours of work, the rate of pay, the duration of the employment, the location of the employment, or any other unreasonable restrictions on the conditions of employment which he or she is prepared to accept.In cases where a Deciding Officer is of the opinion that the person has placed unreasonable restrictions on the nature of employment sought, the person may be interviewed to clarify the position.  The customer may demonstrate that the restrictions are not unreasonable and that he or she has a reasonable prospect of getting full-time work despite such restrictions.These same conditions are also applied in determining whether a person has been made an offer of suitable employment.

In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings. People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men. People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the removal of the State pension (transition), thereby standardising State pension age at 66.  This means that the last group of people to receive the State pension (transition) will be those who reach 65 years of age in 2013.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the National Pensions Framework, which was published on 3 March 2010.   An implementation group chaired by my Department has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.In addition to the changes being made to State pensions, both employees and employers must be encouraged to change their attitudes to working longer. At the workplace level, employers must seek to retain older employees and create working conditions which will make working longer both attractive and feasible for the older worker.  Where this is not possible and people leave paid employment before State pension age, they will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment until they become eligible for a State pension, as is the current situation.

The most recent amendment was introduced by Section 15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009 which provided that only persons who have a right to reside in Ireland can be regarded as being habitually resident in the State.Following the passing of that Act, the operational guidelines of the Department were examined and all necessary changes on foot of this legislation were incorporated and updated on the Department's website on 8 February 2010.The Department's operational guidelines on habitual residence emphasise the need for consistency and any cases of apparent inconsistency which come to notice are examined with a view to ensuring that the guidelines, together with the ongoing support and training resources, adequately address any areas of uncertainty.Regarding the weight given to previous residence in determining habitual residence, the legislation specifically directs the deciding officer to "take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the following:(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;(d) the person's main centre of interest, and(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances."These five specified factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law which examined the concept of habitual residence in the context of social welfare benefits.  The Department's guidelines go on to point out that "No single factor is conclusive. The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case. It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition".  In these circumstances, I have no plans to amend the rules to give greater weight to the length of previous residence.

The research took place during 2009 and a final draft was presented to the Minister for Health and Children in early 2010.  The report was launched by Minister of State, Barry Andrews, T.D. at the annual conference of the Carers Association on 7th May 2010.The purpose of the study was to examine mechanisms through which young carers in Ireland can be identified, to examine the impact of caring on their lives and to examine ways in which they can be assisted. The Study involved a review of the national and international literature, together with a number of interviews with twenty-six young carers and thirty agency staff.The findings suggest that while there may be some negative impacts (such as absences from school or distractedness while at school; feelings of social isolation; physical illness; boredom, worry and resentment) there are a range of positive impacts as well. These included greater connectedness to the person cared for; maturity and compassion.The findings also suggest that young carers need a range of formal and informal support from a variety of services. Examples of those which they received and wanted more of included:Home helpRespite careAdvice and informationSupport from friends and family membersSupports from teachers and school principalsBetter treatment for the person with the care needHelp with transport and home renovations.The particular service areas identified, and the welfare of young carers as children are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and the Health Services Executive, as well as the Department of Education and Skills and the National Educational Welfare Board.The Department of Social Protection provides income supports for adult carers who are unable to work because of their full time caring responsibilities.  It does this through the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant, as well as additional supports such as the household benefits package and free travel.  These supports are generally available to full time carers over the age of 18.  The respite care grant is available to full time carers over the age of 16.While the work of a young carer is clearly important in many families, it would not be in the interests of a child attending school that they be treated as a full time carer in need of income supports in their own right.

This transfer took place in two stages.  From April 2009 new claims have been processed by this Department;  from 1st September claims previously paid by the HSE became the responsibility of this Department.  Some 25,000 children are currently in receipt of DCA.Although the qualifying conditions are the same now as they were previously in the HSE, when the DCA scheme was administered by the HSE, it was done on a local area basis, without legislation, and with significant variations in decisions between HSE areas.  The Department is able to administer the scheme in a more consistent manner.To date the Department has received 4500 claims for DCA, of which 4330 have been decided, with 37 % allowed.  1085 appeals have been received, 68 have been decided to date, with 13 allowed.   The number of appeals allowed is in the order of 20%.  DCA claims are on average decided with 7 weeks in over 85% of cases.As regards the carer's allowance , in 2009 16,574 new claims were received and 5776 rejected in the year. (i.e. 34.8% rejection rate).  In 2010 to date 8,959 new claims have been received and 3,153 rejected (i.e. 35% rejection rate).  There has been almost the same level of rejections in both years.  In 2009 there were 1,303 appeals received.  244 appeals were allowed (18.7%); 48 appeals (3.7%) were partly allowed.  570 cases (43.7%) were disallowed and 53 cases(4.1%) were withdrawn.  If the appeal includes new additional information the case is re-examined by the deciding officer.  In 2009 388 cases (29.8% of appeals) were revised on the basis of new information.   The average time to decide a claim for CA is currently 9 weeks. There are currently 3,608 claims on hands for decision.Persons in receipt of the CA and DCA receive the respite care grant (RCG) automatically on the first Thursday of June without any additional application.  A smaller number of people not in receipt of CA or DCA can apply separately for RCG if they are providing full time care.  Of these the rejection rate is around 20%.  This figure has been consistent for a number of years.Entitlement to carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and respite care grant is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.  The Department monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring optimum processing times for claims.

Financial support for people who have suffered as a result of an emergency event, including extreme weather events is normally addressed through the exceptional and urgent needs payment provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health board payments.   This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income. Assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance, to assist, for example in cases of an extreme weather event with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and shelter. Assistance can be provided to people affected in cash or in kind. There is no automatic entitlement to these payments.  Each application is determined on the particular circumstances of the case.Where a particular event has caused loss and damage to a large number of people on a wide-spread scale and the support required is greater than can be coped with by the usual support mechanisms then humanitarian assistance is considered by the Government.  Humanitarian assistance is designed to provide hardship alleviation assistance, as opposed to compensation, to people affected by an emergency event who are not covered by insurance and is based on an income test.The most recent extreme weather event which led to the Government activating the humanitarian assistance system occurred in November 2009.The HSE's Community Welfare Service has been providing support to households since this flooding occurred. Up to the 21st May 2010 they had made over 3,000 payments to 1,282 individuals to the value of €1.3million throughout the country.  The largest payment to an individual was in excess of €25,000.Most of these payments have been in respect of immediate needs such as clothing, food, bedding and emergency accommodation needs. Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Payments in respect of longer-term needs, such as meeting the cost of repairing homes and making them habitable again, take somewhat longer as homeowners must first establish the cost of repair. As homeowners establish the cost of repair by securing builders' estimates, the extent of the loss is verified, usually by a loss assessor in cases where significant amounts are claimed, and details of the amounts that can be provided under the humanitarian assistance scheme are then sent to the homeowners in question. The HSE are currently in the process of discharging these claims.  I am satisfied that the arrangements have worked well.

It is envisaged that the committee, as part of its deliberations, may invite submissions from interested groups, experts in the field and the public.  I would expect that the committee will make its recommendations within a period of about 6 months.

I would, however, assure the Deputy that the matter will be treated as a priority when the deliberations of the committee are finalised.

Facilitators who are located throughout the country, covering defined geographical areas develop individual progression plans with the customer.   They work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities.In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated.  The facilitator service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme.  Twenty three additional facilitators have been appointed since September 2008 bringing the number currently serving to 63 and a further 7 are due for appointment.A formal targeted programme of activation was introduced under the National Development Plan (NDP) under which the Department actively selects cases for referral to facilitators. Over 22,000 cases were referred to facilitators during 2009.Facilitators may assist welfare recipients with grants under the technical assistance and training scheme up to a maximum of €1,000.  The grant is targeted towards certain business start-up expenses of clients in receipt of the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.  The fund is designed to enhance the person's prospects of succeeding in becoming independent of the social welfare system through support for training in the areas of starting a business, book-keeping/accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training or assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment.  A total of €3.5m was spent under the technical assistance and training scheme in 2009.

BTEA will not be approved if a person holds a qualification equivalent or higher than the qualification for which the application has been received.The potential for further changes in certain areas was identified by my predecessor to the Joint  Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  These concerned duration, access to post-graduate courses, appropriateness of courses and progression.  The final shape and scope of such changes are currently being finalised for the 2010/2011 academic year.

Employees are covered by PRSI classes A, E, H and P, which provide cover for the above benefits as well as for short-term contingencies such as jobseeker's and illness benefits.PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments.  Self-employed people pay Class S contributions at a rate of 3% per annum as compared to the 14.75% full Class A contributions paid by employees and their employers, to reflect the narrower range of benefits they receive.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.A self-employed person who has paid insufficient Class A contributions may instead qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  Jobseeker's allowance is a means-tested payment and, in assessing a person's means, account is taken of all income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year. In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and it is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years.The process also recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.

Following a number of meetings, this Group submitted a set of proposals to Cabinet for discussion and agreement.I believe that those proposals put forward by the Government represent an honest effort to make the working of this House more relevant and more efficient. They set out a new Dáil schedule which would better reflect the normal working day and they accommodate some of the key concerns set out by the Opposition in the various policy documents which they have released on this issue.Upon my appointment as Chief Whip, I have examined the relevant documentation in relation to this issue and have over recent weeks been holding bilateral meetings with the various Party representatives with a view to seeing where realistic progress can be made.

An employer must give notice that the short-time is of a temporary nature.Where an employee has been laid off or kept on short-time, or a mixture of both, either for 4 consecutive weeks or for a broken series of 6 weeks, where all six weeks occur within a 13 week period, an employee may decide to claim redundancy payment by serving a written notice to the employer (Form RP9) stating the intention to claim redundancy and termination of employment. Alternatively, an employee may decide to remain on temporary lay-off pending resumption of employment duties subject to work being available. In both instances, the decision is a matter for the employee.However, an employee who claims and receives redundancy payment due to lay off or short time is deemed to have voluntarily left his or her employment and not entitled to notice under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001.In the case of workers who are laid off for an average period of more than twelve weeks per year prior to redundancy, the provisions relating to lay-off in the Scheme will not apply until the end of that average period.  In the case of a seasonal worker, therefore, there will normally be no question of redundancy arising until the usual commencement time of seasonal work.  If the individual is not re-employed at that point, the question of redundancy may arise, but not until then.In general, redundancy is a situation where an employee's job has been made redundant and the employee is not replaced. The Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, provide that employees, whohave two years continuous service with an employer,are aged 16 years or over, andare in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts,  are entitled to statutory redundancy payment from the employer in the event of being made redundant.Employees are entitled to notice, as per the Minimum Notice Act, prior to termination of employment. If the employer is unable to provide the appropriate notice, it can be paid in lieu.A key issue in respect of selection for redundancy is that the selection process must be seen to be fair and non-discriminatory. It is open to an individual who feels that he/she has been unfairly dismissed by reason of unfair selection for redundancy, to take a case to the Rights Commissioners or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2007 generally apply to any employee who has 12 months continuous service with the employer.

However, the position in relation to State aid is that aid for investment in companies in the various regions of Ireland must be in accordance with the Regional Aid Map 2007-13 approved by the European Commission.   This Map was drawn up in accordance with the Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines. Under the approved Map, neither Limerick nor Kerry currently qualify for regional aid for large investment projects, following the expiry of transitional arrangements at the end of 2008.   Both qualify for regional investment aid to SMEs at a rate of 20% for medium sized companies (50 to 249 employees) and 30% for small companies (under 50 employees).A Mid-term Review of the Regional Aid Maps is currently underway and my Department is in discussion with the EU Commission with a view to effecting such changes as are warranted by the deterioration in economic conditions since the Regional Aid Maps were drawn up.

However, selling goods "to a person at a place where he resides or carries on business" is specifically excluded from the scope of the Act.  Under the Act the regulation of casual trading is the responsibility of the local authority in whose functional area the trading takes place.  Local authorities regulate casual trading under bye laws issued by them under the Act.  The allocation of licences under the Act is a day to day matter for the relevant local authority and I have no direct responsibility for the matter.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	746	At its core, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, provides that a fixed term contract employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of conditions of employment including pay and pensions.  In addition, the Act provides that in the case of a fixed-term employee  recruited after the enactment of the Act, if he or she is employed by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the aggregate duration of such contracts shall not exceed four years after which, if the contract is renewed again, it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration unless the employer has objective grounds for renewing the contracts again on a fixed-term basis.The terms of the Act are applicable in both the private and the public sectors with the exception, in the case of the public sector, of a small number of categories of employees. If a fixed-term employee feels that he or she is being treated less favourably as regards conditions of employment, or if he or she is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration and if his or her employer refuses to concede this, it is open to him or her to refer the matter to a Rights Commissioner for adjudication.  I am satisfied that the protections afforded employees under the terms of the 2003 Act remain relevant.There is no provision in the Act for suspension by Order of any its provisions to take account of a moratorium in public sector recruitment. Matters concerned with the renewal of fixed-term contracts and/or contracts of indefinite duration in respect of individual public sector employees are matters in the first instance for the public sector employer concerned and, as appropriate, the parent Government Department in consultation as necessary with the Department of Finance.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made a number of recommendations addressed directly to my Department.  All of these recommendations have been assessed by my Department and the current status of each one is set out on the table.Eight of the recommendations have been accepted in whole or in part.  Other proposals envisaged by the Special Group, such as the rationalisation of agencies, are quite complex to implement and may require legislative provision if they are to be achieved.  There are also a number of recommendations in the report affecting my Department which require cross-Departmental consideration and/or consideration at Government level.As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for FAS transferred from my Department to the Department of Education and Skills with effect from 1 May this year, and the recommendations made by the Special Group in relation to FAS programmes and services are now a matter for consideration by that Department.The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes has made an important contribution to the Government's overall Budgetary process by independently identifying options for the achievement of savings in public expenditure.  The financial savings resulting from the implementation of recommendations in whole or in part by my Department have been incorporated into my Department's Estimate for this year.  Any further expenditure reductions that may arise from the Report's recommendations will be included in my Department's budget for future years.RecommendationCurrent PositionCreate a single funding stream for all science, technology and innovation activities across all Departments.In the context of Budget 2010, the Minister for Finance announced that the Government was establishing a single funding stream for Science, Technology and Innovation to maximise the efficiency and focus of investment and ensure that Ireland’s effort is strategically targeted on those areas that can achieve greatest impact.The transfer of responsibility and associated funding for the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) and certain other research functions from the Department of Education and Skills to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation from 1 May 2010 represents significant progress in relation to implementing this recommendation.Discontinuation of funding for the Irish Council for Bioethics.The 2010 Estimates made provision for an orderly wind-down of funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Irish Council for Bioethics (ICB) in the course of the year. The then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment agreed with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance that the three staff in the secretariat to the ICB should be seconded to the Department of Health and Children, so that their expertise could be availed of appropriately.The funding allocation that had previously been made available to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the ICB was accordingly transferred to the Department of Health and Children.Any further decisions in relation to the body are a matter for that Department.Reduction in Departmental and agency staff numbersThe Special Group proposed reductions in civil and public service numbers across all of the Department’s programmes.The number of staff serving across the Department and its agencies fell by 322 in 2009 and will fall further this year due to the moratorium on the recruitment of staff.The Department is currently in discussion with the Department of Finance on staffing targets for the years 2010-2012.Consolidate all indigenous enterprise support and sector marketing functions in Enterprise Ireland and the rationalisation the organisations losing functions as appropriate.  EI to deliver consolidated services through 8 offices in line with NSS hubsThe proposal made by the Special Group cuts across a number of Government Departments and agencies.  Detailed consideration of those aspects that concern only the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (regarding, for example, the CEBs) is at an advanced stage.Reduction in Enterprise Ireland’s Capital spendThe Government considered it appropriate to increase Capital funding to Enterprise Ireland over the last two years to enable the agency to support vulnerable but viable companies, through, for example, the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund.Reduction of IDA’s capital and administrative costs including rationalisation of regional offices in Ireland and shared services.IDA’s capital allocation is directly related to its contractual commitments.IDA’s administrative costs have been reduced by €2.6 million for 2010 compared to the 2009 Estimate provision. This has been achieved through pay and efficiency savings.It is not clear what savings would accrue from a rationalisation of regional offices.Efficiency saving in administration and programme prioritisation in Enterprise Ireland.Enterprise Ireland’s administrative budget has been reduced by €7.9 million for 2010 compared to the 2009 Estimate provision.  This has been achieved through pay and efficiency savings.The rationalisation of IDA and Enterprise Ireland overseas offices.The agencies already share office space in most common locations.Reorganisation of Shannon Development.Consideration of this recommendation is on-going in the context of the special requirements of the Mid West Region in the aftermath of the Dell closure.  Any reorganisation of Shannon Development would require approval by the Government.Reorganisation of Forfás.The Special Group’s proposal was that Forfás’s existing shared services function (carried out on behalf of a number of agencies) should be relocated to a wider Shared Services operation.The implementation of this recommendation would be contingent on the identification of another body which provides shared services functions more efficiently than Forfás.In the absence of the identification of such a body, the Department requested Forfás to examine the possibility of achieving savings through an enhancement of their existing shared services arrangements and this process is under way.Privatise the Certification Service of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.The Special Group’s proposal was to privatise the NSAI’s Certification Services.Having considered the recommendation in detail, it was not clear that any benefit would accrue to the taxpayer from such a move, because of the high level of overhead costs that would remain with the NSAIafter a sale of the certification business. The more likely result would be increased Exchequer cost. Accordingly, it has been decided not to pursue this proposal at this time.The relocation of all Industrial Relations institutions to a single location.The Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and the Rights Commissioner services are currently located in Tom Johnson House in Dublin.The Office of Public Works and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have been requested to facilitate the location of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the same premises.Merging the Health and Safety Authority and the National Employment Rights Authority into one Work Place Inspectorate.Further examination of this proposal suggests that:

there are radical differences between the natures of the two inspectorates;

overlaps between the two Agencies are minimal;a merger will not yield appreciable savings;substantial legislative change would be required.On that basis, it is not proposed to proceed with this recommendation.  However, both agencies are, under the aegis of the Department, developing a programme of practical co-operation designed to make most efficient and effective use of their overall resources, whilst having regard to their different remits.Merging the functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies (RFS) and Companies Registration Office (CRO).The two offices and their statutory functions are already the responsibility of the same public official. Proposals relating to the future of the Registry of Friendly Societies and its statutory functions will be submitted to Government shortly.IAASA should maximise shared services and reduce the Exchequer’s intervention from 40% to 20%IAASA is endeavouring to maximise the use of shared services, but scope for savings is minimal.  The Department currently provides payroll services to the Authority.The level of Exchequer subvention is provided for in legislation and any reduction in this subvention would require detailed policy assessment and legislative change.Savings in corporate services, a reduction in administrative budget and a transfer of foreign posts to Brussels to reduce travel and subsistence spendSavings of €1 million in the Administrative Budget were delivered in the 2009.  Further savings will be achieved in 2010.There are costs associated with the assignment of posts to Brussels (e.g. Rent Allowance).  Having analysed the proposal, the Department does not believe that the recommendation would be efficient or achieve economies in an overall context.Merging the Irish Takeover Panel with the Competition AuthorityThis merger could lead to unnecessary policy conflict and it would not be in line with best international practice.

The Loughrea area is reviewed on a regular basis. The individual State development agencies are promoting the former CIGNA facility and are also available to any potential investors to discuss opportunities within the Loughrea area.More generally, IDA Ireland's strategy for the West region is to:Support the growth and development of the Region's existing clients by working with them to increase their strategic importance through additional functions and activities.Market the West region to overseas clients in order to secure new Greenfield investment.Strengthen the West Region's product offering by working with relevant partners, including Local Authorities, third level institutions and service providers to enhance the region's ecosystem.Provide property solutions with supporting infrastructure to attract foreign direct investment.There are 48 IDA supported companies in Galway City and County, employing 8,912 in permanent jobs and a further 912 are in temporary and contract employment.Galway has over the years attracted significant investment from multinational medical technology firms.  IDA supported medical technology companies now account for over c.5,800 employees. Such companies include Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Beckman Coulter, Covidien, Merit Medical and Transitions Optical. A significant number of these clients have R&D activities based in the region.Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that creating and maintaining employment in County Galway has been and remains a priority for the Government and the State development agencies.

In terms of civil law, of course, compensation in relation to disability or ill-health arising from workplace situations is generally held to be a matter between individual employees and their employer. To the extent that there may be any options for the family by way of State support, I would suggest that the best option may be to pursue the matter with the Minister for Social Protection.   I have passed the details to the Minister for Social Protection for follow up directly with the Deputy.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	750	In October 2006, the Government announced its intention to continue to restrict access to the Irish labour market for nationals of Romania following their accession to the EU on 1 January 2007.  Accordingly, Romanian nationals continue to require a permit to take up employment in Ireland.  However, those already in the State on a valid employment permit for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer at the relevant date of 31 December 2006 would not need an employment permit.  Romanian nationals entering the workforce after 1 January 2007 required an employment permit for a 12 month period after which they would have free access to the labour market.The first phase of the transitional arrangements on free movement for Romanian workers ended on 31 December 2008.  The Tánaiste announced, at that time, that the Government had decided to continue to require that nationals of Romania apply for employment permits in order to participate in the Irish labour market, but that preference would be given to them over nationals of non-European Economic Area countries.The considerable challenges posed as a result of the downturn in the global economic environment, and the direct impact on our labour market, were key factors influencing that decision. The Government formed the view that it would be prudent to focus on maintaining stability in the Irish labour market and avoiding the potential imbalances caused by additional migratory inflows to the country.Ireland is one of 10 Member States to continue to apply restrictions on Romanian access to its labour market.  All Member States that continue to restrict labour market access can end these restrictions at any time during the second phase.   In principle, full free movement of workers should apply after the end of the second phase (31 December 2011).  Member States can only maintain restrictions thereafter if there is a serious disturbance (or threat thereof) to the labour market.  All restrictions for workers from Romania must be lifted by 31 December 2013 at the very latest when full free movement of workers will apply across the 27 EU Member States.I can advise the Deputy that Ireland's economic migration policies are kept under regular and ongoing review having regard to potential impacts and the stability of the domestic labour market.Full details of the current employment permit requirement for Romanian nationals can be found on the Department's website at:http://www.deti.ie/labour/workpermits/bulgariaromania.htm.

My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses. Available State funding for business start-ups would be accessed through either of these Agencies.The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector i.e. businesses which employ 10 or less workers. The CEBs, through both financial and non-financial assistance, support the sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and they must always consider any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from the provision of assistance to a proposed enterprise. The priorities for the CEBs in 2010 are to assist owner/managers in enhancing the survival and sustainability of their businesses in these difficult economic times and to assist people wishing to start their own business including those made redundant. Potential entrepreneurs are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their business needs with their local Board.  Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: www.enterpriseboards.ieThe remit of Enterprise Ireland is to support start-ups that have the potential to employ more than 10 and achieve €1m in exports. These are start-ups that are typically highly innovative and are in a position to sell globally from their earliest stage. While the performance of established businesses is vital to the economy, the flow of innovative high potential start-up enterprises into the Irish economy is equally critical for future growth and stimulating the flow of new High Potential Start-ups (HPSUs) and supporting their growth is one of the fundamental policies within Enterprise Ireland's overall strategy for indigenous industry. The main mechanism for funding HPSU clients is through an Innovative HPSU funding offer. EI's funding contribution is in the form of equity towards the implementation of a business plan. The size of EI's contribution will be based on the company's growth potential, the achievement of milestones and value for money criteria. For more information please see www.enterprise-ireland.com.

I have stated before that the impact of the tax on passenger numbers is being overstated.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, although there are no full time Customs staff stationed at Ireland West Airport Knock, Revenue's Customs enforcement staff attend at the airport very regularly from other nearby locations.Attendance by Customs officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators. Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  A drugs detector dog is frequently used.  Flights with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating attract particular interest.  Attendances by Customs officers cover the full range of flight times and are kept under constant review, in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increases at the Airport.During the first 5 months of 2010, Customs staff regularly visited Knock Airport and 259 flights carrying 27,006 passengers were profiled and examined. The new Revenue drug detector dog was in attendance for almost all of these flights and screened over 23,000 passengers. The number of bags checked by the dog is estimated at 40,000, to include hand luggage as well as checked-in luggage. Use is also made of X-ray equipment in the arrivals terminal. Two seizures of Cannabis Resin and seven seizures of Herbal Cannabis were made. Three seizures of fiscal duty goods were also made — two seizures of cigarettes and one seizure of spirits.The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the current arrangements and resources are sufficient for the control of Ireland West Airport Knock.

It is unclear as to what precise measures it is considered that Sweden is proposing to introduce.  While the taxation of tobacco products is governed by EU Directives, Member States tend on an ongoing basis to make their own decisions about the taxation of tobacco products within overall EU guidelines. In that context it has to be recognised that Ireland has the highest prices and excise duty levels for cigarettes in the EU.  Ireland also applies a high specific (fixed) duty element and low ad valorem element in setting its excise duty for cigarettes relative to other Member States. It is intended to continue that approach in setting our excise duty for cigarettes.

CPO relief was a type of "rollover relief" which meant that the tax due on a gain could be partly or fully deferred if the consideration for the disposal of the asset was reinvested.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.The Deputy will be aware that Finance Act 2010 provides that CGT on the disposal of land under a CPO is not payable until the CPO proceeds had been received by the former land owner.  Previously, only farmers could pay CGT on this basis and other landowners had to pay the CGT on a CPO on either the date the authority with compulsory purchase powers entered on the land or the date the proceeds were received, whichever is the earlier.I have no plans to re-introduce "rollover relief" but all potential taxation measures are constantly examined in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.

Article 78 of EU Council Directive 2006/112/EC provides that the taxable amount shall include "taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself".Accordingly, it is correct to include any carbon tax element of a utility bill in the amount on which VAT is chargeable.

The table provides a breakdown of numbers at visitor attraction sites operated by the Office of Public Works.Site NameJanFebMarAprMayTotal:200820092010200820092010200820092010200820092010200820092010200820092010Altamont Gardens1,2241,1651,6225,8505,3416,4674,3335,5274,8403,9015,2666,2477,2067,4597,44922,51424,75826,625Ardfert Cathedral00000277201125185887835386431,106623769Athenry Castle000000350007594436091,1881,2369612,2971,6791,570Aughnanure Castle0000001312001,8041,6671,6352,7823,2732,9295,8984,9404,564Ballyhack Castle000000000000000000Barryscourt Castle0000000000000146001460Battle of the Boyne087056601,209107802,6222,13803,7452,7236,0535,2344,9906,05313,68011,495Blasket Centre122011802011761,2567004882,5972,1771,8455,2075,7026,0629,1828,7808,689Boyle Abbey000000230003945064417049711,00813281,4771,449Visitor Centre1,3741,5171,2162,0141,5051,7743,2912,7682,4372,8593,1112,0973,8653,9853,54813,40312,88611,072Knowth0000002,057003,4693,6932,9576,6437,1555,85012,16910,8488,807Newgrange4,1654,0962,6784,9724,5585,04810,2439,0537,2118,87110,0969,45313,30015,34714,25641,55143,15038,646Brú  Na Bóinne Total:5,5395,6133,8946,9866,0636,82215,59111,8219,64815,19916,90014,50723,80826,48723,65467,12366,88458,525Carrowmore0000001,141001,4361,4821,2122,7143,4032,7475,2914,8853,959Casino Marino00346000300180290006037447801,1937621,126Céide Fields1270762199241,5472742131,8871,8881,6842,7472,9142,9846,2145,2454,981Charles Fort1,5701,1161,2881,9222,0291,9984,7723,3702,7824,1964,4774,2885,4816,2356,15517,94117,22716,511Clonmacnoise1,5451,4821,1292,3102,3362,0426,8035,3244,8149,2399,2967,06817,40918,04716,86337,30636,48531,916Corlea Trackway Visitor Centre000000218003804884485907907871,1881,2781,235Derrynane House000002460100635971826791,8552,6922,4372,4522,9743,425Desmond Castle000000411001,17762383813451,6671,4072,9332,2902,245Desmond Hall000000000000046111046111Donegal Castle3903753376314045072,1791,0136592,5252,3931,9133,5064,2135,0509,2318,3988,466Dublin Castle6,5995,5006,3417,5996,1535,97811,19611,5798,26010,4649,9908,94010,28014,03310,17146,13847,25539,690Site NameJanFebMarAprMayTotal:200820092010200820092010200820092010200820092010200820092010200820092010Dún Aonghasa9831,0281,0541,9121,8521,3915,2714,6413,9907,4267,4776,74012,91512,58912,95728,50727,58726,132Dungarvan Castle0000000000000836008360Dunmore Cave5083182731,1056306142,2021,5601,1072,4412,1111,9263,1582,8632,5219,4147,4826,441Emo Court000000202003685925156671,0398531,2371,6311,368Ennis Friary0000002880074560601,4101,34102,4431,9470Ferns Castle000000000000363122265363122265Garinish Island0000001,274002,6692,7122,4337,4717,2966,54311,41410,0088,976Glebe House and Gallery0000001,2350001,4611,42463144001,8661,9011,424Glendalough Visitor Centre1,3211,2455211,6341,5001,5656,0665,8134,2967,9646,7704,82010,98510,6739,56627,97026,00120,768Hill of Tara0000000000001,7375245541,737524554J F Kennedy Arboretum1,1871,5162,3042,4763,2842,9934,0795,1432,9392,7004,9516,5538,3668,1378,52218,80823,03123,311Jerpoint Abbey2242146848729824712837926871,6431,4401,1992,7733,0092,6086,4105,7534,809Kilkenny Castle2,5992,0553,7963,8622,9666,8618,8808,3779,46110,03514,21813,23114,01518,60519,76039,39146,22153,109Kilmainham Gaol13,18210,50311,51716,7211513015,90127,89821,51917,71424,07325,05120,38224,18330,20827,755106,057102,41193,269Listowel000001200000001541760154188Loughcrew0000000000000028800288Main Guard00134001316980375746544206848017181,9561,4551,440Maynooth Castle000000000000082216082216Mellifont Abbey0000000000003,21002,524321002,524Newmills Corn and Flax Mills0000000000002082020820Ormond Castle000000000005191009811,0211009811540Parke’s Castle000000886009511,0688151,3971,9981,8403,2343,1142,655Pearse Museum066070709261,07201,6292,10801,2771,58001,443170405,9357,171Pearse’s Cottage00000059000234125010510059339225Phoenix Park1,6501,7152,5822,0522,2663,6734,5573,9064,1568,4803,0173,47022,8194,6014,37039,55815,50518,251Portumna Castle0000001,075008711,0841,1022,0521,8211,6203,9982,9052,722
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	762	As indicated by my predecessor in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 170 to 175 of 4 December 2007, the precise information the Deputy seeks is not available. However, on the same basis as the information supplied at that time, the Revenue Commissioners have provided an update of the data for 2007 and 2008 in the tables below. Information for 2009 is not yet available.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the exact information sought for all taxes on a county basis is not available. Revenue Sheriffs, County Registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt within certain geographical boundaries known as a "bailiwick" which equates geographically with "county". Data on the net receipts of most taxes can be linked to bailiwicks to provide an estimated breakdown of receipts on a county basis.The following tables set out the estimated breakdown of net receipts for Income Tax (PAYE & non-PAYE), VAT (Domestic), Corporation Tax, and Capital Gains Tax. Basic data is not recorded in such a manner as would enable a breakdown by county to be provided in respect of the yield from Stamp Duties, Capital Acquisitions Tax (including Inheritance Tax), Customs, Excise and VAT at the point of Import.In considering the data it should be noted that the amount of tax attributed to a county may not necessarily be an indication of economic activity in that county for any of the following reasons:1. The liability of a trader to VAT is generally dealt with by reference to the location of the trader's registered office even though the economic activity may be carried on in another county.2. An employer's liability for PAYE is normally attributed to the county in which wages and salaries are paid, even though the employees may work in different counties.3. Companies are associated on the tax record with the county address of the head-office or branch with which contact is established for tax purposes, which may be different to the city or county addresses of other branches. The distribution of corporate tax between regions can also vary from year to year as companies relocate.4. Self-employed persons are associated on the tax record with the address at which the business is located, which may be in a different county to the home address.As regards data for 2009, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the necessary detailed information which would provide a basis for estimating the breakdown of yields in 2009 from Income Tax, VAT, Capital Gains Tax and Corporation Tax is not as yet sufficiently complete or reliable to enable such an estimate to be provided at this time.Income TaxCountyPAYEnon-PAYEVAT (domestic)Corporation taxCapital Gains tax€m€m€m€m€mCarlow73.0836.1287.5116.4237.83Cavan101.6833.69131.9957.6731.61Clare166.9760.77127.24117.2347.58Donegal95.4066.85161.4531.4065.39Galway467.61178.59396.05122.99154.17Kerry358.5892.97186.2738.0649.55Kildare312.48149.85434.99185.95170.40Kilkenny172.4360.71139.8425.9931.31Laois48.6239.0391.6714.1534.49Leitrim75.8812.5727.764.035.66Limerick347.77116.94309.59157.9875.52Longford34.7617.2940.6514.8915.26Louth139.6756.11246.4485.0777.31Mayo114.3168.93169.6745.8241.53Meath208.56136.43270.96120.73133.57Monaghan50.3626.8585.1917.1220.44Offaly125.2040.7798.3223.8530.07Roscommon35.9527.5472.6310.1919.24Sligo104.7330.9262.9126.7628.95Tipperary138.26100.34212.19106.7349.17Waterford149.4373.72146.4963.4549.56Westmeath525.2252.05150.0227.3658.56Wexford127.1296.75201.5854.7197.96Wicklow156.25118.31196.8471.64110.45Dublin5,073.301,324.677,162.404,169.331,282.51Cork829.03369.261082.87573.90275.81Other/foreign121.8338.96684.95209.98103.48Totals10,154.5134,27.0012,978.496,393.393,097.38Income TaxCountyPAYEnon-PAYEVAT (domestic)Corporation taxCapital Gains tax€m€m€m€m€mCarlow68.2433.3774.8217.9310.09Cavan100.1531.51120.1921.0312.30Clare164.8351.58113.10139.6439.61Donegal91.4059.90146.2729.7932.55Galway455.10140.02343.16116.2765.26Kerry342.1986.14165.9244.4128.14Kildare303.06126.05406.84114.8173.26Kilkenny174.0157.70129.9226.5025.50Laois40.8935.7581.8710.6310.98Leitrim82.3911.4525.445.082.42Limerick334.43123.31285.99218.3631.02Longford32.4716.5134.276.885.02Louth141.6557.44212.8879.2319.79Mayo104.0661.88148.3133.9420.36Meath196.16110.27247.7652.4349.25Monaghan48.4535.6473.9017.2222.98Offaly141.4335.8383.8631.3012.94Roscommon32.1925.7869.397.526.49Sligo102.3929.3555.9027.2942.31Tipperary138.4494.15200.9499.4033.72Waterford137.9768.10130.5362.1921.59Westmeath542.2552.58121.5917.9417.67Wexford118.2583.56179.1944.7038.07Wicklow160.78105.45182.7965.5757.16Dublin5,092.791,212.306,713.003,166.54584.23Cork806.99344.751065.79388.43108.60Other/foreign116.0436.63651.71226.4252.61Totals10,069.003,127.0012,065.315,071.451,423.93
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	763	The Consumer Credit Directive establishes a harmonised legal framework in the European Union for the provision of consumer credit ranging from €200 up to €75,000. It does not apply to mortgages. It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU.The Directive was transposed into domestic legislation by Statutory Instrument No. 281/2010 on 9 June 2010 and came into operation on 11 June 2010.I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection and, as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.However, following consultation with representatives of the credit union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive. Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11 December 2011 after which date the full Directive will take effect.In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, the Regulatory Reserve Ratio, which imposes solvency requirements on credit unions, has been in place for all credit unions since 30 September 2009.  From that date, all credit unions are required to maintain a Regulatory Reserve Ratio of not less than 10 per cent. The Regulatory Reserve Ratio is the amount held in the Total Regulatory Reserve of a credit union expressed as a percentage of the Total Assets of a credit union. The Total Regulatory Reserve comprises of the Statutory Reserve and, where relevant, an amount held in a non-distributable additional regulatory reserve account.   A minimum of 8 per cent of total assets must be held in the statutory reserve and the remaining 2 per cent may be held in the statutory reserve or additional regulatory reserve account.  The maintenance of adequate levels of reserves is prudent, particularly in the current economic environment, and credit unions are expected to operate with a level of reserves above the minimum regulatory requirement and to comply with the requirements issued by the Registrar of Credit Unions.

The cost of maintaining and managing Heritage Properties amounted to €11.692m in 2009 (excluding pay). Costs of €20.444m (excluding pay) were incurred on maintenance works for Government Departments.2 The Central Bank & Financial Services Authority do not publish a breakdown of.  expenses relating to the Banks head office, the Printworks and the Mint Operations. The maintenance cost figure not only covers building maintenance but also includes a variety of expenses such as security by the army and the Gardaí at the currency production operation in Sandyford.3 Also includes State Claims Agency, National Pensions Reserve Fund, National Development Finance Agency and National Assets Management Agency.4 The Special EU Programmes Body has three offices based in Belfast, Omagh and Monaghan.  Whilst not under the direct ownership of the Department of Finance, the Department is responsible for the part funding of property costs incurred by the Special EU Programmes Body. In 2009 the Department of Finance paid €15,120 towards maintenance and repair costs and €4,480 towards heating, light and fuel costs.

To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;(c) be without both hands or without both arms;(d) be without one or both legs;(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.Further information on family members of a person in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate is available in the VRT 7 leaflet on Revenue's website: www.revenue.ie.The Disabled Drivers and the Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, [Par10(5)(a)] states, "in exceptional circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners may waive the condition concerning residency of a claimant”.  In this regard, evidence is sought that the qualifying vehicle is used on a regular basis for the transport of the disabled person. Each case is evaluated on an individual basis and, where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a qualifying disabled person is transported on a regular basis, the relief is granted. That normally means that the disabled person is transported once per week on average.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	767	Section 73 of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA may set a date by reference to which the market value of a bank asset or property is to be determined. The NAMA Board has set this date as 30 November 2009. It follows that any property price changes after 30 November 2009 will not be reflected in the NAMA market valuations. Commercial property price indices suggest that prices in Ireland may have experienced a small decline since November 2009 but prices in the UK, which has about one-third of the assets underlying the NAMA loan portfolio, rose by a greater percentage. The overall impact, on a weighted average basis, is estimated to be broadly neutral.The valuation date was set in advance of the voluntary application by the banks to be designated as participating institutions. Any change made now to the initial valuation date would create inconsistency between the valuation placed on assets already transferred as part of the first tranche and those transferred in subsequent tranches.  It must be remembered that the European Commission on 26 February 2010 approved the approach taken in establishing NAMA and the valuation methodology adopted.  A change to the valuation methodology would necessitate a new notification to the Commission, and a new decision by the Commission on whether or not to approve it.  This would cause unnecessary and undesirable delay, and result in little or no gain.  What is most important now is that NAMA completes the transfer of the eligible bank assets and meets the demanding deadlines it has been set.

A company must apply to the Revenue Commissioners if they wish to operate such an ESOT.    The Revenue Commissioners will only approve the ESOT where all the necessary conditions specified in the legislation are complied with.All the ESOTs approved by the Revenue Commissioners to date work in conjunction with an Approved Profit Sharing Scheme (APSS) under which eligible employees may receive shares free of income tax.  The legislation governing APSSs is contained in Chapter 1 of Part 17 and Schedule 11 to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  As in the case of an ESOT, the Revenue Commissioners will only approve an APSS where all the necessary conditions specified in the legislation are complied with.Where the trustees of an approved ESOT transfer shares to the trustees of an APSS for distribution to eligible employees, the employees may receive shares free of income tax to the value of up to €12,700 per annum.  To receive the shares free of income tax they must have been held for a period of not less than 3 years.  The time the shares are held in the ESOT is included for the purpose of this three-year period. In certain limited circumstances, and on a one-off basis only, shares to the value of €38,100 may be received free of income tax.  The same three-year retention period is required.ESOTs and APSSs are employee financial participation schemes and the tax relief provided for such schemes is given with a view to fostering partnership at the level of the enterprise. In its recent review of the tax system, the Commission on Taxation recommended that the above schemes be continued.The provisions governing ESOTs and APSSs can, of course, be altered by the Oireachtas.

These are set out in the following table:Schemes20072008Urban Renewal3,5013,271Town Renewal1,128965Seaside Resorts1,2311,051Rural Renewal2,8072,634Multi-storey car parks147136Living over the Shop9381Enterprise Areas137138Park & Ride3319Holiday Cottages832833Hotels1,8931,966Nursing Homes687725Housing for the Elderly/Infirm166179Hostels2421Guest Houses810Convalescent Homes2733Qualifying (Private) Hospitals325330Qualifying Sports Injury Clinics5958Buildings used for childcare purposes420511Mental Health Centres64Student Accommodation941790Registered Caravan ParksN/A10The information available on the numbers of claimants is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers (Form 11) and corporation tax returns filed by companies for the years 2007 and 2008, the latest year for which this information is available.It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2007 and 2008 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies for both years. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.I have also been given information by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to when a building can qualify for allowances. This depends on the particular scheme or type of building. In general, buildings that are to be used for commercial purposes in the various area-based schemes, such as the Urban Renewal Scheme, can qualify for allowances in a number of ways. In the case of an initial allowance (i.e. an accelerated up-front allowance), the allowance is given for the chargeable period in which the expenditure is incurred or, in the case of a lease, the chargeable period in which the tenancy commences. Annual allowances are given when the building is in use for the purposes of a trade or profession or, in the case of a lease, when the building has been let on bona fide, arm's length commercial terms. Thus, it is not necessary in all cases that the building be occupied for a specific purpose before allowances are given.In general, in the case of the sectoral schemes, such as hotels, nursing homes and hospitals, the building has to be in use for a specific purpose before allowances are given. This is the case whether the building is occupied by an owner-operator or is leased. However, in the case of residential units associated with registered nursing homes, the allowances can be claimed when the units have been leased to the nursing home for onward leasing to the elderly or infirm tenants.In the case of residential buildings, ‘section 23' type relief and the relief under the Countrywide Refurbishment scheme are given when the building has been leased, while owner-occupier relief is given when the building is occupied by the owner of the building.SchemesInitial AllowanceWhen allowances given

Section 23 relief (incl Student Accommodation)NoBuilding letOwner-Occupier reliefNoBuilding occupied by ownerCountrywide RefurbishmentNoBuilding letThe Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the information requested by the Deputy in relation to property tax relief. The information is presented in tabular format. Because there are significant differences in the operation of tax relief between the commercial and residential schemes separate tables have been used in relation to the ‘non-cost' elements of the schemes.Table 1 contains the commercial schemes,Table 2 contains the residential schemes, andTable 3 contains composite figures for both commercial and residential relief in relation to the cost of the schemes to the Exchequer.The Commissioners have also made some general points that should be noted when interpreting the tables.The termination dates are the dates by which the construction or refurbishment work on a building has to be carried out if the expenditure that is attributable to that work is to qualify for tax relief. Where a building is not completed by the termination date the expenditure attributable to any construction or refurbishment work that takes place after this date cannot qualify for tax relief. There are no set dates by which a person has to acquire a tax incentive property in order for tax relief to start to be claimed. Tax relief can only start to be claimed after a building has been completed and the building leased or owner-occupied for the purposes required by the particular scheme. Once a building has been leased or owner-occupied and is in use for the required purpose, tax relief can be claimed over varying periods. In addition, the rate at which the available tax relief can be used up depends on the particular taxpayer having sufficient taxable income in any year to absorb the relief. Any unused relief (with the exception of that for residential owner-occupier relief) can be carried forward indefinitely until it has been absorbed. Thus, it is not possible to provide an indication of the final year in which tax relief under these schemes will be claimed as the start year for relief can vary from building to building and the relief period applicable likewise can vary within some of the schemes and between different taxpayers.At this stage the only scheme that is still open to new entrants is the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme. New entrants have until 31 May 2012 to submit project applications for approval in principle. Expenditure on approved projects under this scheme that is incurred before 31 May 2015 can qualify for capital allowances. The scheme for Specialist Palliative Care Units has not yet been commenced. When the Commencement Order is made, the commencement date will be made retrospective to 13 March 2008.SchemesStart DateTermination Date (Note 1)Writing Down Period (years)Double Rent Deduction (Yes/No)Annual AllowanceFree Depreciation (max limit) (Note 2)Initial Allowance (first year only)Urban Renewal 19941/8/199431/12/199814Y4%/2% (Note 3)50%25%Customs House Dock25/1/198830/06/200013Y4%100%50%Temple Bar Area6/4/19915/4/199914Y4%/2% (Note 4).100%/50% (Note 5)50%/25% (Note 6)Seaside Resorts1/7/199531/12/199911Y5%75%50%Enterprise Areas1/8/199431/12/200020 (Note 7)Y (Note 8)4%50%25%/50% (Note 9)Urban Renewal 19991/8/199831/07/200814N4%50%50%Multi-storey Car Parks (Note 10)1/7/199531/07/200814Y (Note 11)4%100%50%Town Renewal6/4/200131/07/200814N4%50%50%Rural Renewal1/7/199931/07/200814N4%50%50%Living over the Shop6/4/200131/07/200814N4%50%50%Park and Ride1/7/199931/07/200814N4%100%50%Third Level Buildings1/7/199731/07/20087N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/AQualifying Sports Injury Clinics15/5/200231/07/20087N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/AHotels (Note 12)27/1/1994N/A7 (now 25)N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/ASchemesStart DateTermination Date (Note 1)Writing Down Period (years)Double Rent Deduction (Yes/No)Annual AllowanceFree Depreciation (max limit) (Note 2)Initial Allowance (first year only)Childcare Facilities2/12/199831/03/20127N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7100% (Note 13)100% (Note 14)Holiday Cottages1/7/196831/07/200810N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/ANursing Homes3/12/199730/06/2011N715% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/AHousing for elderly/infirm25/3/200230/04/20107N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/AConvalescent Homes2/12/199830/06/20117N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/AQualifying Hospitals15/5/200231/12/20137N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/AQualifying Mental Health Centres23/1/200730/06/20117N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/ASpecialist Palliative Care UnitsScheme still awaiting Commencement Order (note 15)N/A7N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/ASchemesStart DateTermination Date (Note 1)Writing Down Period (years)Double Rent Deduction (Yes/No)Annual AllowanceFree Depreciation (max limit) (Note 2)Initial Allowance (first year only)Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme1/6/200831/05/20157N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/ARegistered Guest Houses & Holiday Hostels3/2/2005N/A25N4%N/AN/ARegistered Holiday Camps27/1/1994N/A (Note 16)7 (now 25)N15% p.a. in first 6 years, 10% in year 7N/AN/ARegistered Caravan & Camping Sites1/1/2008N/A25N4%N/AN/ANotes to Table 1(1) The termination date is the date by which qualifying construction/refurbishment expenditure must be incurred, not the date by which a building must be completed/sold or relief claimed.(2) Free depreciation (i.e. the ability to claim more than the basic annual rate of allowances for a single year or over a period of years) is available to owner/occupiers but not to lessors.(3) Under the 1994 Urban Renewal Scheme a maximum of 50% of qualifying expenditure incurred on commercial projects could be written off.  The annual allowance for such projects was 2% per annum.(4) Under the Temple Bar Area scheme the emphasis was on refurbishment rather than construction.  Refurbishment projects in general qualified for 100% write off of the capital expenditure incurred at the higher 4% rate of annual allowance.  For most types of construction projects, only 50% of the qualifying expenditure could be written off at the lower 2% rate.(5) As per note 4, there were different rates for construction and refurbishment projects and for different types of projects.(6) As per note 4, there were different rates for construction and refurbishment projects and for different types of projects.(7) Under the Enterprise Area scheme lessors could claim capital allowances on 100% of qualifying expenditure at a rate of 25% initial allowance and 4% annual allowance.(8) Double Rent Deduction was not available for buildings in Enterprise Areas located at an airport.(9) The Initial Allowance was increased to 50% in the case of expenditure incurred from 1 January 1998 on a qualifying building located in an Airport Enterprise Area.(10) For Multi Storey Car Parks the annual allowance of 4%, free depreciation of 100% and initial allowance of 50% applied to expenditure incurred after 31/7/1998 where no lease had been granted for the purposes of double rent relief.  For expenditure incurred prior to this date the capital allowances available were restricted to a maximum 50% write-off of the capital expenditure incurred.  Under these circumstances an annual allowance of 2%, free depreciation of 50% and an initial allowance of 25% applied.(11) For Multi Storey Car Parks the latest date for entering into a qualifying lease for the purposes of double rent deduction was 30/09/1999.(12) Capital allowances for expenditure incurred on hotel projects are of long standing and different rates have applied over time.  From 1956 to 27/1/1994 the annual allowance was 10%.  From 28/1/1994 to 31/7/2008 the rate was 15% for the first 6 years and 10% in year 7.  From 1/8/2008, subject to transitional arrangements, the annual allowance is 4%, giving a current write-off period of 25 years.(13) The accelerated allowances for Childcare Buildings are available in respect of expenditure incurred from 1 December 1999.(14) See Note 13.(15) This scheme has not yet been commenced.  When the Commencement Order is made, the commencement date will be made retrospective to 13/3/2008.(16) Expenditure incurred on registered holiday camps after 31/7/2008 is written off at a rate of 4% per annum.  For expenditure incurred prior to 27/1/1994 an annual allowance of 10% applied.SCHEMES (note 1)START DATETERMINATION DATEUrban Renewal 19941/8/199430/4/1999Customs House Dock25/1/198831/12/1999Temple Bar Area30/1/199131/12/1999Urban Renewal 19991/8/199831/07/2008Town Renewal1/4/200031/07/2008Rural Renewal1/6/1998 (note 2)31/07/2008Living Over the Shop6/4/200131/07/2008Park & Ride1/7/199931/07/2008Student Accommodation (note 3)1/4/199931/07/2008Designated Islands1/8/199631/12/1999Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme (note 4)6/4/200131/07/2008Notes to Table 2(1) There are two types of residential tax relief, ‘section 23' type relief and owner-occupier relief. ‘Section 23' type relief (rented residential relief) is given, in its entirety, as a deduction from rental income in the year the property is first let under a qualifying lease.  If there is insufficient income to absorb the relief it is carried forward as a rental loss until used up.  Therefore, there is no standard writing off period — it could vary from 1 year to indefinitely as it depends on the ability of the investor to absorb the relief.  In contrast, owner-occupier relief is granted at a fixed annual rate over 10 years, i.e. at 5% of the qualifying expenditure in respect of expenditure on construction or at 10% in respect of expenditure on refurbishment.(2) 1/6/1998 for ‘section 23' type relief and 6/4/1999 for owner/occupier relief.(3) ‘Section 23' type relief only.(4) Relief is available under the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme in respect of rented residential property that is located anywhere in the country.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available, are set out in the following tables for 2006, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.COST OF TAX CREDITS, ALLOWANCES AND RELIEFS 2006 AND 2005The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits. To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.The figures of cost are for 2006 and 2005 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. Some of the cost figures included in the table for 2005 reflect revisions to figures previously published in the 2007 Report.TABLE IT6: Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2005 and 2006(1) Estimated cost forTax Relief Provision20052006€mNumbers€mNumbersINCOME TAXExemption LimitsGeneral Exemption(2)

65.213574.7141NOTES ON TABLE IT 6(1) Figures accompanied by an asterisk * are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.(2) The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a “net pay” basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.(6) See the following table “Green Paper on Pensions” for background commentary and cost figures for 2007.(7) Arising from the work on the “Green Paper on Pensions” (2007) the basis for costing this item was changed for 2005 and is not directly comparable with the figures for earlier years. See also the following table “Green Paper on Pensions” for more recent figures.(8) “Other” relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties.(9) The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits, income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant), and also includes tax on (see Note 10) (a) donations made by the PAYE and self-employed sectors to approved bodies (b) income tax repayments on foot of PAYE donations. It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.(10) The cost figures for relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies and for certain Sports Persons are based on self assessment returns.(11) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2005 and 2006.(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with “unused capital allowances”, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company’s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3340 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2006 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2005 and 2006 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.(15) The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.(16) The costs shown for R&D is for claims for R&D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2005 and 2006. However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.
Green Paper on Pensions — updated estimates of cost for 2007
As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.The review drew on newly available 2007 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2007 are included in the table below.Estimated costsNumbers*€ millionEmployees’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes590708,100Employers’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes150385,100**Estimated cost of exemption of employers’ contributions from employee BIK540385,100Exemption of investment income and gains of approved Superannuation Funds900Not availableRetirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)420123,900Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)6556,400Estimated cost of tax relief on “tax-free” lump sum payments130Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee and employer contributions240Not availableGross cost of tax relief3,035Estimated tax yield from payment of pension benefits410Net cost of tax relief2,625*Numbers as included in P35 returns from employers to Revenue for 2007.

Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax — uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2006 tax returns
Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns. This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2006, is set out in the following table.The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.Tax Incentive/Income ExemptionAmount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax cost €mNumber of claimants€m€mUrban renewal351.7140.53,436Town Renewal93.038.71,149Seaside Resorts15.76.41,167Rural Renewal94.038.02,137Multi-storey car parks40.216.6119Living Over the shop7.12.782Enterprise Areas7.43.0129Park and Ride6.92.832Holiday Cottages22.99.5660Hotels277.1106.61,515Nursing Homes35.514.7538Housing for the Elderly/infirm3.41.495Hostels1.960.8223Guest Houses0.20.17Convalescent Homes4.11.718Qualifying Private Hospitals25.210.6284Qualifying sports injury clinics0.103Buildings Used for certain childcare purposes14.36.0304Student Accommodation162.564.31,059Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.40.16Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions90.722.5185Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands13.65.41,231Exempt Patents (section 234, TCA 1997)395.083.81,120Totals1,662.9576.215,299Notes:The figures shown  relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2006 form 11 and CT1.There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax  returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 42% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually  subject to tax.Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6. For example, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.

In summary, therefore,  the pension-related deduction applies to public servants who are employed by or hold an office or position in a public service body and are members (or entitled to be members) of a public service pension scheme.The length of an individual's contract is not relevant as to whether or not a deduction is to be made. In general, most contract staff in the public service are now eligible for pension scheme membership. In addition, a person who is on a contract and, for example, is entitled to a payment such as a gratuity in lieu of membership of a pension scheme, would be liable for the deduction.If the person to whom the deduction has applied leaves (a) without a benefit or preserved benefit, or (b) without a payment in lieu or preserved payment in lieu, and (c) without transferring the service, a refund of the pension-related deduction is provided for under Section 6 of the Act.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (the so-called McCarthy Report) was published in July 2009 and outlined 271 recommendations with potential savings of up to €5.3 billion in a full year along with associated staffing reductions of over 17,300 in public service numbers.  The Special Group’s Report is advisory in nature.  The Special Group’s analysis and recommendations have been taken into account in the 2010 Budget and the estimates of expenditure for the year ahead.  The Government decided to implement 32 recommendations in full and 89 in part.  These savings are estimated to yield some €1.7 billion in 2010 and €1.9 billion in a full year.  The Report of the Special Group and its recommendations will continue to inform Government considerations of overall expenditure strategy as well as ongoing structural reform in the public service.As regards my own Department, the Report recommended that general administration and programme efficiencies amounting to €5 million could be achieved, specifically in the areas of staff numbers, and subventions to the Institute of Public Administration and the Economic and Social Research Institute.  In relation to staff numbers, the Report recommended a reduction of some 10%, or 60 posts, by end 2010.  At the time of the Report, the authorised number of staff in my Department was approximately 650.  The number currently serving is 539.44 (whole-time equivalents).   This is already below the level recommended by the Group.  The issues of the subventions for the IPA and the ESRI will be considered in the context of my Department's estimate for 2011.As regards other recommendations in the Report which relate to the possible rationalisation of  certain state agencies, the Group considered that the routine investigation functions of the Ombudsman's office are performed at too high a staff grading level (typically at AP level) and that there is scope for this work to be undertaken at lower levels without prejudicing service. The Minister for Finance has asked the Ombudsman to explore this option further.The report also recommended that Ombudsman/Regulators' Offices should be rationalised within a single Ombudsman Commission. The bodies concerned are the Office of the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner, the Children's Ombudsman, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments.There appears to be a balance of administrative advantage in favour of the merger of the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments with the Office of the Ombudsman and in conjunction with the Offices concerned and we are identifying the administrative and legislative measures necessary to give effect to the merger.Any merger with the remaining Offices mentioned in the recommendation (none of which are under the aegis of the Department of Finance) would need to take account of the diversity of roles of all of the Offices concerned and the need for varying degrees of independence and specialisation in exercising their statutory functions. It is not clear at this stage if it would be feasible, or worthwhile to pursue this option in the short term. It is likely that detailed legislation would be required to give effect to these changes.

On this basis, the full year yield to the Exchequer of abolishing the rent relief for private accommodation scheme would be of the same order, although it should be noted that the value of the relief was increased in Budgets 2007 and 2008.

Under that Act the regulation of casual trading is the responsibility of the local authority in whose functional area the trading takes place.  Local authorities regulate casual trading under bye laws issued by them under the Act.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no special licences for the sale of alcohol at open markets e.g. farmers markets; indeed the sale of alcohol at such markets is not permitted.  It is a matter for An Garda Síochána to monitor such markets for the sale of alcohol generally and the issue of control of sale including the selling of alcohol to minors etc.If of course the Deputy is referring to a special event, e.g. a summer festival, the holder of a publicans licence may apply through the District Court to have their licence extended to cover a particular occasion.

In this regard, the Office of Public Works (OPW) maintained in their submissions to the arbitrator that no rent increase was justified while the landlord maintained his position that an increase was merited.  The Arbitrator's determination, which is legally binding on the concerned parties as provided for under the lease, provided for an annual increase of the order of 24% in the monies payable.  OPW's relationship with the landlord of any premises is governed solely by the terms and conditions of the lease and the matter raised is outside OPW's remit.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	777	The Valuation Act, 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health-care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.The Act maintains the long-held position that all commercial properties, including childcare facilities provided on a private fee-paying basis are liable for rates.  Such rateable premises would ordinarily include playschools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools.Where a premises is used exclusively, under the ECCE funded services scheme, to provide sessional places for 38 weeks of the year, the premises is exempt from rates.  If the premises is used outside of the 38 week period for other educational uses, where the services are:(a) available to the general public; and(b) are not for private profit; or(c) the expenses are defrayed wholly or mainly out of moneys provided from the Exchequer the premises will not be liable for rates.Where a premises which enjoys exemption from rates by virtue of its exclusive use under the ECCE funded services schemes, which relates to providers of sessional places for 38 weeks of the year, is used by the occupier for commercial purposes outside the 38 week period, the entire premises will be deemed liable for rates.Exemption can only be granted where the premises are used exclusively for educational purposes.  Therefore, where the occupier alternates the use of the premises between rateable and non-rateable purposes during the rating year, under valuation legislation, that premises is deemed to be rateable for the entire year.I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation act, 2001 and that as Minister for Finance, I have no function in decisions in this regard.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	779	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year gain from increasing the rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) from 25% to 28% is €48 million.  This estimate assumes no behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers.CGT is very dependent on individual behaviour and a change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution.  The realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.  In addition, increasing the rate could, in theory, lead to a reduction in yield from the tax.Tax is one factor in our competitiveness as an economy.  While the rate of tax is a consideration, the most important concern in making an investment is the ultimate return.  An increase in CGT might deter individuals from disposing of assets.  However, a rate of 28% would be relatively low in historic terms.The Deputy may be aware that the recent UK emergency budget increased the rate of CGT for UK higher rate income tax payers from 18% to 28%.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	780	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from doubling the rate of Capital Acquisitions Tax from 25% to 50%, based on the Budget estimate of €240 million for 2010, could nominally be in the region of €240 million.It should be noted that this estimate is based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of such an increase, which could lead to a less than expected result from a change to the tax rate — any behavioural impact could not apply to inheritance tax, but might apply to gift tax.  In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.Capital acquisitions tax is due on gifts and inheritances if either the disponor — the person making the gift or leaving the inheritance — or the donee — the person receiving the gift or inheritance — is either Irish resident or ordinarily resident, or the property being gifted/inherited is Irish situate property.  In this light any increase in CAT would not affect our "tax competitiveness".

In this context the review would consider how external information and advice, including critical and dissenting advices, were dealt with by the Department and how they should be dealt with in the future.The review will have due regard to the skills, training and staffing mix required by a modern Finance and Economic Ministry in order that it can best fulfil its role in relation to, for example:Economic risk assessment;Policy development, advice and implementation;Optimising the Department's performance in all of its areas of operation;Communication, transparency and accountability.I want to ensure for the future that the Department of Finance can give the best achievable policy advice, can better assess risks and opportunities in the fiscal, economic and financial system, and in relation to the public service, can manage its own operations with high levels of effectiveness and efficiency.  I know that the Department has good, skilled and capable staff, but I want to be sure they are used to best effect and that the mix of skills is optimised.When terms of reference are finalised they will be published.I would intend that the review will be carried out — expeditiously — by individuals who have informed expertise on the role and operation of Finance Ministries internationally.  The proposed review is of the Department of Finance and its functions but may, presumably, draw conclusions in relation to broader relationships and assignments within the Government system in that context.As far as the Department of the Taoiseach is concerned, if there are any issues relating to the role of that Department arising from the consideration of the reports into the banking inquiry, and from the review of the Department of Finance, the Taoiseach will, of course, be anxious to deal with them.  That Department is currently the subject of a review under the Organisational Review Programme and any issues arising from that Review will be addressed in that Department's follow-up Action Plan.

Consequently the sale of burial plots by a local authority on or after 1 July 2010 will be subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5%.  This arises out of the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland of 16 July 2009 in Case C-554/07 in respect of services provided by public bodies, including local authorities.In practice, the VAT liability on the sale of grave spaces will depend on when the cemetery was developed.  In this regard, the sale of grave spaces from a cemetery that was developed more than 5 years prior to 1 July 2010 will remain exempt from VAT.  It is understood that most local authority cemeteries were developed before 1 July 2005.  Where VAT is applied, the impact on families will depend on whether, and the degree to which, the VAT is passed on by the local authorities, which in any event should be limited somewhat since public bodies providing the service will have entitlement to deduct VAT incurred on their inputs.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I understand the Deputy is referring to cancer screening programmes.  There are two national population cancer screening programmes — BreastCheck and CervicalCheck — provided by the HSE's National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS).CervicalCheck offers free smear tests through primary care settings to women aged between 25 and 60 years.  Screening will be provided every three years to women aged 25 to 44 years and every five years for women aged 45 to 60 years.  The NCSS keeps under constant review the evidence base, involving any research conducted in Ireland or internationally, that would influence the target population for CervicalCheck.  International best practice currently recommends that population-based cervical screening programmes should target women aged from 25 or 30 years to 60 or 65 years.BreastCheck provides free screening to women aged 50 to 64.  It remains my intention to extend BreastCheck to women in the 65-69 age group as soon as resources and capacity allow.  In the meantime women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated specialist cancer centres.The NCSS has estimated that there are approximately 85,000 women in the age group 65-69 and that the additional cost of expanding the programme would be around €5 million per annum, with a capital investment of  approximately €3 million.  However BreastCheck's main priority in 2010 is to maximise uptake in the 50 — 64 year age cohort.The Deputy will also be aware that preparations are underway for the introduction of a national colorectal cancer screening programme in 2012 for men and women aged 60 to 69 years.  Over time this programme will be expanded to cover everyone in the 55 to 74 age group.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	816	The current legal position in Ireland in relation to cannabis and cannabis based medicinal products such as Sativex is that they are Schedule 1 controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act  1977. All Schedule 1 substances are substances which are considered as having no medicinal use and the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis and cannabis derivatives is unlawful except for the purposes of research.My Department is aware that claims have been made in respect of Sativex and its possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis and cancer.  As the law currently stands it would not be possible for Sativex to be licensed here for medicinal use or for a General Practitioner to prescribe it. As cannabis is the drug which is most abused in Ireland, I am reluctant to loosen the controls on its use. However, I am seeking expert clinical advice in this matter and I am open to making a change to the Misuse of Drugs legislation to allow for the use of medicinal cannabis based drugs such as Sativex, if the expert advice indicates that a change is warranted.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	828	I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year.Children will qualify for a free pre-school year place when they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.   This means that children born between  2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will qualify in September 2010.  From the information provided by the Deputy,  the child in question is not eligible for the scheme in September this year but will be eligible in September 2011.The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year will be expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the pre-school year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will participate in the scheme each year.In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  Notwithstanding this, the ECCE scheme provides for an eligibility range of almost 17 months.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age.As in the case of any scheme introduced, cases will arise where individuals would rather that certain conditions did not apply.  However, it is necessary that the scheme is delivered within a structure which supports the best delivery of pre-school education and it is considered therefore that the age range provided for is appropriate.Arrangements are already in place for the pre-school year which is due to commence in September 2010 and these do not provide for any amendment or reduction in the lower age for eligibility.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	830	When this issue came to the attention of the National Cancer Screening Service last month it investigated the matter and has now provided a full statement on its website at www.cancerscreening.ie about the difficulties in accessing a target population for which a database has to be developed from a number of different sources.The NCSS has assured me that the return of these unopened letters has had no adverse overall impact on uptake levels for the CervicalCheck Programme. During 2009 CervicalCheck aimed to screen 240,000 women, but in fact approximately 280,000 women were screened.   Uptake levels in 2010 continue to reach projected monthly targets.The reason for letters not reaching the intended person relates mainly to population mobility.  There are over 1.2 million women aged 25 to 60 eligible for a free smear test as part of the CervicalCheck programme. As there is no central population database in Ireland, CervicalCheck has assembled a register from information supplied by the Department of Social Protection and self registration of women.  The database used by CervicalCheck is known as the Cervical Screening Register (CSR).  The CSR is a confidential, secure electronic database containing demographic details and screening history details of women in the eligible population.  The Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 provides the legislative framework for the compilation of the CSR.CervicalCheck communicates with every woman whose details are provided and relies upon the accuracy of such information. If communications are not responded to, the NCSS sends a number of subsequent reminder letters to ensure that every effort is made to contact eligible women. CervicalCheck encourages any woman who changes her address to notify the programme of the change in her details.I understand that the information held on the CSR is used only by CervicalCheck and is not shared with any other agency.

It replaced the previous system of Nursing Home Subvention which had been in existence since 1993. Individuals who were already in receipt of subvention when the scheme commenced can remain on subvention or can opt to transfer to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.The scheme is administered by the HSE and individuals can apply for support via their local HSE Nursing Home Support Office.The National Treatment Purchase Fund's role under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is to negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with private nursing homes that wish to participate in the scheme. The HSE will supply individuals with a list of all homes participating in the scheme.As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	842	The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a system of financial support for individuals in public, voluntary and approved private nursing homes. The scheme is available to anyone assessed as needing long-term nursing home care. However, it does not cover long-term residential care in other settings, such as mental health and disability facilities.When Government was considering proposals for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, it decided to limit the scheme to long-term nursing home care, so as to set the rates for what was a new and innovative scheme within well defined criteria, where likely costs could be more reliably predicted. However, it also committed to reviewing the scheme three years from the date of its introduction and agreed that any such review would include explicit consideration of the extension of the scheme to the mental health and disability sectors.The facility referred to by the Deputy is not a registered nursing home. It is an Approved Centre registered under Section 64 of the Mental Health Act 2001.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The rates of organ donation vary widely between Member States of the European Union.  Ireland consistently performs above the average EU rate of organ donation.  In 2008, Ireland's annual rate was 18.4 organ donors per million of population, compared to the EU rate of 18.2.  In 2009, Ireland significantly increased its level of organ donation to 20 organ donors per million of population, which is expected to again place it close to or above the average EU rate.As part of a public consultation on consent for organ donation, the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland indicated that it favoured the current opt-in organ donation model with a preference for improvements to the organisation of the organ donation system. I intend to bring a draft General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill, which includes the issue of organ donation for transplantation, to Government for its approval.  Subject to this approval, I will publish the General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill.  Two separate but related public consultations took place in 2009 to inform the preparation of the draft legislation.  The first was a consultation process on consent for organ donation which took place between January and March 2009, in which the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland participated.  Invitations for written submissions were complemented by a consultative forum which took place in February in Dublin Castle.  The second public consultation was in relation to proposals for a General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill which took place between April and May 2009.  Information on these consultations is available on the Department's website.  Consultations with Government Departments and Offices are on-going and the draft General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill will be further developed based on the outcome of the consultations.Notwithstanding Ireland's relatively strong performance in terms of organ donation, options to further improve organ donation should be open to consideration.  With this in mind, I agreed with the Health Service Executive, as part of its 2010 Service Plan, that it will establish an organ donation and transplantation unit within its existing national structures and resources.  This unit will provide a national focal point for reporting, monitoring and assessing organ donation and transplantation activities.  It is appropriate that these functions be carried out at a national level, on the basis of regular, comprehensive performance data provided by all the transplant centres.  This approach will provide a sound basis for evaluating performance and examining other issues related to organ donation and transplantation, including proposals such as those raised by key stakeholders, including the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	845	I have consistently emphasised the need to improve facilities and services to persons with cystic fibrosis. Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multidisciplinary in its composition and included representation from the Department of Health and Children, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The report was published in October 2009.The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St.Vincent's Hospital. Additional funding of €1.6m has been provided to St. Vincent's to enable the recruitment of additional staff across the full range of disciplines for the specialist treatment of cystic fibrosis. A number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities. These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus Ward, and a new Accident and Emergency Department which includes single room accommodation. The refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis was completed in August 2008 and the beds are now operational. This brings the total level of in-patient accommodation for the treatment of respiratory patients (including people with CF) at the hospital to 63 beds.A new ward block to replace existing accommodation is being developed at the hospital. This facility will provide single room en-suite inpatient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with CF, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities. Tenders for this development are currently under consideration. It is estimated that the construction, equipping and commissioning of this block will take approximately 18 months.The hospital currently treats over 50% of the CF adult population.  The HSE is now working with St. Vincent's to identify opportunities for patients who do not require tertiary level care to be treated close to home where adult services have been developed in the other specialist centres. Capital funding has been provided for the development of outpatient facilities for patients with CF treated at Beaumont Hospital.  HSE funding enabled the construction of a three storey building consisting of two floors each of 14 single rooms, and 8 bed HDU and two additional ICU rooms (within existing ICU).  The project is in two phases and the first phase (decanting) was completed at the end of 2009 and the second phase is currently underway.Services for patients with cystic fibrosis are also provided at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, Tallaght Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, Mid Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, University College Hospital Galway and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Additional funding provided to all of these hospitals has enabled the recruitment of additional staff  for the specialist treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis.

The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has put in place a scheme which meets the provisions of the Directive — details were set out in the Guide to Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Registration Scheme, September 2007.Under the Medicinal Products (Control of Placing on the Market) Regulations, 2007, all medicinal products on the market must have either a marketing authorisation or a certificate of registration. As provided for in Directive 2004/24/EC, the Regulations provide an exemption from this requirement until 30 April 2011 for traditional herbal medicinal products that were on  the market in the State on the coming into force of the regulations (20 July 2007). The IMB has issued guidance to companies in relation to the ending of this transitional period in its most recent newsletter.

I understand that much of the existing HSE material in relation to deaths of children in care in the past ten years relates to case files and internal reviews of individual cases: it may not take the form of formal reports which could be considered for publication. However, the intention is that this material may be considered by the Independent Review Group established by me.The Deputy will be aware, in this context, that the Health Amendment Bill is being enacted urgently to facilitate consideration of sensitive information relating to child deaths by the Independent Review Group.

Acute bed numbers in public hospitals are counted as an average of beds available over each year.  The number of acute beds in private hospitals at any time is not collected or verified by my Department or by the HSE.  However, I understand that in 2009 there were approximately 2,300 inpatient beds and 450 day beds in private hospitals which are members of the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation.The national average number of acute hospital beds available in public hospitals in 2007, the latest year for which validated data has been compiled by the HSE, was 13,688. This includes both inpatient beds and day places.  An average of approximately 20% of these are categorised as private beds.My Department has requested the HSE to provide validated data on the national average number of acute hospital beds available in 2008 and 2009 to the Deputy as soon as these become available.It is not possible to indicate the average number of acute hospital beds which will be in operation in 2011.  However the emphasis must continue to be on the most effective use of acute bed capacity for patient best care, through shortened lengths of stay, day of surgery admission and more day case activity.

I expect to see significant progress on the implementation of this initiative, including the identification of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	903	The Implementation Plan for the recommendations of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was accepted by Government and published in July 2009. One of the key recommendations of the Implementation Plan is that an additional 270 additional social workers be recruited by the HSE between 2009 and 2011 in order that the HSE can fulfil its care planning and other statutory obligations to children in care.  This is made possible as the approved Employment Control Framework for the HSE exempts social worker posts from the current moratorium on recruitment and the filling of vacancies.  An amount of some €14m has been provided to the HSE in the current year to progress the implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan Commission.One of the principal commitments in the Ryan Implementation Plan is the need to ensure that all children in care have an allocated social worker and a care plan. To this end, the Government has committed to filling 270 HSE social worker posts by the end of 2011 and to the frontloading of this initiative in 2010 with the filling of 200 posts.This initiative is designed to target resources at front line services in order to ensure that the HSE fulfils its statutory obligations. The Oireachtas has voted that the necessary finance be provided and the filling of these posts has been exempted from the public service moratorium on recruitment and replacement of staff. There is an explicit commitment in the HSE Service Plan for 2010, as laid before the Oireachtas, that these posts will be filled.I met with senior HSE representatives, including the Chairman of the Board, in recent weeks to review the progress being made in this regard. The HSE is in the process of interviewing approximately 400 candidates, in order to form a new panel of suitable candidates to fill all 200 posts in the current year. I am advised that 60 offers of employment issued from the HSE on foot of interviews which commenced in June, and that further offers are to be made this week. The 200 extra social workers will undertake a range of statutory child care functions, as per the recommendations of the Ryan Report.  The recruitment of these additional social workers is critical in terms of progressing the Implementation Plan and in ensuring the allocation of a named social worker to each child in care and the to the availability of care plans for all of these children. I have been assured by the HSE that the matter is being afforded the highest priority both by the Board and by senior management.The matter of the allocation of resources across particular HSE regions is a service matter for the HSE. In this regard I have requested that the HSE respond directly to the Deputy.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	914	I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January this year.The objective of the ECCE scheme is to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.  Targeting the pre-school year at a particular age cohort is fundamental to the scheme and requires the setting of minimum and maximum age limits within which children are eligible to participate.  In setting these limits, account was taken of a number of factors including the differing enrolment policies of primary schools and the fact that the great majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years and 6 months and 5 years and 6 months.Children will qualify for the scheme where they are aged more than 3 years and 2 months and less than 4 years and 7 months at 1 September each year.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age, or where a child cannot start primary school until a later date due to the enrolment policy of the local primary schools.  In September 2010, children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will be eligible for a free pre-school year place.  It is accepted that if parents choose to send their children to primary school from within two months of reaching their fourth birthday, they will not be able to benefit from the scheme.It is necessary to the objectives of the ECCE scheme that appropriate age-related early learning activities are provided to children in their pre-school year.   As in the case of any scheme introduced, cases will arise where individuals would rather that certain conditions did not apply.  However, the scheme must remain sufficiently targeted to ensure the best delivery of pre-school education and, therefore,  it is not proposed to extend the eligibility age range beyond that currently provided for.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	917	The entitlement of an individual to services under the Health (Amendment) Act, l996 now rests with the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In respect of persons who have made an application after 20th June 2006, the legal position is clear and unambiguous.  The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the definition of eligibility inserted in the Health (Amendment) Act 2006 by section 6 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received after the specified date.In respect of persons who made an application before that date, the Chief Executive Officer is still obliged to satisfy himself that the applicant was infected with Hepatitis C.  In that regard, I have asked the HSE to take account of any relevant decision of the Hepatitis C & HIV Compensation Tribunal on the basis that the Tribunal arrives at its decisions after careful consideration of expert testimony.I have given a great deal of consideration to the issue of women who have neither a positive test result nor a positive Tribunal decision in their favour and I am very sympathetic to the women in question.  However, I have to take into account the rationale which led to the clarification of eligibility requirements in 2006 and accordingly, I do not envisage a change in the current eligibility requirements.I should point out that the women in question are entitled to apply for a regular medical card.  Application forms for a medical card are available from the HSE's local health offices.  The HSE has discretion to award a medical card to a person whose income is over the financial guidelines, where the HSE decides that the financial burden of medical or other exceptional circumstances would cause undue hardship.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	935	Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe involving other organs.  Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop the disease. A number of cases are diagnosed each year, but the true figure is unknown. However, research has determined that there are about 30 human cases per year in Ireland. In 2007, 71 specimens were confirmed positive for Lyme borreliosis, suggesting a crude incidence rate of 1.67 per 100,000 that year.  A recent study in the west of Ireland at Galway University Hospital suggests that the disease incidence may be higher in the Galway area.Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland. This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local Director of Public Health, so this makes estimates of incidence difficult.  However, the schedule of infectious diseases is reviewed on a periodic basis and inclusion of Lyme disease will be considered in the future.A fact sheet on Lyme disease, developed by the Vectorborne Subcommittee of the Scientific Subcommittee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), is available on their website (www.hpsc.ie) to provide members of the general public and media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme disease and provides information on the prevention and treatment of the disease. This is currently being updated with a view to bringing increased awareness of the disease to the attention of those most at risk e.g. having the information available through the websites of Coillte, the Irish Farmers Association and Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and also Local Authorities. In addition, last Autumn an awareness raising article was placed in Epi-Insight, the HPSC disease surveillance report which is targeted at clinicians with a view to increasing awareness of the disease.

The Report was published by the Mental Health Commission the following day.The Report made a number of recommendations in respect of both facilities referred to by the Deputy.  In relation to Kerry General Hospital the inspector found that the Acute Mental Health Admission Unit was a well-run unit.  He also acknowledged that while the number of beds had  reduced since the previous year, which resulted in more space for the residents, the unit continued to transfer residents to St Finan's  Hospital.  The inspector recommended that the practice of transferring patients to St Finan's should cease and that plans for the 4-bed high observation unit at Kerry General Hospital be progressed as a matter of urgency.In relation to St Finan's the Inspector concluded that three of the five wards were not suitable for habitation or for the provision of care or treatment.  The Inspector recommended that the hospital should close.  The service has a closure plan which includes the building of a 25-bed continuing care and challenging behaviour unit for older persons with mental disorders, a 15-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit and a 10-bed community residence for the remaining residents.The closure of old Victorian hospitals is in line with Government policy in mental health  contained in ’A Vision for Change’ which was published in January 2006.

One of the Green Routes to be developed under the CASP is the Carrigaline/Ringaskiddy route.  The Green Route Programme in Cork is managed by Cork City Council in both the City Council and County Council areas, and all funding for Green Routes whether in the City or County areas is provided to Cork City Council.In 2009 I allocated funding of €200,000 towards preliminary works on the county section of this route which includes the road mentioned by the Deputy.  In 2010 I have allocated €5.33 million to Cork out of a total allocation of €14 million for bus priority and park & ride in the regional cities.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	950	I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.Because of the difficulties with the public finances, I decided in July 2008 that insofar as development projects are concerned, expenditure under the regional airports Capital Expenditure Grant Scheme should be focused on project elements at the regional airports where the airports have already entered into contractual commitments.  The provision in my Department's Vote to fund the capital expenditure grant scheme for all the Regional Airports in 2010 is €3 million.  In April this year, based on the funds currently available within my Department's budget, I allocated grants for urgently required work to Donegal and Knock Airports and for the completion of projects  which were contractually committed.  Later this year, I intend to give further consideration to the overall capital funding in future years of projects at the Regional Airports, including the proposed runway end safety area project at Kerry Airport.  This will be done in the context of a Value for Money review of regional airports which was recently submitted to me and which I am now considering.Ireland's aviation policy as set out my Department's current Statement of Strategy is to promote regular, safe, cost effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets.  Through a number of financial support mechanisms my Department seeks to facilitate, where practicable, the continued safe and viable operations at the airports, while also encouraging maximum commercial autonomy and initiatives by the airports concerned.  It is a matter for each individual airport, including Kerry Airport, to optimise their services and promote them as they see fit.

The size and shape of the Public Safety Zones is based on international aircraft accident statistics coupled with the estimates of the maximum number of aircraft operations on each of the runways at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports.In the ERM Report, the consultants state that in the event of any extensions to runway lengths the Public Safety Zones would be recalculated and that they were unaware of plans that were sufficiently detailed to warrant Public Safety Zone  modelling at the time of writing the report.

Following consideration by a Visa Officer it was refused on the 13 May 2010 for the following reasons:1. The evidence of finances submitted was deemed insufficient in that a six month bank statement immediately prior to the application was not submitted.2. It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the applicant did not have sufficient obligations to return to the country of origin following the proposed visit.The applicant appealed the refusal to grant a visa.  The decision of the Visa Officer was upheld by an Appeals Officer on the 1 June 2010.  While the Visa Appeals Officer was satisfied as regards evidence of finances, the obligations of the applicant to return to the country of origin was not sufficiently addressed.  In particular the Visa Appeals Officer had concerns surrounding the authenticity of the applicant's payslips.  Each visa application is entitled to one appeal only.  It is however open to the applicant to submit a fresh visa application at any time.

Following on from this, certain items were transferred to other prisons.   The Irish Prison Service engaged the services of CCM Property Services, Midleton, Co Cork to dispose of equipment at public auction.  As it was not cost effective to have the kitchen dismantled and brought to auction for sale, a purchaser was identified through CCM Property Services.  Kitchen equipment and fittings were sold to Foodequip Technology Ltd who dismantled part of the kitchen and bore the cost of transporting the equipment off the Island.  This kitchen equipment realised €14,000.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  However, I understand that the persons concerned are refugees. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of both applications is ongoing and the files will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

Adult asylum seekers are entitled to free access to Adult Literacy and English as a Second Language (ESOL) courses as well as mother culture supports.  These are provided by VECs either on-site at some of the larger centres or at locations in the local community.All children aged between 6 and 16 years, whether the children of asylum seekers or otherwise, are required by law to attend school and complete 3 years in second level school, whichever is the later.  Asylum seeker children resident in RIA accommodation generally have a high attendance rate at school, although there are, of course, a few cases where children in this age-bracket have not attended school for short periods due to medical or other reasons.All schools are required to make a return to the NEWB (National Education Welfare Board) of any child who has missed 21 or more days from school.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The NEWB has a key role in supporting parents where there are problems with school placement or attendance difficulties for their children in school.  In addition, the NEWB has, in the past, issued information leaflets to parents and run public awareness campaigns to raise the profile of school attendance.  The NEWB also operates an Education Helpline to provide information on attendance and related matters.Finally, I should add that, to my knowledge, there are no children of asylum seekers resident in RIA accommodation centres at present not attending school.

His mother subsequently made an application for asylum which was refused. The mother of the person concerned was subsequently granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a parent of an Irish citizen child, born before 1 January 2005, in accordance with the revised arrangements announced on 15 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.  The person concerned was not included in his mother's permission to remain in the State at that time as he was an adult by then.In early 2008 the person concerned sought permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a family dependant of the parent of an Irish born child who had been granted permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Scheme. By letter dated 18 March 2009 the person concerned was informed that he had failed to demonstrate current residency as a family dependant in the State and consequently his application to remain in the State on that basis was refused.  Subsequently, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 15 February 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.The person concerned had his case examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on their behalf by their legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 3 June 2010, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Orders is an operational matter for the GNIB.

This permission to remain was granted in July of 2005, was renewed in July of 2007 and is currently valid until 19 July, 2010.To obtain an Irish passport, the children of the persons concerned must be Irish citizens. Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 provides that, subject to section 6A, every person born in the island of Ireland is entitled to be an Irish citizen. Section 6A of the Act as inserted by section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 provides that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  The section does not apply to certain persons including those born to parents one of whom is at the time of the person's birth an Irish citizen, British citizen or a person entitled to reside without restriction on their period of residence. For the purpose of calculating reckonable residence under section 6A certain residence is excluded from consideration including unlawful residence, residence covered by a permission granted under Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 for the purpose of study and temporary residence covered by a provisional permission granted pending determination of an asylum application.In determining if a child, who has applied for a passport to the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs on the basis that they have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, is entitled to a passport, the Passport Office makes an assessment of the parent's reckonable residency through an examination of their permission stamps. If the parents do not have sufficient residency and the child does not have an entitlement to citizenship, then it will be open to the parent of the child to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation on their behalf under section 15 of the 1956 Act, when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.

These relate to the programmes in a range of subheads which include Gender Mainstreaming, Graffiti Removal Operations, Equality Monitoring Consultative Committees, European Refugee Fund and RefugeeIntegration. The McCarthy Report  recommended a total reduction of some €5 million in respect of these particular items. The actual budgetary reduction was €6.92 million.A significant proportion of the recommendations (€84 million) related to reductions in payroll costs on items such as allowances payable to members of the Garda Síochána and the Prisons Service.  In common with all Departments, there are significant reductions in payroll related provisions in 2010 to take account of the reductions in payroll rates and other factors. The overall reduction in gross payroll budgets for the Justice Sector compared with the 2009 estimate is in the region of €126 million.A number of recommendations were made by the McCarthy Group on structural reform and rationalisation across the Justice and Equality Sector. Decisions in respect of many of these recommendations will be a matter for decision by Government in due course and expenditure reductions that may arise will be included in the budget for the Sector in future years. The Deputy will be aware of the recent transfer of functions in relation to the Equality, Disability, Integration and Human Rights areas from my Department to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.While it was never the intention that the full €134 million reduction recommended in the McCarthy report would be delivered in 2010, significant progress in this regard has been made. This is through a combination of the recommendations in the report and other measures being taken as part of the Government's budgetary policy.

Local Garda management is aware of one incident of anti-social behaviour having occurred in the area in 2010.  I am further informed that the incident referred to by the Deputy had not been reported to An Garda Síochána.  A member of the local Community Policing Unit contacted the resident at the location, and the incident is now subject to investigation.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, Including the Community Policing Unit, supplemented by the District Garda Mountain Bike Unit, Detective and Drugs Units, the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  A member of the local Community Policing Unit is allocated specifically to the area referred to and regularly attends meetings with local residents.  Local Garda management closely monitors patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of communities, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This approach will promote an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

As part of the Road Safety Strategy 2007 — 2012 and in accordance with the strategic goals of the Garda Síochána Policing Plan, a targeted approach to speed enforcement is being undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries on our roads and improve road safety.I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, has completed an extensive analysis of the collision history of the road network.  Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred where speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.  Based on this analysis, a list of speed enforcement zones has been drawn up.  An Garda Síochána is utilising these zones to direct speed enforcement activity in a proportionate and targeted manner.  The zones are subject to on-going review.  Work on implementing the safety camera project which will provide an additional 6,000 hours speed enforcement time a month to augment Garda resources is underway.The years 2008 and 2009 were the lowest years on record in Ireland for road fatalities, and this downward trend is continuing to date in 2010.  In 2008, there were 279 fatalities recorded, a reduction of 17% on the previous year.  In 2009, there were 242 fatalities recorded, a reduction of 13% on 2008.  Up to 29 June this year, 22 less people have been killed on our roads, compared with the same period last year.

The correspondence in question did not raise the claim that Government officials were buying guns.  I was informed by the Garda authorities that the person in question made a number of allegations of unlawful activity and inaction by the Garda Síochána.  The Garda have found no evidence to substantiate the claims made.  Local Garda have met with the complainant to discuss the allegations and he has declined to make a formal statement of complaint to the Garda.  In circumstances where the complainant will not make a formal statement to the Garda it is difficult for them to further investigate the various matters raised.

They include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.While the law generally operates successfully in this area I am aware that difficulties have arisen in some cases because of the effect of a judgment of the High Court last year. The High Court judgment in that particular case had implications for sections 6 (imprisonment in the case of non-payment of debt) and 8 (imprisonment relating to non-payment of maintenance) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940. The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes in the law consequent on that judgment in accordance with legal advice.I am currently in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to developing early proposals for amendments in respect of maintenance enforcement which I hope to include in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.

If the High Court is satisfied that such assets are the proceeds of crime then they may be frozen for a period of a least seven years.The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 introduced provisions whereby all relevant parties can consent to the application of Section 4A Order to allow for a disposal order to be made by the High Court before the seven year period has elapsed.While the Bureau regularly targets certain properties under both the Proceeds of Crime and Taxation legislation, there are statutory limitations on the disclosure of such information in the course of investigations and any subsequent Court proceedings.It is therefore the policy of the Bureau not to disclose information on specific properties until investigations are completed and the Courts have made a final determination.I am advised by the Bureau that they have conducted a number of investigations in County Kerry during the past years and they continue to work in close liaison with Criminal Asset Divisional Profilers in Kerry to target assets suspected to derive from criminal conduct.

The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 makes it an offence to solicit or importune another person on a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  The offence can be committed by the prostitute, client or third party. The Act also provides for offences such as organising prostitution, coercing or compelling a person to be a prostitute, knowingly living on the earnings of a prostitute or keeping or managing a brothel.Section 23 of the Criminal Law (Public Order) Act 1994 created offences in relation to the publishing or distribution of every form of advertisement for prostitution in the State.  The legislation covers advertisements in terms, circumstances or manner which gave rise to the reasonable inference that a premises is a brothel or an advertised service is one of prostitution.  Furthermore, "advertisement" is defined as including every form of advertising or promotion, including by way of radio, television, computer monitor or other like means of communication.  The maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is a fine not exceeding €12,700.I am, of course, deeply aware of the issues of the trafficking of persons and persons who may be coerced into working as prostitutes.  When I launched the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking in June 2009, I emphasised the Government's commitment to protect vulnerable people who may become victims of traffickers and to tackle the crime of human trafficking.  The Government has taken robust legislative, administrative and operational measures to combat and prevent trafficking in persons for both sexual and labour exploitation purposes.  These measures include the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which has greatly strengthened the law in this area.  Under section 5 of the Act, it is an offence to solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, public or private for the purposes of prostitution.  Furthermore a person who accepts or agrees to accept a payment, right, interest or other benefit from a person for the purpose of the prostitution of a trafficked person is also guilty of an offence.  The offence carries a penalty, on summary conviction, of a fine not exceeding €5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both and, on conviction on indictment, a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in February, 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  This has led to the production of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, the implementation of which is monitored by a special Interdepartmental High Level Group.  In addition, An Garda Síochána has established a Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit.The detail of individual investigations is, of course, a matter for An Garda Síochána.  I am confident that the Garda are vigorously enforcing the law in this area.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have conducted a number of operations to combat brothel keeping, prostitution and human trafficking and will continue to do so in line with the intelligence available to them.  There have been some notable successes in identifying and prosecuting those who have organised and benefitted from prostitution.  One example of such operations is a recent investigation by the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, in conjunction with a number of other police forces, which resulted in the apprehension, in another jurisdiction, of individuals for brothel keeping in this country.  The operation led to the seizure of a substantial volume of evidence.  In addition, cash and other property discovered during this operation will be the subject of a proceeds of crime application to the courts.The law on prostitution is kept under continuing review in my Department.  Suggestions are made from time to time for amendments to the legislation but, before bringing forward suggested changes in this area, I would have to be satisfied that they would be in the interests of the vulnerable people concerned and would not leave them open to greater exploitation.The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office within my Department and has responsibility for promoting internet safety.  It also has a role in considering measures to address illegal and harmful content on the internet.

Local Garda management is not aware of an incident of the type referred to by the Deputy having occurred at the location.  I am further informed that a member of the local Community Policing Unit attempted to contact the person referred to concerning such an incident.  However, no response was received.  Any incidents reported to An Garda Síochána will be fully investigated.One Sergeant and six gardaí are attached to the Community Policing Unit in Clontarf Sub-District.  These community Gardaí liaise with the local community and business groups in the Sub-District, including in the area referred to.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, Including the Community Policing Unit, the Garda Mountain Bike Unit and the local Detective and Drugs Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Current policing strategies are designed to prevent crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour, and community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy.  This will ensure an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1014	The Government continues to attach a high priority to supporting Irish communities abroad. In recent years, funding for the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP), which is overseen by my Department, has substantially increased; from €4.1M in 2004 to over €15M in 2009. The primary focus of the Programme is on the provision of welfare and support services to vulnerable or marginalised Irish people abroad. This includes outreach to the elderly, and information and advisory services which enable Irish emigrants to access local statutory entitlements.The welfare of the Irish community in Britain has long been a key priority of the Emigrant Support Programme, with over €51M allocated to projects based there since 2004. In 2009 alone, ESP funding was allocated to some 140 organisations in Britain.The table illustrates the yearly breakdown of funding for organisations in Britain since 2004:YearAllocationEquivalent to£€20044,333,4201

Since 2005 ESP grants are approved and paid out in local currency, in an effort to minimise the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.Due to the increased budgetary pressure currently being felt across Departments, the budget allocation for the Programme in 2010 has seen a decrease of 14%, to just under €13M. While this decrease is regrettable, it must be recognised that this allocation still remains significant and in excess of the levels of funding before 2007. We will continue to prioritise frontline welfare organisations which provide services to the most vulnerable and marginalised members of the Irish community abroad.Applications from the British based organisations for funding under this year's Emigrant Support Programme budget are currently being reviewed by officials in my Department. I hope to be in a position to make a further statement about the amounts to be allocated to organisations in Britain in the coming weeks.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1015	I utterly condemn the murder of over 90 members of the Ahmadiyya community in Lahore, as well as the terrible injuries visited upon so many others as they worshipped in two mosques in the city on 28 May.  Nothing can justify attacks which cause such senseless carnage and destruction.   On my own behalf, and on behalf of the Government, I once again extend my deepest sympathies to the bereaved families on their great loss.These heinous attacks bring to public attention once again the threats which exist to the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan, the discrimination they can face there and in neighbouring countries, and issues relating to other minority communities more broadly.There are reports that two persons suspected of having taken part in the attacks were arrested in Lahore on 2 June and remain in custody.As I mentioned in my response to previous questions in this House in relation to the Ahmadiyya community, most recently 9 June, promoting religious tolerance remains a key objective of Ireland and the EU in relation to Pakistan.  Bilaterally, and through the EU, we have urged the Government there to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions.  In our bilateral contact with Pakistan, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining adequate protections for minorities in Pakistan.  Minority and human rights issues in Pakistan were discussed at political consultations held between Ireland and Pakistan at Political Director level in Islamabad on 10 February last.  The issue of the recent attacks has been raised with the Embassy of Pakistan and my Department will continue to discuss issues relating to minorities in its ongoing bilateral contacts with Pakistan.At EU level, the EU Council Conclusions on 28 April and 8 December 2008 reaffirmed the importance of human rights in Pakistan as a central priority for the EU.  Human rights and minority issues were discussed with Pakistan, most recently at the second EU-Pakistan Summit held in Brussels on 4 June.The Government of Pakistan has made it clear that it is committed to the protection of minorities, the promotion of religious tolerance and combating the terrorist actions of the local Taliban and other radicals.  However, it faces very serious challenges in this regard.  Many hundreds of innocent Pakistani civilians from many parts of the country, from many tribal and religious groups and from all levels in society have fallen victim to terrorists.  In the case of the attacks on the Ahmadiyya community on 28 May, I note that the Punjab wing of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has claimed responsibility and that the police are reported to have also arrested seven men with alleged links to this group.The EU has pledged to assist the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to fight terrorism. In this context, leaders at the EU-Pakistan Summit on the 4 June agreed to further strengthen cooperation between the EU and Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, both within the framework of the United Nations as well as in other relevant forums.  The EU and Pakistan also reiterated that counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and should be implemented in full respect of international law.

These properties are used primarily as Chanceries and official Residences of Heads of Mission. All costs in relation thereto are the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The total amount paid in respect of relevant costs was €2,389,728 in 2009. However, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that this figure also includes costs for some 109 properties abroad which are rented; it is not possible to readily isolate costs in relation to properties owned by the State.

The types of evidence considered are immigration stamps in passports and Garda National Immigration Bureau cards and registration books.A passport application was submitted for a child of the person named on 13 August, 2009 to the Passport Office in Balbriggan (PPOB).  The evidence submitted showed that the child's mother did not have the required amount of reckonable residence in the four years prior to his children's birth.  Accordingly, the passport application could not be approved.On 19 August 2009 the Passport Service wrote to the mother seeking additional information which might confirm the level of necessary reckonable residence.  If this new evidence of can be submitted the passport application can be re-examined.

Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004, persons born in the State after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside without restriction in the State or in Northern Ireland, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for 3 years of the 4 years preceding their birth.In the case of applications for passports arising from the terms of the 2004 Act, it is the practice of the Passport Office to seek evidence of lawful residence in the State by one or both parents.  The types of evidence considered are immigration stamps in passports and Garda National Immigration Bureau cards and registration books.Passports applications were submitted for both children on 26 January, 2009 to the Passport Office in Balbriggan (PPOB).  The evidence submitted showed that the child's father did not have the required amount of reckonable residence in the four years prior to his children's birth.  Accordingly, these passport applications could not be approved.The PPOB wrote to the applicants' parents on 4 February, 2009 to advise them of its decision and the reasons behind it.  They were requested to furnish further evidence of the claimed period of three years reckonable residence in respect of the father.  A reply to this letter was received by the PPOB on 24 September, 2009.  Unfortunately, this response failed to demonstrate the children's entitlement to Irish citizenship.  These passport applications could not, therefore, be finalised.The PPOB wrote to the applicants' parents again on 25 September, 2009 to advise them of its decision and the need to submit additional evidence of the father's reckonable residence. This letter also suggested that any evidence of reckonable residence in respect of the applicants' mother could also be submitted.  No reply to this letter has been received to date by the Department from the parents.These applications are still open to the parents to pursue.  If the required evidence of reckonable residence is submitted, these applications can be finalised for passport issue.  Otherwise, the applications will have to be cancelled and a refund of the paid passport fees will be made.

These were considered in the context of this year's budget and public service estimates and it was decided to implement a number of them in full or in part.Recommendation in the report of the Special GroupCommentOverseas Missions savingsAn 8% cut in the Administrative Budget allocation to the Department and the moratorium on staff recruitment has impacted on the Department’s network abroad.Some refocusing of resources is being implemented in the current year, including a trial of a new, lighter model of overseas representation.The grading of Heads of Mission has been addressed with a reduction in the number of Assistant Secretaries foreseen during 2010. Given the important contribution that is being made by our diplomatic network in promoting our key objectives abroad, in particular, support for our economic recovery, I have not taken the step of reducing our number of Missions.Reduce Staff Numbers by 65The staffing complement of the Department is now 65 below the authorised numbers for the DepartmentCease funding the European Movement in Ireland and the Ireland United Nations AssociationThis has been implemented for the Ireland UN Association.Reduce allocation for Contributions to International Organisations by €5 millionThe 2010 allocation has been reduced in line with the recommendation of the Special Group, although it is at this stage evident that it will not be possible to cover mandatory contributions due in 2010 from the amount allocated.Cease expenditure to EU and other European States under Subhead KThis has been fully implemented in line with the recommendation of the Special GroupMaintain allocation for Vote 29 at 0.39% GNP in 2010 and extend timeframe for reaching UN target until 2015Vote 29 ODA for the current year was set at 0.42% of GNP in order to ensure that Ireland exceeds its EU commitment as a Member State to spend 0.51% on overall ODA in 2010.Given changes in the reference GNP levels, savings in excess of those recommended by the Special Group report were achieved.The alignment with the EU timeframe of 2015 to meet the UN target has also been agreed.Reduce expenditure on Support for Irish Emigrant Services
This was implemented in 2010 with a reduction of €2.2mThe report of the Special Group, which foresees a multi-annual implementation period, continues to inform decisions being taken by me in terms of the allocation of resources within my Department.The Report forms an important part of the backdrop in making decisions on resource allocation within the Department and also forms an important component of the Government's financial consolidation programme.The overall effect of this programme has been beneficial in restoring Ireland's competitiveness and in protecting our reputation in international financial markets.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	Angola has undergone major development since the end of its civil war, one of the longest-running civil wars in Africa, in 2002.  It has achieved rapid economic growth, thanks to a boom in oil production and high international oil prices.  As Africa's largest oil producer, Angola's economic boom continues today, notwithstanding a temporary downturn in 2008/09.Hopes that the ending of Angola's civil war would lead to more political openness have only partially been fulfilled.  Angola's first parliamentary election since 1992, and only the second since 1975, took place in September 2008.  While an EU election observation mission welcomed the peaceful conduct of the elections it did not, however, go as far as describing them as free and fair.  UNITA challenged electoral results in the capital Luanda, and four other parties challenged the distribution of seats, but the Constitutional Court rejected complaints due to lack of evidence.  Following this ruling, all parties accepted the result of the election.  In January this year the ruling MPLA party used its two thirds majority in parliament to push through a new constitution which reinforces the position of President José Eduardo dos Santos, who has ruled Angola for over thirty years, including by abolishing the provision for the election of the President by popular vote and allowing him to serve for two further five year terms.Many aspects of human rights in Angola are of concern, in particular women's rights and gender based violence, the rights of the child and the situation in relation to human rights defenders.  In February this year, when Angola underwent a Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council, Ireland asked several questions and made recommendations on these subjects.  The EU, along with some EU member states and other countries, also intervened, asked questions and made recommendations on a variety of subjects, including reform of the criminal code, arbitrary detentions, trafficking in persons, and insufficient protection for internally displaced persons.  Whilst Angola did not accept all of the recommendations made during the process, it acknowledged that some improvement in the human rights situation in the country is required.  Ireland, along with our EU partners and the international community, will continue to monitor the situation with regard to human rights in Angola and will avail of appropriate opportunities to press the Angolan Government to fulfil its human rights obligations.Ireland-Angola relations are limited, and there have been few opportunities for political dialogue in recent years. However, conscious that the country's rapid economic growth masks huge inequalities, Irish Aid does provide some funding to the Angolan people, amounting to over €4 million since 2008. This funding is channelled through Irish and international non-governmental and missionary organisations to support their work in combating HIV & AIDS, reducing food insecurity and promoting good governance as well as on various humanitarian assistance projects.On a broader level, the promotion of democratic accountability and equality in order to ensure equitable and sustainable development is a policy priority of the Irish overseas aid programme.  Our work in this area includes participation in election monitoring and support; support for parliaments and parliamentary reform; support for strengthened public financial management systems and oversight bodies; and support for civil society, including independent media.  Irish Aid will continue to prioritise support to this important area and help to ensure effective, equitable and accountable governance in developing countries, particularly in Africa.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1022	According to the latest figures available from the Central Statistics Office, there were 1,541,200 overseas visitors to Ireland in the first four months of 2010, representing a fall of over 20% on the same period in 2009.  While the decrease in visitors to Ireland is disappointing, it must be understood in the context of a decline in tourist numbers internationally.  Tourism worldwide has been deeply affected by global economic difficulties and loss of consumer confidence.  Furthermore, the exceptional weather conditions in the first two months of this year affected not only Ireland but also most of our overseas markets, while airports were closed again in April and May due to the volcanic ash cloud.  Given these difficult conditions, it is now clear that the growth targets for 2010, set late last year, will be very difficult to meet.However, it is important to note that over 60% of holidaymakers normally arrive into Ireland between May and September.  A number of euro zone economies are coming out of recession and these are important source markets for Irish tourism.  As regards domestic tourism, survey results have shown a significant increase in the number of Irish families that intend to holiday at home this year.  I know that the industry and the tourism agencies are fighting hard for every bit of the available business for the summer and remainder of the year.To assist the tourism sector, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, training and business supports are being rolled out by the tourism state agencies under the tourism services budget of the Department which was increased to over €153 million in 2010 and included maintaining the real level of investment in overseas marketing, as well as a very significantly increased capital allocation for tourism product.In terms of the broader policy environment, the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group published last October set out a clear plan for the survival, recovery and growth of Irish tourism, which the Government has been progressing.  In line with the Renewal Group's Framework for Action, my Department and the tourism agencies are working extremely hard to assist the sector, to maximise business for Irish tourism and to ensure that the tourism agenda is in all relevant policies.Tourism Ireland is focusing on those overseas major markets that are likely to deliver immediate returns this year including Great Britain, Germany and the US, as research has shown these markets as our best prospects.  On 6th May, I launched a €20m Summer Marketing Campaign on behalf of Tourism Ireland which was designed to win as much business as possible in our key target markets during the peak and shoulder season.  The new marketing drive was developed in conjunction with hundreds of tourism industry partners who are supporting the campaign with a range of value-for-money offers.This week as part of an intensive promotion of Ireland's tourism, cultural and sport attractions in the United States I met with key industry figures, conducted media interviews and launched the 1901 Census on line to the US audience.   On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland launched a €4 million promotional campaign to encourage holidaying at home this year and is investing in business, sporting and cultural events.  Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are boosting promotion of business tourism in the build up to the official opening, in September, of the Convention Centre Dublin.Fáilte Ireland is also working closely with businesses all over Ireland to increase their customer base, better manage costs, improve overall performance and sustain employment.  In 2010, Fáilte Ireland is investing over €11 million in direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.Overall, I believe that Government is pursuing the right programmes and measures to support the continued development of tourism.  We are working with the industry and the tourism agencies in order to position the tourism sector for recovery and growth as part of the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1024	The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, as published in July 2009, made a number of recommendations in respect of my Department and the agencies under its aegis.  Specifically, the Special Group made proposals to reduce programme expenditure by almost €105 million in 2010 and to structurally reduce 170 staff across the Department and its agencies.  It also proposed that consideration should be given to the discontinuation of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism as a Department in its own right. This department's three sectors make a major contribution to Irish society and the economy. This must be considered alongside the recommendations in the Special Group's report.The Government considered the Special Group's report prior to Budget 2010 and adopted the report's recommendations in a number of areas where the benefits of the changes proposed were considered to outweigh any disadvantages.Savings of more than €35 million, or almost 7 per cent, were achieved in the Revised Estimates for 2010 for the department's Vote Group, compared to 2009.  Moreover, the Government's moratorium on staff recruitment and promotion and its incentivised early retirement scheme continue to achieve reductions in staff numbers across my Department and its agencies.In May 2010, the Government made structural re-alignments to a range of Departments of State.  As part of these re-alignments, the former Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism became the current Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, having an enhanced emphasis on maximising the benefits to Ireland, in financial and other terms, of both our tourism product and our cultural and sporting heritage.  In addition, responsibility for the horseracing and greyhound industries was transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.I am confident that this Department has a strong role to play in Ireland's economic recovery and am determined to work with the various agencies and stakeholders to maximise the economic potential of the tourism sector in particular.

The organisation in question was awarded grants under the 2006 and 2007 Sports Capital Programme of €175,000 and €70,000 respectively.  The organisation also received a RAPID top-up in 2006 of €52,500.  The grant allocation was subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which includes the execution of a deed of covenant and charge.A deed of covenant and charge provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.The Department's legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor's Office — CSSO — deals with the grantee's solicitor in ensuring that these issues are satisfactorily resolved before grants can be paid.  The current position is that the Chief State Solicitor's Office is awaiting documents to be submitted by the landlord's (Cork City Council) solicitor.

It was explained to them that there were no funds available at the present time as there is no existing Sport Capital Programme open for applications. However, no decision has been made on the timing of the next round of the Programme.  Is will be open to any organisation, with a suitable application under the terms and conditions pertaining at that time, to apply for funding under any future rounds of the Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1028	Questions on budgetary or taxation policy are matters for my colleague, Mr Brian Lenihan, TD, Minister for Finance, in the first instance.  The Government must consider any measure with tax or spending implications within the wider context of fiscal sustainability and economic renewal and the Air Travel Tax is regarded by the Minister for Finance as an important revenue raising measure.Of course, I acknowledge the concern among many in the tourism industry that the imposition of the Air Travel Tax could potentially affect the competitiveness and viability of routes to and from Ireland, with possible implications for levels of access.  Since my appointment as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, such concerns have been raised with me both informally and formally, during meetings with tourism representative bodies and with airlines such as Aer Lingus, Aer Arann and Ryanair.However, the range of factors which affect the numbers of passengers (including inbound tourists) and the viability of access routes are varied and cannot be attributed to a single tax.  From the tourists' point of view, the additional €10 or €2 must be seen in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, accommodation and other holiday expenditure.As Minister with responsibility for tourism, I will be conveying the views of the airlines and other stakeholders to the government in the context of the deliberations on Budget 2011, so that the issue can be considered from all angles.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	As the Deputy will be aware, all State property issues, including the acquisition, lease and rental of buildings and accommodation on behalf of Government Departments, are a matter for the Office of Public Works and I must advise the Deputy that my Department does not own any of the properties it currently occupies.  For the sake of completeness however, I have provided below the details of the annual costs for building and land maintenance, including light and heat expenditure requested by the Deputy in respect of my Department's accommodation, which the Office of Public Works leases on behalf of my Department:The total annual cost of building and land maintenance is €126,830.The total annual cost for the provision of heat is €27,007 andThe total annual cost for the provision of light is €134,815.In relation to the Deputy's request for similar information in relation to bodies/agencies that are funded from my Department's Group of Votes, the Deputy will appreciate that, given that property maintenance and development is a core activity of a number of these bodies, the time and resources required to provide the very detailed and extensive information requested would not, in my view, be commensurate with the benefits arising. If the Deputy, however, has a query in relation to a specific agency or body that is funded from my Department's Group of Votes, I will be glad to have any such specific query responded to.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	As the Deputy is aware, the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes represented a set of options to reduce expenditure and staff numbers across the public sector. These options were considered by the Government within the context of framing the 2010 Budget.Gross savings of some €57 million, or almost 12%, were achieved in the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for the then Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Vote relative to the 2009 REV.  While the allocations in most expenditure programmes were reduced, the primary concern was to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department were protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities. With regard to the reduction in staff numbers, the Government's moratorium on staff recruitment and promotion and other associated measures, including the incentivised early retirement scheme, have achieved, and continue to achieve, reductions in staff numbers across my Department and relevant agencies.Finally, as part of the restructuring of Departments and agencies announced in March by the Taoiseach to ensure greater coherence and produce more efficient delivery, my Department incorporated responsibility for social inclusion policy and family policy from the Department of Social Protection and for equality, disability, integration and human rights from the Department of Justice and Law Reform. As stated by the Taoiseach in this context, it is important, while addressing the priority issues in responding to unemployment and driving economic recovery, that we do not lose sight of the importance of social development, the targeting of the most vulnerable and support for those working to make a difference right across our communities.

Between 2000 and 2009, overall expenditure on Child Benefit grew from just €638 million to approximately €2.5 billion per year. However, with tax revenues having fallen dramatically, we cannot afford to maintain spending at this level.The Government is conscious that the payment can be an important source of income for all families and so decided against withdrawing Child Benefit completely from any family and that it was fairer to reduce the Child Benefit rates across the board, while fully protecting up to 420,000 children in families who are dependent on social welfare or in low income employment.Families with children who are dependent on social welfare have been fully compensated for the reduction by getting from January 2010 an extra €3.80 per child per week in the value of the Qualified Child Increase paid with the principal payment.  Families, who currently receive a half-rate Qualified Child Increase, because they have other household income and so are not totally dependent on welfare, have received from January 2010 an extra €1.90 per child per week.The Family Income Supplement income thresholds have also been increased since January 2010 in order to compensate low-income working families for the cuts in Child Benefit.  FIS is paid for 52 weeks if the recipient continues working for at least 19 hours a week or 38 hours a fortnight. The new thresholds are being used to calculate the value of FIS claims since January. For existing claims, in line with standard practice on FIS, the level of payment for existing FIS claimants will remain at their pre-budget level but may change in line with the family circumstances at that time if the payment is renewed during the year.

Current data on the total number of private rented sector tenancies is not readily available from any one source; however, it is clear that the rent supplement scheme play a large role in the private rented sector.The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established in September 2004, under the aegis of the Department of Environment, Housing and Local Government (DoEHLG) to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The PRTB annual report states that at 31st December 2008 there were 206,000 tenancies registered representing some 354,000 tenants, it also stated that it was very pleased with the high level of compliance by landlords.The most recent information available from the Central Statistics Office's published in 2007 indicates that there were 141,000 private rented dwelling units in 2006. On the basis of the information available it is fair to say that rent supplement supported tenancies represent approximately half of the private rental market.

Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax from the year in which the claim was made.  The scheme provides that the Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of artistic works in the following categories only:1. a book or other writing;2. a play;3. a musical composition;4. a painting or other like picture, and5. a sculpture.In relation to social insurance, legislation provides that workers are insured as either employees or self-employed contributions.  Employees are those who are in employment under a contract of service.  It is also provided that those who were not under a contract of service but have reckonable emoluments or reckonable income, as defined, are insurable as self-employed contributors.The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Artists are generally adjudged to be self-employed workers, liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3%. They are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.75%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments by satisfying certain conditions including a means test.  There are no plans to alter the arrangements outlined above.

At the end of May, 2010, the live register stood at 437,922.  This represents an increase of 5,265 on the April figure of 432,657 and is influenced by seasonal factors that cause the live register to rise over the summer months. The cost of funding unemployment support programmes is €4.3 billion ,€2.8 billion of which has been provided for the Jobseeker's Allowance  scheme and €1.5 billion provided for the Jobseeker's Benefit scheme this year.While unemployment has an adverse impact on departmental budgets and on the public finances generally, I am acutely conscious of its  human consequences and the need for those affected to get access to financial supports as quickly as possible.  One of the main priorities of my department is to ensure that customers get paid on time.  In this context, effective measures have been taken to keep delays to a minimum. These include the introduction of improved processes and procedures to increase productivity and the assignment of additional staff to claim processing. Apart from providing people with timely access to financial support after they lose their jobs, it is important that as many people as possible are kept in work and that support is available to help people move from welfare back into employment.  While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Innovation, my department has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP), operated jointly with FÁS, is the main activation measure for jobseeker's.  Under the NEAP, everyone who is approaching 3 months on the live register is identified by the Department of Social Protection  and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to assisting them enter or re-enter the labour market.  22,765 people were referred to FÁS under the NEAP in the period from January to March 2010, an increase of 36 % over the same period in 2009.My Department also provides jobseeker's with one-to-one assistance through its facilitator service.  Facilitators work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level and help jobseeker's develop individual progression plans to enhance their skills and ultimately improve their employment chances.  Almost 11,400 people were referred to facilitators in the five months to the end of May 2010.My Department will also, under the new role it has been given, including responsibility for the employment services of FÁS and various schemes such as the Community Employment Scheme, be much more directly involved in providing new opportunities to those who do not get full-time employment.My Department operates a range of activation programmes and second chance education opportunities which assist unemployed people and other social welfare recipients to improve their employability and personal and family situations.  The back to work enterprise allowance is designed to encourage the long term unemployed to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years.  At the end of May 2010, there were 7,114 people availing of the scheme.The short term enterprise allowance is payable to a person who qualifies for jobseeker's benefit and who wishes to commence in self employment.  This allowance is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker's Benefit entitlement.  At end of May 2010 there were 1,552 participants in the scheme.The back to education allowance (BTEA) aims to give welfare recipients who left school early and those without third level qualifications a second chance to attain educational qualifications so as to reduce their risk of long term unemployment.  The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme. 20,983 people were in receipt of BTEA at the end of April 2010.  Payment of BTEA to participants from jobseeker schemes ceases at the end of the academic year.In addition, my Department, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills and FÁS supports the unemployed under a number of new measures.  These include the Work Placement programme, the Short Time Work Training programme, the Back to College Initiative and the redundant apprentice programme.The Government is providing, through FÁS, a total of 147,000 training and activation places for jobseeker's.  In addition there were 166,000 places available, including additional provision, on education programmes in 2009, while the number of third level places has also increased substantially over the past ten years.The nature and structure of the supports provided by my Department to the people on the live register will continue to be monitored in the context of changes in the economic climate.  In that regard, the Governments top priorities are to foster the conditions that will support the maintenance and creation of employment and to provide appropriate financial and other supports to people who are unemployed in the meantime.

Any such staff must be very experienced and be in a position to operate without significant training. Therefore it has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources.

One of the conditions for receipt of the payment is that the recipient does not engage in any form of employment.However, an exemption to this requirement is provided for in very specific circumstances. Such an exemption, which typically lasts for 12 months, will normally take the form of employment which is deemed by the Department to be both part-time (i.e. not more than 19.5 hours per week) and rehabilitative in nature or, alternatively, a community employment scheme or a training course arranged by FÁS. An application for such an exemption must be made to the Department in advance of the employment or training course beginning.Disability Allowance is a weekly payment made to persons with a disability whose employment capacity is substantially restricted by reason of their disability and whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.   As well as providing income support for people with disabilities, incentives towards employment and training are also a key feature of Disability Allowance.  An income disregard for earnings from rehabilitative employment provides that all income up to €120 per week is disregarded as means when assessing entitlement, while income between €120 and €350 is assessed on the basis of 50 cents for every euro earned.The person referred to by the Deputy should contact his/her local Social Welfare office who will be in a position to advise him/her of his/her welfare entitlements and who will also be in a position to refer him/her to the local Jobs Facilitator who can advise more widely on potential options for  retraining.   The Deputy will be aware that FÁS, which has a statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of training to people with disabilities, also offers a range of training and related supports to people with disabilities and the person concerned should also make contact with their local FÁS office in order to explore the training options which may be available from them.

Jobseeker claims for people living in the Lucan area are administered by the Social Welfare Local Office in Clondalkin.  Signing-on for the majority of jobseeker's occurs once in any 4-week period.  However, to avoid the necessity for people in Lucan to travel to Clondalkin, they may sign-on at a signing centre in Lucan village.The signing centre in Lucan was open 2 days per month.  However, with the increasing numbers claiming Jobseeker's payments, this has been increased to 4 days per month.  The Department is keeping this arrangement under review.  The Department is giving priority to the provision of a local office in Lucan and efforts are ongoing to secure suitable accommodation there as soon as possible.

The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department.The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term support to enable people to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.Each application for mortgage interest supplement is determined by a community welfare officer taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case.  In addition, the HSE may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the HSE.People who are experiencing difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments or other household bills should immediately contact their lender or the relevant utility company to discuss arrangements to address their issues.  They should also contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which provides assistance for people with financial difficulties.  The service operates from 65 locations throughout the country and can be contacted either through a national telephone helpline or a website.

While the person's income from the previous 12 months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.For example, if a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the assessment of future income.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons, particularly those in the construction industry, and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels is reflected in any assessment of their means.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances.  In addition, it is open to the individual if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Any changes to these current arrangements could only be considered in a Budgetary context and in the light of available resources.

A person who makes a claim for jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, one parent family payment, disability allowance, State pension non-contributory, carer's allowance, widow's non-contributory pension, guardian's non-contributory payment, blind pension, domiciliary care allowance or supplementary welfare allowance must be habitually resident in the State.  A claim for one of these payments cannot be awarded until the person has shown that he or she satisfies this condition.Contributory benefits are not subject to habitual residence.  Also, certain entitlements under EU legislation (for example, child benefit for a person who is currently employed under Irish social insurance legislation, or supplementary welfare allowance for a migrant worker who has been employed since arrival here) may be determined without reference to the person's habitual residence.My Department is making every effort to streamline the investigation, decision, and (where relevant) appeal decision processes but, given the volume of new claims currently being received, some delay is unavoidable.

They must live alone or only with certain "excepted persons".If under 66 they may qualify for HHB if they are receiving invalidity pension, blind pension, incapacity supplement or workmen's compensation with disablement pension (for at least 12 months), disability allowance or an equivalent social security pension/benefit from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement and live alone or only with certain "excepted persons".The free travel scheme is available to people aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.

Payment is made not to the customers themselves but to contractors (dentists and opticians) on their behalf, who provide treatment at a reduced rate.  Consequently, by the time the Department receives an actual claim, the customer has almost always already received his or her treatment and it is the contractor who is waiting to be paid in the agreed monthly payment.The Treatment Benefit scheme currently has around 7,300 claims waiting to be processed, and a further 265 claims awaiting information from employers, the customers, and other EU countries.  This is a normal amount, representing less than one weeks intake of claims.In terms of new claims to be dealt with, the Treatment Benefit Scheme is meeting its processing targets.  Over 90% of qualified claims received in June, for instance, will be paid to the contractors in July. The remaining cases will be processed as soon as the Department receives the additional information requested.

Most of the agreements came into effect between 1989 and 1999.  The Agreement with the Republic of Korea came into effect on 1 January 2009.  Ireland also has a bilateral understanding with Quebec since 1 October 1994. In the cases of Austria and Switzerland the agreements have limited application, as the EU Regulations now apply to these countries.An agreement with Japan was signed on 29 October 2009 and it is envisaged that the remaining formalities will be completed to enable it to come into effect from the beginning of 2011.  The agreements with UK and Australia are the only agreements which have been revised.  The current Agreement with the UK, which came into effect on 1 October 2007, provided for the repeal of previous agreements which had been superseded by EU Regulations. Provision was made to extend social security protection for migrant workers moving between Ireland and the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which are outside the EU. The agreement with Australia was revised mainly to accommodate changes in Australian legislation. The process also facilitated technical updates on the Irish side (changes of scheme names etc.), but no substantive change was required.Revisions to the agreement with New Zealand are currently being negotiated. The New Zealand authorities are examining the impact on Bilateral agreements of changes to their national legislation.  The changes being considered on the Irish side are similar to the technical updating made in the revision of the agreement with Australia.  These agreements are working well and meeting their intended purposes. Revision of the substantive provisions on the Irish side are not considered necessary at present.

The month (or year) in which payments are issued and applications refused does not always correspond with the month (or year) in which the related applications are received. Thus, for any given period, the number of applications received does not equate with the number of payments issued and applications refused.

This represents 9% of the total jobseeker claim load nationwide.  As has previously been said in the House, when we look back over several years when the live register was at its lowest, there was always around 9% or 10% of claims awaiting a decision.Over the past year or more, the Department has made significant efforts to reduce the number of claims awaiting a decision to current levels.  In July 2009, there were over 82,500 claims pending a decision.  The current performance should be seen in the context that, in 2009 alone, local offices received over 670,000 jobseeker claims and so far this year, they have received over 200,000 claims.I appreciate the importance of getting claims decided as quickly as possible and I want to assure the House that staff in local offices and in the Department's inspectorate are doing all they can to ensure that claims are processed as quickly as possible.  The Department will strive to reduce processing times and the number of claims awaiting a decision even further where it can, either through streamlining processes and procedures or through the introduction of new technology to assist with claims processing.There are currently 806 jobseeker's benefit and 6,298 jobseeker's allowance appeals pending.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

This represents 6% of the total number of disability claims in payment.  The assessment of disability allowance claims is relatively complex as it involves both a medical assessment and means assessment to be completed before a claim can be decided.The Department continually monitors available resources against workloads with a view to maximising claim processing efficiencies. Additional deciding officers have recently been assigned on a temporary basis to deal with the processing of new claims. Processes and procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing.There are currently 3,423 Disability Allowance appeals outstanding.

The Central Bank has agreed to pay such costs while discussions with the other organisations are ongoing.Extend the timeframe of the naval vessel replacement.The recommendation will be taken into account in consideration of the replacement of naval vessels.*The reduction in Ireland's participation in KFOR was designed to deliver savings in line with the recommendations of the Special Group and as an alternative to a withdrawal from the UN operation in Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT).  Unfortunately, for other reasons, it became necessary to withdraw from the Chad mission in May 2010.

In order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes at a significant discount from market value contain a clawback provision. However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.A breach of contract conditions would be a matter for a local authority to pursue as it considers appropriate given the particular circumstances involved. The administration of the various affordable housing schemes is a matter entirely for local authorities and I have no plans to alter current arrangements.

Accordingly, a scheme was introduced in 2003, with the pool for performance awards set at 10% of the pay bill for the group concerned and with individual participants eligible to receive payments of up to 20% of pay.Details concerning awards made in 2006 and 2007 under the Performance Awards Scheme for the local government sector are contained in the annual reports of the local government Committee for Performance Awards (CPA) which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Awards are defined in terms of their distribution as a percentage of pay, the range of monetary values, and the number of recipients.Awards of 15% to 20% have only been made in the most exceptional situations where performance has surpassed all reasonable expectations and has resulted in the achievement of a major goal of the local authority.  Awards of more than 10% and up to 15% have only been made where performance has substantially exceeded the targets defined. Awards of more than 5% and up to 10% have been made where stretched targets have been fully met or exceeded (but not to a major degree).  Awards of 0% to 5% have been made where stretched targets have not been fully met.Each local authority manager who participated in the Performance Award Scheme submitted a statement of objectives to the CPA for approval. Awards were determined by the CPA, based on achievement in the relevant year for the approved objectives.  In accordance with advice provided by the Information Commissioner, in relation to the corresponding Civil Service Scheme, information naming officials and individual amounts paid to them is deemed a personal record and consequently is not made publicly available.No performance awards have been made in respect of 2008 or 2009. The scheme for the local government sector is currently suspended.

Once this information has been collected and collated it will be included in the quarterly statistics published by my Department.A total of 66 repossessions across all local authorities have been carried out in the five year period 2005-2009.  This includes 7 voluntary repossessions.  The tabular statement below provides a breakdown of repossessions by each local authority.Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) and more recently section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provide that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as the authority considers equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower. Local authorities can and do exercise the powers available to them under the Act and, in all arrears cases, they to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home.  Repossession, where it does occur, is always a last resort.To support consistency of approach and ensure best practice across all local authority areas, my Department recently circulated guidance, based on the Regulator's Code of Conduct, to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.Loans in respect of which interest rates in excess of 10% apply were issued by local authorities prior to 1991 and reflect the long-term costs of the funds to the Housing Finance Agency (the Agency) prevailing at the time these loans were advanced. Rates were fixed for the life of the loan (generally 25-30 years).Borrowers with these long term fixed rate local authority mortgages, which are no longer available, are permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector.  This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties (of up to six months interest or more) applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages. Early redemption without penalty means that the Agency — which operates on a self-financing basis — has had to bear the losses on such loans.In 2001, the position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in consultation with the Department of Finance.  This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce such interest rates would not be appropriate, particularly given the cost already being borne by the State where the holders of such loans availed of the option to refinance in the private sector without penalty.Assistance may, however, be provided to households experiencing difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments under the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.Council NameRepossessionsVoluntary RepossessionsCarlow County Council1Cavan County Council2Clare County Council2Cork County Council3Donegal County Council0Fingal County Council0South Dublin County Council21Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council0Galway County Council11Kerry County Council0Kildare County Council0Kilkenny County Council4Laois County Council9Leitrim County Council0Limerick County Council02Longford County Council22Louth County Council1Mayo County Council0Meath County Council2Monaghan County Council4Offaly County Council3Roscommon County Council0Sligo County Council0North Tipperary County Council01South Tipperary County Council3Waterford County Council0Westmeath County Council0Wexford County Council2Wicklow County Council0Dublin City Council7Cork City Council3Galway City Council0Limerick City Council0Waterford City Council6Clonmel Borough Council0Sligo Borough Council2Drogheda Borough Council0Wexford Borough Council0Bray Town Council0Athlone Town Council0Total597

In 2009 I wrote to all local authorities to advise that "Where a purchaser suffers a reduction in income during the year the appropriate subsidy calculated on the reduced income may be applied, pro rata, from a current date and the mortgage payment reduced accordingly”.In addition, where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) and more recently section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provide that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as they consider equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower. Local authorities can and do exercise the powers available to them under the Act and, in all arrears cases, try to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home.To support consistency of approach and ensure best practice across all local authority areas, my Department recently circulated guidance, based on the Regulator's Code of Conduct, to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.

The draft Guidelines are available on the Department's website at www.environ.ie.Section 2.5 of the draft guidelines outlines exceptional circumstances in both the development plan and development management context where limited flexibility in relation to access to national roads may be applied by a planning authority. It should be noted, however, that national secondary roads may provide a strategic function along all or part of their routes, and so any consideration of traffic and safety implications in respect of single rural houses should have regard to this.  Planning authorities need to ensure that substantial public investment in national transport infrastructure is not eroded by a lack of overall plan-led development.In assessing planning applications, planning authorities must continue to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.

This provision applies to all permissions.The Bill is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, having passed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 22 June and is expected to be enacted during the current Oireachtas session.

These provisions have been determined in the context of the overall provision for public services; they reflect the need to reduce public spending and, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement on 9 December 2009, have been guided by the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.My Department, local authorities and related agencies are working to maximise outputs from the 2010 provisions through prioritisation, increased efficiency and lower procurement costs generally.Recommendations in the Report relating to my Department are reflected, inter alia, in savings in administrative costs arising from reductions in public service numbers and pay; the reduced Exchequer contribution to the Local Government Fund (€226 million in 2010, in the context of wider developments relating to local government finance); the review of the EPA which is underway; the ongoing rationalisation of agencies in the housing area; and policy developments concerning charging for treated water use and more extensive use of leasing to ensure overall housing output is maintained at the highest level possible.The work of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group is now well-advanced: consistent with the approach in the Report, the Group is looking at the cost base and expenditure of, and numbers employed in, local authorities.The Report will continue to be taken into account in the development of policy and the management of programmes by my Department.

The standing Government position is that Ministers are responsible for the environmental implications of their own policy areas and programmes.In accordance with Directive 2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the management of waste from the extractive industries (the Mining Waste Directive), Member States are obliged to ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities, including abandoned waste facilities, located in their territory which cause serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential to become in the medium or short term a serious threat to human health, is drawn up and periodically updated.  This inventory has been compiled in a project involving the EPA, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and was published on 25 March 2010 by that Department, ahead of the 2012 deadline set out in the Directive.I understand that the Study assessed over 100 sites, and that three sites, including the Tynagh mine, are classified as class 1 from a contaminant point of view, requiring a full environmental risk assessment to be carried out, if not already undertaken. My Department will be meeting with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources shortly in order to map out a strategy for such facilities generally.

To date, the Task Force has met five times, with its most recent meeting taking place in June 2010.  Between meetings, my Department maintains ongoing contact with members of the Task Force, in order to progress work on the cessation arrangements for the project.In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  There are no ongoing rental costs in respect of the use of this property.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose. It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.Pending completion of arrangements for the disposal of the machines, costs are being incurred for their storage.  Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) for 2009 were some €182,500.

This approach is enabling the Government to deal proactively with the new circumstances in the residential property market, and balance economic and social needs in this context.I and my Department have met with representatives of NAMA to discuss means of securing a social dividend through the long-term leasing of suitable residential units for social housing purposes, while providing a return in line with NAMA's mandate.  With NAMA now operational, this engagement is continuing and will intensify in the period ahead.

The purpose of this review was to consider whether the Act best supported the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.I announced the preliminary outcomes of the review in November 2009; they include recommendations in a number of key areas, and have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays. Among the main issues that will be addressed by amending legislation are—a statutory objective of 6 months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications,the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members,the introduction of fixed fines where deposits are illegally retained by landlords,measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy,the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board,the inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel its current remit.A number of issues requiring further research, including how best to achieve the inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of those segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel its current remit, are being considered in detail. My Department will continue to engage in direct consultation with key stakeholders in this regard.The Government recently approved the preparation of Heads of a Bill to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and it is envisaged that the General Scheme of a Bill setting out the detailed proposals arising out of the review will be submitted for Government approval in Autumn 2010.I have no function in the operational matters of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), as it is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.

At end 2009, approved housing bodies had provided some 9,335 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around €1.3 billion had been drawn down from the HFA. Loan charges are waived provided the accommodation is managed and operated by the approved housing body in accordance with the terms of the CLSS.Following detailed consideration of all the social housing supply options available under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, the extension of terms of the Social Housing Leasing Initiative to include the approved housing bodies and taking account of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and in the report on the Strategic Review of the Capital Funding Schemes for Voluntary and Co-operative Housing carried out by independent consultants Grant Thornton in September 2009, a decision was taken to wind down the CLSS scheme by end 2011. A copy of the Grant Thornton report can be accessed through the Irish Council for Social Housing website at www.icsh.ie.Capital funding of up to 100% of the approved cost will continue to be provided to the approved housing bodies under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme for the provision of accommodation for groups with specific categories of housing need such as older people, people with a physical, intellectual or a mental health disability, homeless persons etc.

This definition was formulated to demarcate the boundary between the public and private spheres on the basis that it is ultimately a matter for the courts to determine whether a particular body is an organ of State for the purposes of the Act and, thus, subject to the Convention.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	I recently published the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure to be undertaken in County Mayo.   The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the Programme in County Mayo is some €71 million.  The Lough Mask Regional Water Supply Scheme — Water Treatment Plant Upgrade is included in the Programme amongst the list of contracts in the county to start in the period 2010 to 2012.With the changed economic climate and the finalisation of the first cycle of River Basin Management Plans, the new Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues. It also fully supports economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government's policy document Building Ireland's Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal .  The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed better to reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.In developing the Programme, a review was undertaken of all contracts and schemes listed in the previous Programme on which there had been little progress over the past 2 years, to ensure that those proceeding were aligned with current priorities.  In this context, while the upgrade of the Lough Mask Water Treatment Plant is considered to reflect Programme priorities, Mayo County Council's proposals for extensions to the Lough Mask Regional Water Supply Scheme had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.   The Council now proposes to upgrade the water treatment plants at Westport and Louisburgh under the Rural Water Programme.Mayo County Council's revised Procurement Strategy and Fee Proposal for the Upgrade of the Water Treatment Plant, received in March 2010, are being examined in my Department and a decision on those documents will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.

#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1126	I propose to take Questions Nos. 515 and 516 together.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is generally precluded under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual matter with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.  Under the Planning Acts, the Minister may only intervene in the planning process in respect of heritage matters.Under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2009, planning authorities are obliged to forward copies of development applications to the Minister where it appears to a planning authority that the proposed development could have an impact on either the built or natural heritage.In the context of the Minister's role as statutory consultee within the planning process, where a development application has been referred to him, the Minister may recommend to the planning authority that further information should be requested from the applicant or that certain planning conditions should be included in a grant of permission.  In exceptional cases, where significant negative impacts on nature conservation may not be mitigated or significant architectural and/or archaeological damage cannot be avoided, the Minister may recommend to the planning authority that planning permission should not be granted.  However, final decisions on development applications are matters for the relevant planning authority or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of planning appeals.Under section 33 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, a planning authority is required to give notice of its decision in respect of development applications to prescribed bodies and to persons who made submissions in respect of such applications.  Having reviewed the decision of a planning authority, the Minister may take the view that the observations made by him in relation to a particular application have not been adequately addressed by the conditions attached to the grant of planning permission and an appeal in respect of the application may be lodged with An Bord Pleanála.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1127	Continued high levels of funding in recent years for the Water Services Investment Programme and Rural Water Programme demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to the sector. Investment in the period 2000-2009 has seen an increase in water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.1 million and an increase in storage capacity equivalent to 1.6 million over the same period.The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, published in April 2010, was drawn up to deal with a number of environmental and economic priorities, including the need for increased water treatment capacity. The Programme also places a greater emphasis on water conservation, providing for network rehabilitation contracts with a total value of some €321 million to commence in the period 2010-2012. Reducing unaccounted for water is an important element in maximising the output from our water treatment plants and funding has been targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.Management of water supplies infrastructure, including the need to consider measures to address potential water shortages, is a matter for the water services authorities. It is open to authorities to consider a number of measures, including rationing and arranging for tankered water to communities where there are water supply difficulties. Authorities can also initiate media campaigns in their localities to heighten awareness of the need to use water wisely. Under the Water Services Act 2007, it is open to an Authority to make an Order, where a serious shortage of water has arisen or is imminent, to prohibit or restrict the use of water supplies for a period of time.  Such an Order could provide for a restriction on activities such as watering gardens, recreational parks or sports grounds, the washing of cars, the filling or replenishing a swimming pool, etc.Water Services Authorities are also required to have in place Drinking Water Incident Response Plans. While primarily focused on water contamination incidents, the general principles set out in these plans, including the need for ongoing liaison with other authorities regarding the sharing of alternative sources of drinking water, can also be applied to water shortage management.The National Federation of Group Water Schemes called on all group schemes and their members earlier this month to take steps to conserve water.  This would include restrictions on the flow of water at off-peak periods and avoidance of unnecessary water use, such as the use of hoses in gardens.  Where there are pressures on public supplies, local authorities would be expected to manage the situation in the same manner. My Department will be writing to local authorities shortly reminding them of the need to manage supplies carefully in prolonged dry spells and to take whatever steps are required, including engaging with local media, to highlight practical conservation measures and to remind people to use water wisely.

While the Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €92 million in the county during the period of the Programme, it was not possible to include all requested schemes amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion.The Kilcummin Sewerage Scheme is included in the 2010-2012 Programme as a scheme at planning.  In view of the high unit cost of providing the scheme, Kerry County Council has been asked to review the scope of the scheme before the Council can be given approval to prepare new Tender Documents.The Killarney Main Drainage Scheme, of which Aghadoe, Tralee Road and Lissivigeen are elements, is not among the priority contracts and schemes included in the Programme.The new Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government's policy document Building Ireland's Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Kerry County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.

The regulations take account of the Agency's national and international obligations in managing the fishery including the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive.  The regulations provide for a practical and equitable response to declining salmon stocks in the Foyle system.I understand that the regulations provide, inter alia, for the suspension of angling or the use of nets to take Atlantic salmon or sea trout in the Foyle Area if the number of migrating salmon counted going upstream in the Rivers Mourne, Faughan, Roe and Finn are below specified stock level targets cognisant of flood or drought conditions.I am advised that the Loughs Agency's decision to invoke these regulations and suspend commercial salmon fishing and limit recreational angling was due to the failure of the rivers in question to meet conservation limits.  The decision was based on assessment by the agency's scientific advisers (the Marine Institute and Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland) and fisheries managers, of data gathered from fish counters operating on the river system and in recognition of the international trend of continuing low marine survival of Atlantic Salmon.This information, including conservation limits and spawning targets, is published by the Loughs Agency in their annual River Catchment Status Reports and can be accessed on the Agency's website, www.loughs-agency.org.  The trend of decreasing survival at sea has been reported by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), most recently in the report of the ICES Advisory Committee 2010.The regulations introduced by the Agency provide for a reopening of the fishery if stock levels improve to a point where there is a harvestable surplus.

The most recent report, for the period to end March 2010, shows that there are over 1.5m broadband subscribers in Ireland.  Over 82% of those subscriptions (1.239m) are residential and ComReg estimate that 77% of Irish homes now have a broadband connection.The breakdown by platform, and year-on-year increase to the end of March 2010, are set out in the table hereunder (Table 1).  The full report is available on ComReg's website at www.comreg.ie/publications.The overall broadband policy framework is set out in ‘Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland', which I launched in June 2009.  The policy paper set out the basic policy framework that investment in broadband, including Next Generation Networks (NGN), is primarily a matter for the market facilitated by an appropriate regulatory regime.  The substantial increase in broadband availability, take up and quality over recent years confirms the effectiveness of the current policy.PlatformQ1 2010 SubscriptionsYear-on-Year growth Q1’09-Q1’10DSL724,268+6.6%Cable163,455+44.7%FWA101,617-12.7%Other (Satellite and fibre)8,213-3.2%Mobile Broadband512,381+47.2%Total1,509,934+19.3%

The necessary consent for construction of a gas pipeline between the LNG terminal and the Irish gas transmission system was granted last year by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER has also approved a request by Shannon LNG for regulated Third Party Exemption for the terminal.  That decision must be endorsed by the European Commission and a decision is expected by mid July.Shannon LNG has applied for the requisite foreshore permissions, which are being processed by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I understand that draft documentation is with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for finalisation of legal agreements.Subject to receipt of the necessary foreshore consents the timescale for progressing the project is a matter for the Company.  Shannon LNG has indicated that subject to final corporate decisions on proceeding with the investment, the proposed facility would be developed on a phased basis with Phase 1 operational by 2015/2016.

As the Deputy is aware the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes outlined a wide range of proposals across all Departments, a number of which, if agreed to proceed, can only be achieved through restructuring over a number of years.  The consideration of the proposals for my Department and the Agencies under its aegis is ongoing and as the table shows, progress has been made in relation to certain proposals.  In addition, my Department has committed to current expenditure savings amounting to €13 million over the 2009 Estimate in 2010.Gross current expenditure in 2010 for my Department will be 3% below the 2009 outturn and expenditure on the Department's pay bill will be some 9% below the 2009 outturn. The details of the programme changes that are being made by my Department in order to achieve these savings for 2010 are as set out on pages E. 64 and E. 65 of the 2010 Estimates for Public Services and Summary Public Capital Programme.Savings outlined in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure ProgrammesMerge DHDA with EI/IDAReview of DHDA currently underwayMerge ComReg with BAINot implementedTransfer IFCO into BAITarget date of end of year for implementationPartially fund TG4 from TV LicenceNot included in Budget 2010 but direct Exchequer subvention to TG4 reduced by €2.083 millionTerminate DCENR/SEI energy awareness programmesSeparate budget for Energy Efficiency Awareness eliminated in Budget 2010 (€0.894 million saving)Rationalise multiplicity of energy efficiency schemes run by SEIBeing rationalised in the context of the multi-annual National Retrofit Programme announced in Budget 2010Transfer energy research funding to new single funding stream for all researchEnergy research function retainedReview operations of Bord na Móna to achieve optimal valueWill be done on an ongoing basis — any potential savings arising would not accrue to the ExchequerMerge OSi and the Valuation Office with the PRANot implementedSecure efficiencies/increased revenue worth 20% of GSI’s operating costsValue for Money Review of GSI underway to secure efficiencies/increased revenueSecure additional savings from the merger of the regional fisheries boardsMerger will take place in 2010 and direct Exchequer funding for Inland Fisheries reduced by €3.145 millionTransfer responsibility for Inland Fisheries from DCENR to DEHLGNot implementedReduce DCENR authorised number of civil servants by 30 postsDCENR has achieved targetReduce DCENR agency staff by 76Under ongoing consideration; new functions in some Agencies will impact on target

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.That mapping exercise found that at least one existing broadband supplier was already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ieIt continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

The legislative basis for the obligation is provided for in the Energy (Biofuels Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010.  This legislation will ensure that Irish consumers have access to appropriately priced, sustainable and reliable sources of biofuel over the coming years, and, in doing so, this will give an important incentive to domestic production.The National Biofuel Obligation will, by definition, incentivise the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market and will support indigenous biofuel producers and expand the sustainable indigenous production of biofuels.  The EU sustainability criteria, which were recently introduced, will also provide competitive advantage for Irish and other EU producers by ensuring that non EU imports meet strict environmental guidelines.The only correspondence I received from the individual in County Kilkenny referred to by the Deputy, related to a submission received as part of the consultation process on the Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  It was not my Department's intention to respond directly on each individual submission received.  All submissions received were analysed as part of the process of preparing the specific details of the National Biofuel Obligation Scheme.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1140	At the 2008 December Fisheries Council, restrictions on whitefish fishing in the west of Area VI (waters west of Donegal and off Scotland) were introduced for the first time under Council Regulation No. 43/2009.  These restrictions include establishing minimum mesh sizes to be used by vessels fishing in the west of area VIa and requiring that these vessels' fishing gear incorporate square mesh panels in certain circumstances.The Commission has made clear that it considers that these measures are essential for fisheries conservation.  These measures were also included as part of the EU Commission's broader 2008 proposal to harmonise Technical Conservation Measures (TCMs) for fisheries.  This proposal failed to be adopted during the Fisheries Council in November 2009, however.Following this development, a new proposal, which continued existing technical measures on a temporary basis (for 2010 and the first six months of 2011), was adopted at the end of November 2009.  The  adoption of  new TCMs will now be  a matter for  the Council and EU Parliament under the co-decision procedure.  The Commission has advised that it will bring forward new proposals in this regard in association with the Common Fisheries Policy reform proposals.During 2009, Ireland sought a number of practical changes Ireland to the  technical measures that would help alleviate their impacts on the Irish fleet.  The changes sought were based on discussions held with fishing industry representatives.  Minister of State Connick is continuing to work to deliver critical changes to the restrictions on the basis of a commitment from the EU Commission secured at the December 2008 Fisheries Council for a review and early amendment of the restrictions on whitefish fishing off Donegal.

The Fund was increased to provide €68.128 million in 2009 and an amount of €59.3 million has been provided for in 2010, with the cap on the Fund increased each year by Regulation in accordance with the provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.The level of the Fund for 2011 will be considered in the context of decisions on next year's estimates and the budget.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1142	The new Grassland Sheep Scheme, which has a total budget of €54 million, will operate for three years: 2010, 2011 and 2012. This funding, which comes from the unused Single Payment funds, will provide a very important and timely boost to support incomes in the sheep sector over the next three years .
The Scheme has been kept administratively simple, which will facilitate the Department in making payments very shortly after the commencement date of 1 December 2010 (the commencement date for making payments under this Scheme in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations). Farmers will find participating in the Scheme relatively easy, the three requirements being to:maintain ewes;complete the Sheep Census return and submit it by the deadline set by my Department; andsubmit the SPS application form by the closing date of 17th May 2010.The ewe numbers eligible for inclusion in the 2010 Scheme will be based on the numbers as declared in the 2009 Sheep Census.Applicants must maintain sheep on an ongoing basis to retain eligibility for the 2011 and 2012 Schemes, i.e. he or she has to have sheep to declare in their 2011 and 2012 Sheep Census Sheep Returns.  Applicants must also submit an SPS application each year to be eligible for the Scheme. The rate payable per hectare will be based on the number of 2010 SPS eligible hectares declared or area deemed eligible for payment, whichever is the lower, using two stocking densities as follows:2.5 ewes per hectare for Mountain Type Grazing Land (as defined under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme);7 ewes per hectare for all other lands (including Most Severely, Less Severely Disadvantaged Area and non-Disadvantaged Areas)The maximum area payable per Scheme-year is 84 hectares in respect of Mountain Type Grazing and 30 hectares for all other lands. The indicative rates of aid are as follows:Mountain Areas (0 to 20 hectares): €30 per hectare;Mountain Areas (20 to 84 hectares): €25 per hectare;Lowland Areas: €70 per hectare.The additional payment (total payable €100) is in recognition of the difficulties facing hill sheep farming. The supply of lambs is a key and fundamental element underpinning the sheep and lamb processing industry.  This is a hugely valuable export-orientated part of the Irish agri-food sector, supplying a high-value product to consumer markets throughout Europe.  The industry is worth around €250 million to the Irish economy and over two thirds of the product is exported.

The racing of horses on public roads would give rise in the first instance to public safety issues, which are a matter for An Garda Síochána and the respective Local Authority where the activity takes place. If the activity gives rise to concerns of cruelty of animals, it would be a matter for An Garda Síochána to deal with under the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and amendment Act 1965. These Acts empower the Garda to investigate and bring a prosecution against any person suspected of committing an offence under the legislation.

These restrictions included establishing minimum mesh sizes to be used by vessels fishing in the west of area VIa and requiring that these vessels' fishing gear incorporate square mesh panels in certain circumstances.  It also includes a ban on the use of certain fishing gears, including gill nets.In addition, EU Fisheries Councils in November 2008 adopted a new Cod Recovery Plan, as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1342/2008.  Under these Regulations, Ireland and other Member States were required to introduce and implement a licensing regime to manage limits on the number of days their vessels can fish in areas VIa (north west of Ireland) and VIIa (the Irish Sea) using specified gear types.  This regime only applies to vessels greater than 10 metres in length.At the time in later 2008, the original proposals from the EU Commission called for the complete closure of all whitefish fisheries in the waters off Donegal, given scientific advice that cod, whiting and haddock stocks in these waters were in a serious state of decline.  Following intensive negotiations, concessions were agreed that permitted the use of certain gears.  These restrictions are set down in EU Regulation 1288 /2009 establishing transitional technical measures from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011.During 2009, Ireland sought a number of practical changes Ireland to the  technical measures that would help alleviate their impacts on the Irish fleet.  The changes sought were based on discussions held with fishing industry representatives.  However, as gill nets are considered appropriate gear for the targeting of cod and haddock, it was considered unlikely that the EU Commission would permit this type of fishing gear in the specified area.Minister of State Connick is continuing to work to deliver critical changes to the restrictions on the basis of a commitment from the EU Commission secured at the December 2008 Fisheries Council for a review and early amendment of the restrictions on whitefish fishing off Donegal.

The lower 2010 budget provision reflects a combination of factors including lower administration costs, the closure of certain schemes to new applicants, the introduction of lower payment rates, lower levels of funding to discharge outstanding liabilities under existing schemes and lower provision for once-off items such as the cost of the pigmeat recall measures.  Staff salaries has fallen from €233 million in 2008 to €197 million (estimated) in 2010.  Staffing levels are projected to fall from 4,800 in 2004 to 3,717  by the end of 2010. The reduction arises from a combination of circumstances (moratorium on recruitment, the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement and redeployment to other Departments).The Department keeps all elements of expenditure under close review, including consideration of the recommendations of the report by the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  Future funding for schemes and services, as well as the Administrative Budget for the Department, will be decided in the context of the preparation of the annual Estimate on an on-going basis.* This excludes budget totalling €26.476 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, responsibility for which was transferred to the Department in May 2010.

Until the end of 2008, funding was provided by my Department to local authority librarians to enable them to provide library services for pupils enrolled in primary schools in individual local authority areas. However, this funding was withdrawn in 2009 as a result of the more challenging economic environment and the need to prudently manage Exchequer resources. A saving of €2.19m resulted from the cessation of this funding.The Deputy will be aware that Boards of Management may allocate their combined capitation and ancillary funding according to the priorities of the school.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1180	The Leaving Certificate in Ireland is a centrally organised final examination which is examined by external examiners. This situation is in stark contrast to the position in other countries where the suite of assessment methodology includes a significant element of school-based assessment of students undertaken by the class teachers, and in doing so provides a template where there is capacity and flexibility to respond to cases where students are unable due to adversity or trauma to complete their examinations.Each year the certificate examinations give rise to many situations where a real human factor must be balanced against the requirements of fairness to the general body of students.  At the certificate examinations each student's work must be marked according to the common marking scheme for the subject concerned.  This is to ensure equitable, consistent and fair treatment for all candidates.Within the constraints of our system, every possible effort is made by the SEC to accommodate candidates who suffer illness, bereavement or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations.  Each year, arrangements are made to cater for a wide range of emergencies. These include special sittings in venues such as hospitals and alterations to the standard examination timetable. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also on hand to assist schools and students in crisis situations during examinations.  While the limitations of this approach are fully recognised, a range of alternatives have been considered and been found not to be feasible in dealing with this issue.In particular, the question of offering a repeat examination has been explored a number of times, and it has been concluded that this is not possible within the constraints of a centrally organised externally examined system. The length of the school year, the 13 day timescale needed for holding examinations, the supply of examiners, the timely supply of results to the CAO system for higher level admission, the appeal process, the marking of the Junior Certificate, the difficulty in identifying fair and equitable criteria governing eligibility to enter for repeat examinations, and the likely demand for repeat options for all candidates who seek them, are all constraints. In the final analysis, it is difficult to see a fair, proper and impartial system of repeat examinations without allowing all applicants to repeat their tests.The matter will be kept under review taking account of international practice.

Parents seeking enrolment should apply to the Board of Management of schools with such early intervention classes.  My Department has no role in the enrolment of children in specific schools.  Where a child with autism, aged 3 years or older, cannot access such a placement, my Department provides funding to parents/guardians for a programme of home tuition.  My Department has noted the name and address in question and will issue a home tuition application form to the parents in August.However, the parents should contact the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to obtain advice on placement options.  The Deputy is aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.SENOs are a valuable resource in assisting parents with regard to their child's special educational needs and placement options.

The application has been assessed and assigned a Band 2 rating, in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for major capital projects operated by my Department.The school currently has a staffing level of 3 mainstream teachers and also has the shared services of one Learning Support Teacher and one Resource Teacher.  In 2009, the school had 80 pupils, which means that the school will not be allocated an additional mainstream teaching post for September 2010 and therefore, no deficit of mainstream classroom accommodation currently exists.Earlier this year, the school authority applied for grant aid to replace an existing temporary mainstream classroom and resource room.  As these were installed in 2007, it was considered that they should be in sufficiently good condition that they did not need to be replaced at this time.  Therefore, the application was not approved.  In general, the replacement of temporary accommodation is approved only where the temporary accommodation is significantly aged or in poor repair.  The staffing schedule for September 2011 will be confirmed in light of enrolments in the school in the coming school year.  At that point, it is open to the school authority to apply for additional accommodation, if this is required.

The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Students with official refugee status in the State who meet the criteria of the scheme may also be considered under the Free Fees Initiative.It is the students own nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Free Fees scheme. The assessment of eligibility under the Free Fees Initiative in individual cases is a matter for each higher education institution to determine within the terms of the scheme.  Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees initiative such students must pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third level institution. Such institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, the level of fees to be charged in such cases is a matter for the institutions. In that regard, Section 473A, of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education in the State and any other E.U. Member State.

These Circulars specify that the minimum requirement necessary for appointment is an award of Grade D (or pass) in Irish, English and Mathematics in the Intermediate Certificate/Junior Certificate or Day Vocational Certificate Examination or in an examination of equivalent standard. In this context, a qualification of equivalent standard is any qualification at Level 3 or higher of National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), provided that the qualification, or a combination of such qualifications, certifies to the achievement of a minimum of a pass in the subjects Irish, English and Mathematics.Boards of Management of schools are the employers of all staff, including SNAs, employed in schools. State funding of any SNA position is granted on the basis of agreed recruitment policies and guidelines being adhered to by Boards of Management and these being applied in a fair and consistent manner in all cases. The minimum educational standard required for these positions is based on the needs of the SNA post generally across all schools and it is not open to schools to deviate from this standard in individual cases.

This level of provision will be maintained for the coming 2010/2011 academic year.The overall number of approved PLC places is set at its current level because there is a continuing requirement to plan and control public service numbers and to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision.  The approved PLC centre referred to by the Deputy is operated by Cavan VEC.  Cavan VEC was allocated a total of 1,210 PLC places for the 2009/2010 academic year (including 60 of the 1,500 additional places) and this level of provision is being maintained for the 2010/2011 academic year.Learners apply directly to individual schools and colleges for places on PLC programmes and my Department does not receive details of such applications.  In the context of demand for upskilling and retraining, is important not to view PLC provision in isolation from other programmes that provide for upskilling and retraining. It is estimated that over 170,000 learners will avail of part-time and full-time further education programmes in 2010.  Alongside further education provision, in 2010 FÁS will provide 147,000 training and work experience places for the unemployed. This compares to the 66,000 equivalent places that were delivered in 2008.  In addition, the total number of full-time enrolments in universities and institutes of technology is estimated at more than 150,000 for the 2009/2010 academic year.

The primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course, including a two year infant cycle followed by six years in standards from first to sixth, with children progressing to the next grade at the end of each school year. Pupils commencing school for the first time should be enrolled at the commencement of the school year in order to complete the full primary school course.I have been informed by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) that under the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which started in January 2010 children will normally qualify to participate in the scheme where they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September of each year.  Exceptions to the  upper age limit will be allowed where children are assessed by the HSE as having special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  The provision of a 15 month age range for eligibility is designed to give flexibility to parents to access the scheme at the most appropriate time for their children prior to commencing school and the majority of children who participate in the scheme would be expected to commence primary school between the age of 4 years 3 months and 5 years 6 months.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.1 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.  In the meantime, it is open to the school management to apply to my Department for temporary accommodation to meet any shortfall in its immediate accommodation needs.

The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Students with official refugee status in the State who meet the criteria of the scheme may also be considered under the Free Fees Initiative.Under the terms of the scheme, a student is not eligible for free tuition fees in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not free fees applied previously. This rule will not be affected by the Student Support Bill.  Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees initiative such students must pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third level institution. Such institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, the level of fees to be charged in such cases is a matter for the institutions. In that regard, Section 473A, of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education in the State and any other E.U. Member State.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1198	I refer the Deputy to my earlier answer to parliamentary question number 188 of 16 June 2010 for an explanation of the how the procedures for school placements operate under the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.Under the Education (Welfare) Act the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) an officer of the NEWB for the parent's home area is aware of this case and is currently working with the parents to obtain a school place for their child.  I understand from recent communications which officials of my Department have had with the local EWO that the parents have recently applied to a post-primary school in Co. Kildare and the school concerned is currently considering their application.My Department operates two different schemes for home tuition. The first scheme is for children with special educational needs or with a medical condition who are without a school place. The records of my Department show that the parents applied both in 2008/09 and 2009/10 for Home Tuition for their child under the terms of this scheme. These applications were refused as there was a school place available for the child. The parents separately applied under this scheme to have home tuition extended for the month of July. This application was refused as the parents still had the offer of a school place. It is open to the parents to appeal this decision to my Department.In November, 2008 the parents were granted home tuition of 9 hours per week under the second home tuition scheme which operates as a temporary interim compensatory educational measure for children  as they had commenced an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act against another school who had refused enrolment for their child. Originally this home tuition sanction was extended to cover a period where court proceedings taken in connection with this appeal were before the courts. The sanction was further extended while the parents took a second appeal against a different school. Both appeals were unsuccessful. My Department was then informed that the parents had obtained a school place in Co. Leitrim for their child and would be taking this up in 2010/11. In light of this and the period for which the child was out of school home tuition of 9 hours per week was extended to the end of the current school year on an exceptional basis to facilitate resolution of the case.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1199	The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The National Educational Welfare Board will be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement.  Where a child is without a school placement, their parents or guardians may apply to my Department for Home Tuition to assist in providing for their child's education, as an interim measure, pending the sourcing of a school place.

Guidelines have been issued by my Department to support schools in this process. In some schools, the programme is compulsory for all students. In those that offer it as an option, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of it.It is the board of management of each individual school that decides the number of places available to students on programmes such as Transition Year. In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.There were 730 recognised post-primary schools in 2009/10 of which 555 (76%) offered the Transition Year programme.  The number of students enrolled in the Transition Year programme during 2009/2010 was 28,657 (9% of the total mainstream cohort).  My Department does not hold statistics on which schools have the programme compulsory for their pupils.External evaluations of the Transition Year programme are carried our as part of the Inspectorate's annual programme of inspections in post-primary schools. In the period December 2007 to June 2010 the Inspectorate published individual inspection reports relating to the operation of the Transition Year programme in 32 post-primary schools. These reports may be accessed on the Department's website (www.education.ie). The reports present findings relating to the quality of programme organisation and coordination in each school, the quality of programme planning, the quality of teaching and learning, and the quality of the school's evaluation and assessment processes. In addition, schools have a responsibility to ensure that their coordinating teams for Transition Year undertake self-reviews of their work in close collaboration with the school's management, leadership, staff and wider school community.While quantitative analysis relating to the 32 published programme evaluation reports has not been undertaken, comprehensive evaluations of the Transition Year programme have been conducted by the Inspectorate of my Department in

The Board provides fair and reasonable awards to victims of institutional childhood abuse.  It is wholly independent in the performance of its functions and over the last seven years has dealt with over 13,800 cases, resulting in over 13,000 awards being accepted by applicants.   As the Deputy will be aware, in addition to establishing the Commission and the redress board, the Government established the National Counselling Service to assist victims cope with their experiences together with a family tracing service to assist former residents trace their families of origin and educational services for former residents and their families. The final cost of the response to residential institutional abuse is estimated to reach €1.36 billion.The Ryan Report found a much more systemic volume of abuse in institutions than was previously known or accepted by the religious Congregations and the Government and subsequently Dáil Éireann called on the Congregations to commit to making further substantial contributions by way of reparation.  In addition to the original €128 million contribution under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, the Congregations are now offering significant additional contributions, which they have valued at €348.51 m. More detailed work and discussion with the Congregations will be required in relation to the detail of the property offers.The Government has proposed to utilise the cash element of the Congregations' offers of contributions which is intended to amount to €110 m over the next few years, to establish a Statutory Fund in keeping with the all-party Motion passed by Dáil Éireann, supporting the proposal for a Trust for the support of victims and to other education and welfare purposes.   Following consultation with the Congregations and the former residents as to the exact nature of the fund, how it will operate and the uses to which it will be put, the arrangements for the Statutory Fund will be considered by the Government. This Fund, which will be to support the needs of survivors is separate and distinct from the compensation scheme operated by the independent Residential Institutions Redress Board, which provides fair and reasonable awards to victims of institutional childhood abuse. The Statutory Fund will not provide additional compensation to former residents.Having considered the report of the independent Panel appointed to assess statements of their affairs submitted by the Congregations and the response of the Congregations, the Government's view is that the overall costs of the response to residential institutional abuse should be shared on a 50:50 basis between the taxpayer and those responsible for the residential institutions.  Assuming that the Congregations' offers of contributions are fully realised, the collective contribution of the Congregations would be €476.51 m, leaving a target of over €200 m to reach the 50% share of some €680 m. The Government has requested that additional contributions be provided to the greatest degree possible in cash as a contribution to the planned National Children's Hospital.The position in relation to the €128 contribution under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement is that it comprises of €10 million towards the provision of counselling services. The remainder comprises of cash and property. Of the €54.4 provided in cash to date, €12.7 million is being used by the Education Finance Board which provides educational grants to former residents and their families. The remaining cash was used towards the payment of redress awards to former residents by the Residential Institutions Redress Board.

These are the Higher Education Grants (HEG) Scheme, the  Vocational Education Committees' (VEC) Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees (TLT) and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses (PLC).  The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  In order to qualify for financial assistance under the maintenance grant schemes operated by my Department, a person must pursue a full-time undergraduate course, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at an approved third level institution.Under the free fees initiative, the Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses which must be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.Distance learning courses are regarded as part-time programmes of study.  Accordingly such courses are not included under the maintenance grant schemes.

It is available to all special schools and mainstream schools with special classes catering for children with autism.  Where school-based provision is not available, parents may apply for home-based tuition.  There has been a steady increase in the number of schools offering the programme since its introduction.  Applications this year have increased by approximately 20% in comparison to 2009 to almost 2,100.In 2009, in order to improve the service to parents and schools, a common pay date was introduced, for both school-based and home-based programmes. In 2010, the common pay date has been changed from 30 September, as in 2009, to 11 November.This decision was made after consideration of available staffing resources within my Department.

Details of the funding were notified to schools by circulars 0041/2010 (second level) and 0043/2010 (first level).I have allocated this funding on a per capita basis as follows: Primary DEIS €21, Primary non-DEIS €11, Post-primary DEIS €39,Post-primary non-DEIS €24.  The previous system required schools to apply each year to my Department, which resulted in a significant administrative burden, both for schools and my Department.The new funding mechanism is part of a process of moving to a more streamlined system where, instead of several specific grants, schools, which are best placed to know the needs of their pupils, receive one per capita grant that they can assign according to the priorities of the school.  I have urged schools to put in place book rental schemes as the most effective way to reduce costs for all parents.Funding for book grants was withdrawn in 2009, except in the case of DEIS schools.  Funding has been re-instated in 2010 for all schools.The specific funding allocations requested by the Deputy are as follows:YearAmount€200612,995,966200714,257,084200814,421,56320097,000,000201014,671,063

In these circumstances, from September 2010, as announced in the budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes.  Students progressing to a new course with effect from 2010-11 will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.The Minister for Social Protection and I have discussed the particular impact of the decision on the students referred to by the Deputy (ie. those who in 2010 have or are in process of completing their access course) in the context of implementation of these changes and the matter is being examined by both Departments.

Students are eligible to be considered for grant assistance in respect of one approved PLC Course.  Clause 3.2 of the PLC scheme sets out the circumstances under which grant assistance may be awarded in respect of subsequent study at PLC Level — i.e. where a  candidate already holds a qualification, no higher than FETAC Level 5, and is now pursuing a course that offers progression which may be deemed eligible for grant aid.

The school's application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria of my Department and the application has been assigned a band rating of 1.4.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of the current competing demands on the capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
