#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to comment on reports that the child health screening programme, last revised in 2004, is being undertaken in a haphazard fashion, resulting in many children, especially those in rural areas, failing to receive hearing, oral, dental and vision checks as considered appropriate under the programme, and the need for the Minister to provide statistics of the coverage achieved by the programme since 2000.I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the position on an extension to Ballylanders national school in County Limerick.I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to give an update on the 1999 task force report for County Donegal and the July 2006 interdepartmental report on jobs.I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government to encourage and support the joint efforts of the trustees of Muckross House and the National Parks and Wildlife Service in carrying out a comprehensive botanical survey of Innisfallen Island with a view to obtaining the fullest information on the ancient monastic settlement and the lives of the monks, especially in regard to their cultivation of the island gardens thereon and detailing the plants, shrubs and herbs with medicinal properties.I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason there is currently a 12 to 18-month waiting list for children to see a speech and language therapist in the Carlow area; the number on the waiting list for County Carlow; if there are private speech language therapists in the Carlow area; and if a similar situation of children waiting to see an occupational therapist also exists in County Carlow.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators John Paul Phelan, Finucane and McHugh and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Coghlan and Browne may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.

As well as this, the gentleman in charge of the affordable homes project wrote to me about comments made by some Senators on the issue during a mini debate here.  He asked me to convey his reply to each of the Senators.  I have copied his reply and it is available on the table in the ante room for Senators.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Since last week's rather embarrassing U-turn on economic policy by Fianna Fáil, it is clear the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has been sent to Coventry.  However, I did not think that included non-attendance in the Seanad.  Last night's Second Stage debate of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill was like a scene from Mary Poppins, with approximately five different Ministers popping in and out during the course of the debate, while the Minister was nowhere to be found to hear the views of the six Members who spoke on this important Bill.  The Minister is rarely in the House because we have little legislation from his Department here.Unless there is a guarantee from the Leader and the Government side of the House that the Minister will be in the House to take Committee Stage of the Bill today, we will not participate in the debate and I will oppose the Order of Business.  It is not good enough that a Minister who sponsors a Bill is not in the House for debate on it.  Three excellent contributions were made by Fianna Fáil Senators last night, two by Fine Gael and one by a member of the Labour Party, yet the Minister was not——

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I apologise.  It is so easy to forget about the blessed Trinity from time to time.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Perhaps the Senator's contribution was not excellent.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The point is the Minister was not in the House.  We are not going to participate in a sham debate today if he is not in the House to participate in it.  I put the Leader on notice of that.  I know it is not her problem.  In fairness, she orders the business and expects Ministers to be present.  The Minister should have been in the House yesterday.  I expect that in response to my question, he will be here today.  If not, we will oppose the Order of Business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The reason the Minister was unable to attend is personal.  If he is available today, he will be in the House.  I am not sure if what constrained him yesterday will allow him be in the Chamber today.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	10	All right.  The Leader will get back on that.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I propose that if the Leader is not clear on whether the Minister will be in the House, No. 2 should not be ordered.  I want clarity on this because we will not participate otherwise.  My colleague, Senator Terry, has tabled 12 amendments to the Bill and will not cite those amendments to a Minister who does not have a clue about the contents of the legislation and who is not even in the Department.  That is not acceptable in the House.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	12	All right.  I call Senator O'Toole.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business received a disturbing report this morning about the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region.  I called recently for debates on regional areas such as Kerry.  The BMW includes the Leader's area.  The report reaches disturbing conclusions, the most annoying of which is that every operational programme under the national development plan for that area has been underspent.  The Department of Finance says this is because the National Roads Authority decided to prioritise the eastern region to deal with bottlenecks there and told the BMW region to go and whistle.It is a disgrace that money is available but withdrawn because the regional authorities cannot get enough consultants or whoever they need to build the infrastructure.  Someone should explain to us why this extraordinary situation has arisen in areas such as Mayo, north Galway and other places, including the Leader's area.  There are other problems in the area such as brain drain.  Is this happening throughout the country?  Are there also projects in the Cork and Kerry region the funds for which are not being drawn down?  What happens to the money at the end of the year?  It is wrong that the money is not maintained in the region.  We need to do something about it.  The road plans in the west are moving on but they are three or four years behind.  Why is this money not available?  Why are more people not making noise about it?  I would like to have a discussion on this issue.  It is appalling that we are not dealing with it.A report was issued recently to the effect that there are almost 300 cases pending against the Department of Education and Science on issues to do with education and educational rights and so on.  There is something out of kilter when the Department and the Minister challenge every one of these.  What is happening?  I am sure some of those cases should be challenged but not every one of them.  It puts people under serious pressure.  I heard recently of a case in which the parents of an autistic child went to the High Court 29 times until they got approval for the support they wanted for the child to get primary level education.  As soon as the child finished primary school they had to start the process again and are still going through it for post-primary education.  That is cruel pressure.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	27	In the past five years, the Opposition and the Leader have managed to work effectively through the business of the House by agreement.  If a Minister cannot be present and we accept the bona fides of his or her reason for that, it is easy to ask the leaders of the Opposition groups to agree to reschedule a Bill, especially if no qualified Minister of State is available.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Minister is attending.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The legislation being discussed yesterday has nothing much to do with increasing social welfare payments but incorporates the most extraordinary proposal I have seen in many years.  This will institutionalise social segregation by saying that rent supplement cannot be paid for housing in development areas.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	In development areas?

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	35	There was no Minister to hear it.  That is my point.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	It can be raised on Committee Stage today.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	37	That puts a snob's charter into legislation.  Developers can advertise there will be no "grotties", so to speak, in the development and people can afford to invest.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	38	That is a matter to be discussed on the legislation.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Fianna Fáil should be ashamed of itself.  I would like to say that to the Minister.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Fianna Fáil brought in Part V and the Senator and his colleagues opposed.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	41	We did not oppose it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Fianna Fáil diluted it as well.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I would like to have some order on the Order of Business.  Senators are entitled to make their contributions if they are in order.  The Chair will decide whether they are in order.  I would like fewer interruptions while Senators make contributions so that we will have an orderly Order of Business.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I apologise through the Chair to the Fianna Fáil Members for provoking them.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	45	We are not a bit put out.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I apologise but sometimes they upset me.  I call for a debate on the creeping privatisation of public services, for example, psychological services for schools in Dublin.  I discovered yesterday that some schools are given money and told to buy the service and their allocation of psychological support is withdrawn.  That is privatisation.  What is happening on the grounds of public hospitals is also privatisation, no matter what the Government calls it.  Now there is a threat to hand over the Cork Maternity Hospital to the private sector as if it belonged to the Health Service Executive and not to the people.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	48	It does not belong to the Irish Nurses Organisation either.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I have suspended the Order of Business already.  The Senators should not ask me to suspend it again or I will ask the Leader to reply and dispense with the Order of Business altogether.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	50	We should also urgently debate the housing market because there are signs of a problem.  I heard yesterday that 75% of people living in apartments do not like living in apartments.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I am getting no co-operation, high, dry or holy, in trying to get the Order of Business through and I would like co-operation.  We have always had an orderly Order of Business.  If there is no co-operation I will ask the Leader to reply and we will move on to the business of the day.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I apologise if I have behaved in a disorderly fashion in the least way.  I did not intend to do so.  There is a serious issue about the housing market, the fact that it is not matching people's aspirations and that although it is failing, it appears as if the whole market is in trouble.  Those issues deserve to be debated and I ask the Leader to organise the debate.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I beg the Cathaoirleach's indulgence as I raise an issue again on the Order of Business.  I will try to do so in an orderly and calm manner.  Yesterday evening, 112 people in Galway city and county were sick as a result of the water infection in the city.  That affects 112 families and the number is rising.  This is a national emergency because it means that if one puts an apple into a child's lunch box or makes a salad, these foods must be washed in boiled water.  If one puts one's children in the bath one must tell them not to mess around, not to drink the water or get it into their mouths.There are large employers in Galway city which make a significant contribution to the economy.  Every employer is obliged under health and safety legislation to provide safe drinking water to his or her employees.  Employers in Galway must now buy tonnes of bottled water to provide to their employees.There are cancellations in the tourism industry because tourists believe it is not safe to go to Galway.  We need a national plan and a national commitment to make funding available for the region.  We need to concentrate for 24 hours per day, seven days per week, on finding a solution and we need to know what is to happen.  We cannot afford to wait for the drip feed of information from Galway City Council and the Health Service Executive.I am not proposing an amendment to the Order of Business but pleading with the Leader to make some provision for a five-minute debate today with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There are a number of Members from Galway present and they will note this is a matter of national importance and an emergency.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	55	That is really a matter for the local authority, as the Deputy probably knows.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	56	As a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I associate myself strongly with and support the remarks of Senator O'Toole.  Deputy McHugh's excellent report was adopted unanimously this morning, as was another excellent report by Senator Leyden.  On the BMW issue, the circumstances are frightful and we all suspected there were problems.I recently spoke in the House about the peripherality of Kerry and the changes that were made to certain roads programmes without consulting anyone on the ground in the county.  In this regard, it now appears that the stretch of land from Donegal to Kerry, right down through the midlands, is probably affected.  This was proven this morning and the reports were agreed unanimously by the members of the committee, the majority of whom were obviously from the Government side.  The discrimination is frightful and shocking and needs to be addressed urgently.  I hope the issue is highlighted and brought before the Government for immediate redress.What are the plans of the Government regarding the potential unconstitutionality of the Electoral Act, which discriminates against candidates affiliated to parties as opposed to Independent candidates?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Senator should explain.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	58	As matters stand, any party in any constituency can send out only one litir um thoghchán no matter how many of its members are running for election.  This will affect the Leader and everyone else attached to a party.  A party member must send out a letter jointly with one's colleague whereas an Independent candidate can sent out one letter devoted solely to himself.  This seems to discriminate against party members and the Government should address it.  If the Leader has a view on it, she might inform the House.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Order, please.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Senator O'Toole mentioned the document launched this morning by Deputy McHugh at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  It is worthy of debate in this House.  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate my document on the effectiveness of Irish trade promotion abroad and the state agencies involved.  I will be launching it at 12 noon in the audiovisual room and the Senators are all welcome to attend.Will the Leader consider a debate on An Post, particularly on the fact that only 72% of deliveries are made the next day?  Only Greece, Latvia and Cyprus have poorer records than Ireland.  As a former Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I am disappointed that instead of delivering 92% of mail the next day, An Post is delivering only 72%.  This is not very satisfactory and therefore the management of An Post should be examined.I am very concerned about the threat to 500 local post offices and genuinely believe we should retain and develop the ones we have.  This is possible given the new technology that is available.  I am very concerned about this issue because it has affected rural Ireland and will affect my own parish, which has its own post office.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for the five-minute sos because it allowed me to pick up the statement on affordable homes.  I understand why the head of the Affordable Homes Partnership would object to the suggestion about brown envelopes.  I do not know who made the suggestion but it certainly was not me.  However, the head has missed the point because we were talking about the fact that many of the homes do not seem to be affordable and are for people who have very considerable incomes.  A joint income of €75,000 is not inconsiderable and the homes were meant for nurses and others such employees on approximately €32,000.  Homes are not being provided for individuals in this category.  The homes are granted by lottery but the people who have entered are never told when it is held or the result unless they win a house.  This does not suggest the existence of transparency and accountability.On a related matter raised by Senator Ryan, there was a very good debate last night on the Social Welfare Bill during which I made the point that not only is it snobbish to exclude people on rent supplement from the nice little areas so they will not discommode those who can afford to buy homes therein, it is also a form of apartheid.  It was I who used the word "apartheid".  Focus Ireland said of this matter that, for the first time, there is in primary legislation a legal mechanism that prohibits specific categories of people from living in certain areas.  The Cathaoirleach knows as well as I do that this is apartheid.

Could we have a debate on health?  Could the Leader raise with the Minister for Health and Children the fact that the Government now proposes to take most of the disability allowance from those with a mental disability who are staying in residential homes?  This is just like what caused the scandal over nursing home charges.At the weekend, the Government promised a great splurge of benefits and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in his speech last night outlined all the Government is doing for the disabled, but it gives with one hand and takes away with the other.  The disability allowance is now to be paid directly to the residential facility, thus by-passing the carers and leaving the recipients with only €35.  This is a miserable pittance with which to pay for all one's needs.  Many carers and family members of the disabled are really concerned about this.  Will the Leader obtain some information on this matter from the Department of Health and Children?  I can make mine available to her.  We are walking into another situation similar to that which caused the scandal over nursing home charges.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Last week on the Order of Business I requested a debate on the quality of water in Galway city and county and I support Senator Cox in her call for such a debate.  I understand that over 112 people have been made ill  by the water and that the notice that one should boil it could be on display until next October unless the issue is resolved.  I am very disappointed that very little has been done by Galway City Council or the Health Service Executive.  However, I commend Galway County Council on the fact that it is to take water from outside Headford town to supply its population.This morning's newspapers stated the people benefiting from the Caherlistrane water scheme said they would be delighted to provide water to the town of Headford.  It is a bit like the GAA offering Croke Park for soccer and rugby, even if only on a temporary basis.  I hope we will have a similar resolution to the problem affecting Galway city.  It is very serious and there seems to be no attempt to provide an alternative supply.I hope we can have a debate on water quality.  This problem has gone on for far too long and it is my understanding it could continue until October.  We must find a solution urgently.  If it means more funding for the BMW area, I will support what Senator O'Toole proposed.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Emergency legislation concerning risk equalisation in the health insurance market was passed in the House recently.  At the time, we were advised the Minister for Health and Children was introducing the legislation to plug a potential loophole in the health insurance market.  However, we are not surprised to hear from Commissioner McCreevy that the European Commission remains concerned, not about risk equalisation, but about competition in the Irish health insurance market and the fact the dominant player — the VHI — is being protected at a cost to other smaller firms.  This is the kernel of the issue.Do we want competition and to encourage new entrants into the market?  The Government has a lot to answer for, because the recent rushed emergency legislation hinders rather than helps competition.  In the time remaining, we should reflect on the matter of health insurance and how this House can ensure we protect the consumer and provide choice in the market.

This is becoming a wider problem.  Obviously there is an acute problem with water quality in Galway but the issue of security of supply also arises in other parts of the country.  It ought not to be a problem in a country with as much water, rain and lakes as we have, but, nonetheless, it will need much higher political attention in the future.I am in favour of balanced regional development, but if one takes the motorway to Kinnegad, are we saying that is not of benefit to the people of the west even though it is situated——

We read only yesterday about the opposition to the western rail corridor on the basis that it would make a loss but, nonetheless, the Government is committed to going ahead with that project.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I share the concerns of all those who spoke about water pollution.  Senator Mansergh said we should not have this problem because of the large supply of water in the country.  To a significant degree, the cause of the problem in the west is due to flood waters which, unfortunately, have got into the drinking water supply.Earlier this month, Senators will have read in newspapers of a tragic case where two young women, both mothers of two, had a fight in a shop in Laytown which ended with one of them dead and the other subsequently convicted of manslaughter.  During the course of the trial, the former national school principal of the girl who had been killed pointed out that she had been disruptive at school and that he had repeatedly tried to get psychological assessments for her but they were delayed for years. The situation was so serious he wrote to the school board stating she was a danger to the safety of other pupils in the school.Senator Ryan raised the issue of psychological assessments.  As far as I can ascertain, the National Educational Psychological Assessment Service has collapsed in a considerable number of schools and withdrawn in some cases.  Any attempts to get information from the Department of Education and Science are non-satisfactory.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate this extremely serious issue.  If children do not get the support they need at an early age, who knows what effect it may have on their later lives?
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I join other Senators in calling for a debate on the affordable housing scheme.  While an issue exists in terms of the supply of affordable housing, issues also arise in regard to the objective criteria used.  In particular, I am concerned that people whose incomes are below a certain threshold are being excluded.  These are the kinds of people we would want to get affordable homes.  I am aware of individuals and couples whose incomes are in the region of €30,000 per annum but because the criteria requires a multiplier of four and a half times their salaries, they do not qualify.  A salary of €30,000 would mean a total of only €135,000.  Unfortunately, there are not enough houses in this price range in the affordable schemes.In effect, people require an income of between €40,000 and €50,000 to be in a position to get one of these homes.  We need to examine this matter seriously because it is the people who are making an effort and living on a relatively low wage, between €20,000 and €30,000, whom we should be trying to assist.  We can then consider those in the higher income brackets of up to €60,000, which in this day and age is not an excessive amount of money for a joint application.  As well as addressing the issue of supply, we must examine the criteria being used to ensure that whatever way we distribute these houses, it is to the benefit of those most in need.

There may be a problem with class size here that is giving rise to unruly behaviour.Senator O'Toole referred to the Border, midlands and western region.  He made the point that it has not been highlighted.  My colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, has raised this matter on a monthly, if not weekly, basis since this House was constituted.  We already know the figures.  In the mid-term review of 2003, there was an underspend of €400 million.

Anybody working in the Civil Service or in policy who thinks constant reinvestment in the east will provide a solution to the mass urbanisation and traffic congestion is wrong.  The solution lies in investing in infrastructure in the west.  If we can provide critical access to the west, the north west and the south west in terms of roads, infrastructure, ports and airports, we will offer a solution to people in the east.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Not everything can be solved by legislation.  The work of the task force on active citizenship deserves a great deal of attention but one aspect that can be examined, not by legislation, is the figures that were published last week showing that a large number of children go to bed hungry.  Those children are not from families that are less well off.  Many of them are from families who are well off and whose parents are cash rich but time poor.  They do so because they do not have a family meal at home.  That is a worthy issue on which to concentrate our efforts.  It does not arise from legislation but from a drive by the community.  The issue of families having meals at home has been highlighted in the United States and a campaign has begun on that because they realise that those families who eat together at least once a week have fewer drug, alcohol or smoking addictions in later life and achieve better examination results.  It is something we as a nation should concentrate on not by way of legislation but perhaps by way of the task force on active citizenship.Yesterday we discussed the drama and the horror of what happened on the roads in fog and the behaviour of drivers.  We can do something about the number of road deaths if we can change our behaviour.  I have mentioned in the House previously that there were 10,000 road deaths per year in France until they elected a President who appointed Mr. Sarkozy who took hold of that challenge and reduced the number of deaths from 10,000 to 5,000 per year by enforcement of the law and by taking a number of sensible, intelligent measures on the roads.  I believe we can do those in this country.One of the measures that convinced me of the effectiveness of it is the lines of approximately 15 metres in length on the side of the motorways indicating that one must keep that distance between one's car and the car in front.  If somebody breaks the speed limit and overtakes on those lines, they are breaking the law.  Enforcement of the law managed to achieve the success in reducing the number of road deaths and we can do that in Ireland if we give the issue a sufficiently high priority.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Will the Leader schedule the debate I called for some time ago arising from the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on the issue of collusion.  Previously, the Leader stated that until the MacEntee commission of investigation reported, it might be inopportune to proceed with that debate.  That report is now with the Government and the Attorney General and I understand it may be released next week.  In any event, Mr. MacEntee's terms of reference did not include collusion.  The recommendation on collusion was that there would be a public inquiry in Northern Ireland where the various people involved, including witnesses, could be called.  It is a scandal that the British authorities participated in the murder of innocent civilians in this State and in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.Will the Leader schedule a debate on partnership?  The reference earlier to the Cork Maternity Hospital clearly illustrates that the substantial increases people in the public service received, not least within the health services, have resulted in a kamikaze disregard for taxpayers and the users of the health services in pursuit of their own self interest.  That is not acceptable.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Education and Science be facilitated to come to the House to clarify, for all the partners in education, the position regarding the fall-out from the recent decision in the Louise O'Keeffe law case.  The Minister and the Department have washed their hands of responsibility in this case, and that is not good enough.  The onus is on the Minister to come to the House and clarify the position for all the partners.  A situation has arisen where many members of boards of management are querying why and for how long they can remain on those boards.  That the letter was sent out by the Chief State Solicitor's office, at the behest of the State Claims Agency, in advance of Louise O'Keeffe knowing about it is no excuse for abdicating responsibility to her.  When we compare the obligations on her now with the obligations the then Minister, Deputy Woods, had in 2002 regarding the religious and what happened in that case, how can we reconcile the current Minister's position?

Regarding what Senator O'Toole raised, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, had an underspend of €50 million in his section of responsibility.  That money would have gone a long way towards the maintenance of the water courses in that area and alleviated the problems being experienced.

We should debate also the shared ownership scheme which has made a major difference to the lives of many young couples.

I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be asked to come to the House in the dying days of the Seanad to discuss the issue of the Director of Public Prosecutions who can be slow to progress cases.  On Pat Kenny's radio show many victims expressed their frustration.  In some instances their cases were not heard.  In one case a lady whose abuser confessed to the crime was not prosecuted because of the time delay involved.  People have come to see me who have cases pending and it is next to impossible to find out when the case will be heard.  The local gardaí will say they are waiting to hear from the DPP.  The DPP will not return calls.  It is not a proper system.  I realise there must be some separation in that respect but there should be some accountability as well.The e-mail facility in the House has a spam system, for good reason, but the Ray D'Arcy radio show did an item recently on VAT on condoms.  An e-mail was sent to the spokespersons in the various political parties but it was blocked because the word "condom" appeared in the e-mail.  Some lessons should be learned from that because in this case, that was a genuine e-mail.  It was a serious topic but because the word "condom" appeared in the e-mail it was blocked by the spam system.  The Leader might speak to the ICT unit to ensure that e-mails can come through the system.

The only way to approach the issue is to keep highlighting it.  I was surprised on reading the research to learn that children presenting themselves at school without having had a breakfast experience slow physical, intellectual and psychological growth.  As a result, they have very low self-esteem and a lack of confidence.  When we talk discuss child protection it is always in the context of legalistic matters and never ordinary everyday issues.  This has nothing to do with poverty but covers all sections of society, the rich, the poor and the middle classes.

Private issues explain the Minister's absence yesterday but I do not intend to put anything on the public record in that regard.

The Senator also mentioned the Taoiseach's speech on Saturday.  Sometimes, so as not to provoke controversy, we avoid gut politics in this House.  However, we think he made a fine speech and are entitled to say so.  He gave great credibility to the political system and it is outrageous that when we make definite promises, they are characterised as auction politics but when others do so, they are daring, innovative and wonderful.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Two studies, one by Senator Leyden and the other by Senator McHugh, will make interesting reading and I look forward to reading them.  Senator O'Toole raised a point with which I have great sympathy, namely, the cases piling up against the Department of Education and Science.  If what we read is correct, the Department seems determined to fight each one.  It has always been a tenet of Departments to fight such cases whenever and from wherever they arise, but many of the cases to which the Senator referred involve great heartbreak for parents and carers.  A more prudent approach may be required whereby the Department sifts through them to identify the genuine cases.  I take the Senator's point, especially as it relates to cases involving autism.Senator Ryan spoke about the creation of a snobs charter in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007 whereby developmental areas are to be exempted from Part V.

It is difficult not to agree with her and we must find a solution.  We will try to locate the Minister to provide an answer.Senator Coghlan referred to the joint committee's report on the BMW region.  He also asked about the Electoral Act and the litir um thoghchán.  I am of the belief that nobody reads the litir um thoghchán.

He also asked about An Post and said that 72% of letters posted today will reach their destination the next day but the remainder not until the following day.  He called for a debate on An Post and I agree, because it is approaching full liberalisation.Senator Norris asked about affordable homes and the exclusion of people from certain areas, which he called apartheid.  He also spoke of mental disability and I too have received a disturbing letter explaining that a person's disability allowance is to be sent to the residential facility.Senator Kitt raised the quality of water in Galway, as he did the other day.  Senator Bradford brought up the EU's concerns over the VHI and called for a debate.  When the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was in the House for the rushed debate on health insurance, she said there needed to be further legislation, and that seems to be confirmed by the latest developments.Senator Mansergh spoke about dangers in the water supply and we are pleased that the road from Kinnegad to Kilbeggan will be open from the end of April, just at a nice time.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Senator Henry suggested flood waters may affect the water supply.  She also spoke about the lack of educational psychological services in schools.  She said the school principal regarded the young woman who was recently murdered as a disruptive child who needed special help, which she did not receive.  We will have to have a debate on that matter.  I understand not enough educational psychologists come through the system annually.I agree with Senator Dooley that we should have a debate on housing.  The impulse behind the affordable housing scheme is commendable but it must be brought up to date in terms of money.  That is what is wrong with it.  Senator McHugh said that investing in infrastructure in the west will ease the difficulties of the east.  We have his report for consultation.  Senator Glynn supported Senator Norris with regard to the letter about disability payments to mental health patients.Senator Quinn referred to the Trinity report.  I found the report's conclusions difficult to understand.  The report dealt mainly with people from middle class homes and found that young people were being sent to school without having any breakfast.  That is clearly an issue of parenting, not means.  It is extremely odd that parents would not give food to their children.  I cannot understand it.  I wonder about the research.  I would like to read the report and examine the basis for it.  If the families are well off, there is no need for the State to intervene because they can afford to feed their children.  The Senator, however, made the point that the family that eats together stays together.  It would be better off for doing so.  The Senator also mentioned the road network in France, where the lines at the sides of the road are clearly marked.Senator Jim Walsh asked for a debate on the joint committee on justice report, which is currently with the Government.  He also raised the kamikaze attitude, as he described it, of certain nursing staff towards the new maternity hospital in Cork and sought a debate on partnership in that context.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Senator Ulick Burke has proposed that the House suspend to allow the Minister for Education and Science to come to the Seanad to clarify the fall-out from the Louise O'Keeffe case and to discuss the boards of management, which are due to be renewed next month.  His proposal was seconded by Senator Browne.  Senator Ulick Burke also raised the water problem in Galway and asked that it be rectified.Senator Scanlan sought a debate on affordable housing.  We should have a debate on housing in general and affordable housing in particular.  The income thresholds must be updated.  Senator Browne expressed his concern that the victims of sexual abuse do not know when they will get their opportunity to tell what happened to them.  He also praised the local radio stations' response to the car crash yesterday.  There were comments on that incident yesterday in the House.  The Senator should probably get in touch with the IT department to discuss how the spam issue is being dealt with.Senator Feeney also raised the issue of children going to school hungry.  It is well known that one cannot perform if one does not eat, regardless of one's age.  I cannot understand middle class families allowing children to go to school hungry.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Finance Bill contains the legislative proposals to implement the tax changes which I announced in the budget last December.  It also contains a range of other tax measures which will contribute significantly to underpinning growth in key sectors of the economy.The measures in the Bill reflect the continued commitment of the Government to the effective and fair management of the taxation system to ensure that the benefits of our strong economic growth are enjoyed by all taxpayers, especially low and middle income earners.  The Bill delivers significant improvements in the area of tax credits, allowances and bands and also cuts the top rate of income tax by 1%.  We are now in the position where 846,000 people will be outside the tax net in 2007 compared with 677,000 in 2004 and just 380,000 in 1997.  The tax burden for those on average incomes is less than half that of 1997 and we have one of the lowest tax takes in the world from those on low and middle incomes.  It is important to appreciate these facts and to acknowledge this perspective when setting out the contents of the Bill, as I will now do.This year's Finance Bill proposes to give effect to the announcements in the budget by increasing the personal and PAYE credits to ensure that those on the minimum wage will stay out of the tax net in 2007.  It reduces the top rate of income tax to 41%.  It increases the personal credits and bands to ensure that at least 80% of income earners will pay less than 20% of their income in income taxes in 2007.  It doubles the ceiling on which first-time house buyers can claim mortgage interest relief.  It introduces business-friendly measures aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises, including revised preliminary tax payment arrangements for corporation tax; increased VAT registration thresholds; enhancement of the tax credit scheme for research and development expenditure; and the renewal of the business expansion and seed capital schemes.The Bill also proposes to give effect to the announcement in the budget abolishing VAT on conference related accommodation expenses to allow Irish hotels to compete more favourably on the global stage for conference business.  It helps taxpayers claim certain key tax reliefs to which they are entitled by way of automatic repayments.  It will also improve or extend various tax reliefs for farmers.  In addition to the measures announced in budget 2007, this Bill proposes to introduce new tax arrangements for stallion stud fees with effect from 1 August 2008.  It will establish a tax incentive scheme to develop tourism infrastructure in the mid-Shannon area, expand the patent income relief scheme, close a number of avoidance loopholes in different areas, abolish the minimum thresholds of €125 and €250 to allow tax relief to be claimed in respect of all qualifying health expenses, extend the scheme of capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of qualifying residential units in registered nursing homes and exempt privately provided homecare services from VAT.The Bill runs to 130 sections and four schedules.  Today, I will outline some of the main provisions in the time available to me.  I will listen carefully to the contributions of Senators and try to respond to the points they make when I come to reply to the debate.The income tax measures and reliefs announced in the budget are dealt with in sections 2 to 4.  These widen the tax bands and increase various credits, including the basic personal credit and employee tax credit, and reduce the top rate by 1%.  When this Bill has been enacted, almost two out of every five income earners will have been removed from the tax net.  The Bill delivers on our promise to middle income earners to ensure that 80% of all taxpayers in effect pay tax at no more than the standard rate.Section 5 provides for a 9% increase in rent relief for individuals for rent paid for private rented accommodation which is their sole or main residence.  Section 6 confirms the budget increases in the ceilings on mortgage interest relief.  For first time buyers, the ceiling is doubled from €4,000 to €8,000 in the case of a single person and from €8,000 to €16,000 in the case of a married couple or a widowed person.  Smaller increases for non-first time buyers are also provided for.Section 9 will allow Revenue to credit and repay automatically reliefs to taxpayers such as age related tax credits, health expenses, tuition fees and trade union subscriptions.  It also abolishes the existing minimum thresholds of €125 and €250 for claims in respect of health expenses.Section 10 extends indefinitely the special tax exemption for unemployment benefit paid to systematic short-time workers.  This previously had been renewed from year to year.  Section 11 amends the provisions exempting from income tax income arising on the investment of certain compensation payments. This will exempt from tax returns from offshore funds in the same way as returns on domestic investments.Section 12 exempts from tax the travel and subsistence expenses paid to certain members of non-commercial bodies in both the public and private sectors in respect of the attendance at meetings of such bodies. Section 14 closes off an abuse of the rent-a-room exemption scheme so that the exemption will not apply where an adult child pays the rent to a parent for staying in the parental home. Section 15 increases the childminding tax exemption limit of €10,000 per annum set in last year's budget to a new level of €15,000 per annum in order to encourage a greater uptake.Section 16 introduces an additional threshold of relief of €20,000 per annum for qualifying long-term leases of farmland exceeding ten years duration. Section 17 amends the tax treatment of various pension products and approved retirement funds in a number of respects.  The main changes are that Revenue will in future be able to approve, subject to conditions, generic pension products such as those under which single member retirement benefits are marketed without the need for individual Revenue approval for each case.  An amendment to the legislation is being made to clarify that the operation of the pension fund limits is not affected as a consequence of pension adjustment orders made by the courts in circumstances of judicial separation or divorce.Section 18 amends the provisions introduced in Finance Act 2006 to limit the use of certain tax reliefs, including certain exemptions, by some high-income individuals to ensure the restriction operates as intended.  Section 19 confirms changes to the business expansion and seed capital schemes.  Both schemes are being extended for a further seven years until 31 December 2013.  The company limit is being increased from €1 million to €2 million, subject to a maximum of €1.5 million to be raised in a 12-month period.  The investor limit is being increased from €31,750 to €150,000 in the case of the business expansion scheme and to €100,000 in the case of the seed capital scheme.  These changes are subject to a commencement order being made on foot of approval by the European Commission.Section 20 proposes a number of changes to income tax appeal provisions to provide that where a determination of the Appeal Commissioners is to be reheard by a Circuit Court judge or a case is to be stated for the opinion of the High Court, the inspector will not be obliged to amend the assessment under appeal until the appeal process has been fully completed.  In such a case, a refund of tax paid or the collection of tax levied will not proceed until final judgment.Section 21 increases from €23,000 to €24,000 the value threshold for business cars.  The new threshold will apply to capital allowances and leasing charges for new and second-hand cars used in the course of a trade, profession or employment.Sections 22 to 25 amend the tax code in respect of farmers.  Certain farmers who were in receipt of FEOGA and single farm payments in the calendar year 2005 can qualify under the income averaging scheme.  It also introduces a scheme for the taxation of EU restructuring aid for sugar beet growers, which will allow those in receipt of the restructuring payments to average them over a period of six years for the purposes of calculating taxable income.  The 25% stock relief for farmers and the special incentive stock relief of 100% for certain young trained farmers is extended for a further two years, subject to clearance with the European Commission under state aid rules.  The educational qualifications for the special 100% relief are being aligned with the rules governing the stamp duty relief for young trained farmers.  The scheme of capital allowances for milk quota is being amended to ensure this relief is available for quota purchased under the new milk quota trading system.Section 26 sets out new tax arrangements for stallion stud fees which will come into effect on 1 August 2008, with the present regime ending from 31 July 2008.  The key measure in this new arrangement is the provision of a deduction for the purchase cost of the stallion which will allow the cost to be written off over a useful economic life of four years — the same broad principles as applies for other businesses. These tax arrangements are subject to clearance by the European Commission.Section 27 amends the tax relief for donations to approved bodies to remove a number of references to the requirement that various educational bodies must be established in the State.  Section 28 extends to 2010, subject to certain additional conditions, the scheme of capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of qualifying residential units associated with registered nursing homes, which was introduced in 2002 and is due to expire on 31 July 2008.Section 29 introduces a pilot scheme aimed at encouraging the development of tourism infrastructure in the mid-Shannon area, that is, 12 km either side of the river stretching from roughly the bottom of Lough Derg to Lough Ree.  The tax relief will consist of accelerated capital allowances over seven years for qualifying construction and refurbishment expenditure incurred in the qualifying three-year period.Section 30 relates to tax avoidance as regards unallocated partnership profits and clarifies the position that the tax-adjusted profits of a partnership, for tax purposes, must be fully apportioned between the individual partners each year.  This will close off a potentially large tax loss in some major partnership firms.Section 31 makes various amendments to relevant contract tax which applies to payments made by principal contractors to subcontractors under relevant contracts in the construction, meat processing and forestry industries aimed at reinforcing tax compliance in these areas. Sections 32 and 33 amend the current tax laws in relation to special savings incentive accounts and the pensions incentive tax credits scheme to empower  Revenue to seek various information returns from SSIA managers and to require SSIA moneys invested in pension funds under the pensions incentive tax credits scheme to be held for at least one year in order to avoid a clawback of credits given under the scheme.Section 34 provides for DIRT-free interest to be paid automatically by financial institutions to taxpayers of 65 years of age or over whose total income does not exceed the relevant income tax exemption limit.  This will also apply to permanently incapacitated people in receipt of such interest in defined circumstances.Section 35 changes the procedures that apply to give the force of Irish law to double taxation treaties.  In future, such a treaty will have the force of law only after the Government has made an Order that has been approved by the Dáil and law has been enacted by the Oireachtas that inserts a reference to the Order into a new schedule that is being inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section secures the position of existing double taxation agreements in Irish law by listing them in the new Schedule 24A.In section 36, I am seeking to afford relief to persons who may suffer double taxation arising from capital gains in countries with which we have a double taxation treaty, but where the treaty itself predates the introduction of capital gains tax in Ireland.  The section also removes an element of double taxation on the profits of a foreign branch or agency of an Irish company, where such a branch or agency is located in a country with which we do not have a double taxation treaty.Section 37 removes an anomaly in the tax deductibility of share-based consideration given by a company to employees.  Section 38 provides for a number of amendments to the scheme of dividend withholding tax, DWT, to deal with the introduction of electronic dividend vouchers, theapplication of the general four-year time limit that applies to other tax repayments to refunds of DWT, and an extension of the existing exemption from DWT available to non-resident subsidiaries.Section 39 amends the taxation rules on offshore funds that are created under the law of EU and EEA member states and certain OECD countries.  These funds are covered by the gross roll-up taxation regime introduced in the Finance Act 2001.Section 40 is an anti-avoidance provision which makes a number of changes to provide special rules for the taxation of personal portfolio investment undertakings concerning payments made to unit holders.  This will prevent the exploitation by some wealthy individuals of the lower exit tax rate on certain investment funds.Section 41 provides that the national pensions reserve fund and securitisation companies may receive payments from investment undertakings without the imposition of an exit tax under the gross roll-up regime.  Sections 42 and 43 amend taxation procedures on life insurance policies so that the investment proceeds of all life insurance policies will become chargeable to income tax after an eight-year period.Section 44 strengthens certain anti-avoidance provisions on the transfer of assets abroad.  Section 45 amends the scheme of relief for patent income to provide an annual monetary cap of €5 million with effect from 1 January 2008.  The restriction in the definition of "qualifying patent" relating to research and other activities only being carried out "in the State", is also being removed to allow for such qualifying activities to be carried out elsewhere in the European Economic Area.Section 46 extends the application for a further three years, to 2009, of the base year 2003 expenditure on research and development against which incremental expenditure will be measured for the purpose of the R&D tax credit.  In addition, expenditure by companies on sub-contracting R&D work to unconnected parties will qualify under the tax credit scheme up to a limit of 10% of qualifying R&D expenditure in any one year.Section 47 confirms the budget day announcement that the preliminary corporation tax liability threshold for treatment as a small company is being increased from €50,000 to €150,000.  New or start-up companies with a corporation tax liability of €150,000 or less for their first accounting period will not be required to pay preliminary tax in respect of that first accounting period.  In addition, provisions are being introduced under which large companies in a group will be allowed to offset their preliminary tax payments between group members for the purpose of working out the adequacy of such payments for interest purposes.  This will assist in minimising interest charges on the group.Section 48 deals with group relief for companies, the provisions for which are being amended mainly to comply with a ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Marks & Spencer case on the use of foreign tax losses.  Section 49 makes two technical amendments to a measure introduced in the Finance Act 2006 that allowed a company with a foreign currency asset to match that asset for tax purposes with redeemable share capital denominated in the same currency.  These amendments will ensure that this legislation operates as intended.Section 50 introduces a measure that provides an option to companies not to have interest payments made to associated companies, in countries with which we do not have a double taxation agreement, deemed as a distribution of their profits.  This removes an element of double taxation in the tax code.Section 51 extends the qualifying period for the scheme of tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011, subject to clearance by the European Commission from a State aid perspective.Sections 52 to 56 amend the tax code on capital gains tax in a number of ways.  Retirement relief is being amended, first, by increasing the consideration threshold from €500,000 to €750,000; second, by allowing the relief in certain circumstances where land is leased prior to disposal; third, by extending the limitless relief to a child of a deceased  child of the disponer; and fourth, by extending the relief to certain intra-family transfers of farmland.  The site to child relief is being amended to limit the size of the site to one acre, exclusive of the house.  A technical change is being made to the exemption for sports bodies to ensure that the full value of the existing asset must be applied for approved purposes.  There is a technical amendment in the offshore income gains provisions to update a reference to resident individuals.  Finally, where a capital gains tax clearance is not produced on the closing of a sale, an amendment will ensure that any consideration withheld must be paid to the Revenue Commissioners within 30 days.Parts 2 and 3 deal with indirect taxes, that is, excise and VAT.  These include sections 57 to 74, inclusive, which set out a range of changes in regard to excise duties, including confirming the budget day reduction to zero of excise duty on kerosene and LPG used for heating, the increase in excise on tobacco, and the introduction of a VRT relief of 50% for electric cars.  Mineral oil tax offences are being strengthened, for example, in respect of selling laundered diesel.  Existing provisions on substitute fuels are being amended so that such fuels, including biofuels, will in future be taxed at the rate applicable to the fuel for which they can be substituted.  The definition of "mechanically propelled vehicle" is amended to exclude vehicles that do not meet EU type approval standards for entry into service on the State's roads.  Arising from the Criminal Justice Act 2006, excise duties are being adjusted or imposed concerning firearms.In response to rulings by the European Court of Justice relating to other member states, the Bill provides that company cars driven by Irish residents on behalf of firms based outside Ireland, will be exempt from VRT subject to certain conditions.  Provision is also being made for the late opening of betting shops on days on which an evening race meeting is taking place in Ireland, regardless of the time of year.  Currently, late opening is allowable when daylight hours facilitate evening race meetings, that is, April through to August.  This change is in response to the advent of floodlit night-time horse racing in Ireland from the latter half of the year.Sections 75 to 98, inclusive, contain a number of important revisions to the VAT code.  They confirm budget increases to the VAT registration thresholds for small businesses from €27,500 to €35,000 in the case of services and from €55,000 to €70,000 in the case of goods with effect from 1 March 2007; the increase in the threshold for the cash basis of accounting for VAT from €635,000 to €1,000,000 effective from 1 March 2007; the increase in the farmers' flat-rate VAT addition from 4.8% to 5.2% with effect from 1 January 2007; and the reduction of the VAT rate on child car-seats from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 May 2007.Section 78 provides for the removal of the option for landlords to waive their right to exemption from VAT on short-term letting of residential property to remove an anomaly whereby the landlord can claim VAT on the assets of the property in year one, but the equivalent VAT on rents from the property will only be received by the Exchequer over a prolonged period.  This currently acts as an unintended Exchequer subsidy to private letting.Sections 83 and 89 provide for the deducibility of VAT on conference-related accommodation expenses from 1 July 2007 to help Irish hotels to compete more favourably for international conference business.  Section 93 provides for the exemption of privately provided homecare services from VAT.  Other VAT changes relate to hire purchase transactions in cases where the customer defaults on repayments and where finance houses are involved in the transactions, the taxation of certain services received by public bodies — for example, consultancy services from abroad — and the application of the open market value to certain transactions between connected parties in determining the amount on which VAT is chargeable.Sections 99 to 111 introduce changes to the stamp duty code in order to abolish the head of charge for mortgages and other minor heads of charge, thereby simplifying the stamp duty code; amend and update the educational criteria and repayment procedure of the young trained farmer relief; and introduce a new relief for farm consolidation which allows a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where the farmer sells and purchases farmland within 18 months of each other, in order to consolidate his or her holding.  The introduction of this relief is dependent of State aid approval.These changes to the stamp duty code will also introduce a new exemption from stamp duty for sporting bodies, which are already entitled to relief from income tax and capital gains tax, where they purchase land for the purposes of promoting games or sports; limit the transfer of a site from a parent to a child to build a house to one acre, exclusive of the house; provide for an exemption from stamp duty on certain intra-family transfers of farmland; update and facilitate the provision whereby persons who have undergone a judicial separation/divorce/nullity can claim first-time buyer relief; introduce a new relief for stock market intermediaries to better reflect modern share dealing practices; and introduce a new provision whereby certain transactions involving land would become subject to stamp duty outside of conveyance.  This amendment is the subject of a commencement order.Regarding capital acquisitions tax, sections 113 and 114 are technical amendments which arise as a result of a High Court case decided last year relating to when a discretionary trust created will come into existence.  The tax will now apply from the date of appointment to the trust instead of the date of death as before.Section 115 alters the date from which interest becomes payable in the context of a clawback of agricultural or business relief where the assets are sold within the specified period.  The interest will now apply from the date the clawback arises.Section 116 amends the dwelling house relief to provide that any period during which a beneficiary of a gift occupied a house that was during that period the disponer's only or main residence will not be treated as a period of occupation prior to the date of the gift unless the disponer is compelled, by reason of old age or infirmity, to depend on the services of the beneficiary for that period.  It also ensures that the house, or any house which has replaced that house, must be owned by the disponer for the relevant three year period prior to the date of the gift.  Section 117 deals with CAT agricultural relief and amends existing provisions so that an individual may off-set borrowings on an off-farm principal private residence against the property's value, for the purpose of the 80% farmer test.  Section 118 provides that a clearance certificate will no longer be required for contracts dated on or after 1 February 2007 or for contracts dated before 1 February 2007 where the sale is to be completed on or after 1 February 2007.Regarding tax administration, section 121 provides for a reduction from 6 months or 183 days to 93 days in the period which must elapse, after the receipt of a valid claim, before Revenue is required to pay interest on overpayments.  Section 122 provides for a once-off increase in 2007 in the ceiling for donations to the Irish Heritage Trust from €6 million to €10 million to allow for the donation of a collection of fine Irish paintings and furniture for display in Fota House.Section 123 amends the existing return requirements for Departments, the Health Service Executive, local authorities and similar statutory bodies regarding rent or rent subsidy so that these bodies are required to obtain the personal public service number, PPSN, of the landlord concerned.  Section 124 amends the tax law to clarify and confirm the search powers of Revenue to assist in investigations with a view to prosecutions.  Section 125 provides for the Crawford Art Gallery Cork Limited to be included in the list of approved bodies eligible to receive donations and Section 126 creates a new offence of impersonating a Revenue officer.This Finance Bill, in conjunction with changes announced in the budget, demonstrates the continued commitment of the Government to pursue modern tax policies in a way that promotes economic growth, rewards work and alleviates the burden on taxpayers, especially those on lower pay.  The reform of the tax structure over the last ten years has been a major driver of our economic success.  The approach of keeping personal and business taxes low has served to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.The Central Statistics Office is publishing the fourth quarter and full year national accounts for 2006.  These are preliminary figures but today's data shows that gross domestic product rose by 6% last year with a corresponding increase of 7.4% in gross national product.  This is the strongest rate of growth since 2000, before the information technology related slowdown.  These figures confirm that the economy is continuing to perform well and they exceed those expected by most commentators, including the Department of Finance.There was an improvement in our export performance last year, mainly due to higher services exports.  The performance of manufacturing exports remains more modest and highlights the need for ongoing improvements in our cost competitiveness.  In terms of this year, my Department is forecasting a continuation of strong economic growth, with GDP and GNP both expected to rise by 5.3%.  While the outlook is favourable we must, as a small, open economy, be cognisant of the risks to the global economic environment, such as the potential for sharp movements in the euro-dollar exchange rate.  These risks highlight the need to remain competitive as well as the need for prudent management of public finances to provide room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties arising.Ireland's overall economic and budgetary position is now the envy of Europe.  Our national debt is among the lowest in Europe, we are running a healthy budget surplus which we intend to continue if re-elected, our economy is strong and unemployment is low.  Everything must be predicated on keeping our economy strong.  As Minister for Finance, I have a responsibility to secure and build on the progress which has been made.This Bill is solidly grounded on the financial and economic policies which have delivered unprecedented prosperity for our people.  I hope this outline of its provisions will facilitate an informed and constructive debate in this House.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad and I look forward to the debate.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the Bill which contained some information of which I was not aware.  I did not realise that it was not an offence to impersonate a Revenue officer; many people may regard it as an offence to be a Revenue officer.  Nor did I realise that there would be floodlit racing by the end of the year, as the Minister mentioned, and many people will welcome this provision.I agree with much of what the Minister has said and as contained in the budget, particularly regarding the measures in the area of preliminary taxation on small businesses, the seed capital scheme and the business expansion scheme.  He has made many announcements that should be welcomed including the new tourism scheme for the midlands.  It is important that when new schemes are announced and existing schemes extended we be presented with an analysis of the costs involved and the benefit that will accrue to the taxpayer and the nation.  My colleague in the other House, Deputy Bruton, also emphasised this.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not take the opportunity to do this but he may in his closing remarks.I welcome many aspects of this Finance Bill but, as with recent Finance Bills, I feel that, overall, it is a disappointing legislation and represents a missed opportunity.  I do not detect from the Bill, the Minister's comments or the Government in general enough reforming zeal in terms of restructuring the tax system and how taxpayers' money is spent.  If we do not do this now in a time of plenty, if the Minister does not do this in a Finance Bill such as this, it will be far more difficult when the economy is not as strong as it is now.  A number of economic indicators suggest there is reason for concern about the future.The International Monetary Fund pointed out last year that there is an over reliance in the economy on the construction sector, though we did not need the IMF to tell us this.  Many people would argue, with some merit, that much of our economic growth, particularly in the past four or five years, is based on the construction industry and private debt, which has grown hugely in recent years.  These foundations are not strong for the ongoing prosperity of our country and economy.  The failure of the Minister and Government to vigorously reform the way we spend our money and use this opportunity and time of plenty to create reforms is disappointing to say the least.  The Minister referred to some of the areas that concern me in his comments and did not refer to others.I have said before that I believe the major legacy of the past ten years of this Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government is the disaster that is our housing sector.  Many young people are struggling to get mortgages and keep a roof over their heads.  Houses have gone from affordable ten years ago to unaffordable today, even to people with very good jobs.  I am disappointed by the Minister's refusal to accept the point made from within the Government and the Opposition that reform of stamp duty is essential.  The stamp duty system is one of the more complex elements of the taxation system.  In fairness to the Minister he has undertaken efforts to simplify the taxation system.  There is ample scope for reforming stamp duty on residential property, with its many rates and thresholds.I do not accept the Minister's argument that exempting first-time buyers from paying stamp duty on house purchases would distort the property market.  First-time buyers make up a small proportion of house purchasers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I have never made such an assertion.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	160	It has been asserted in this House that reforming the system to exempt first-time buyers from paying stamp duty would distort the market and increase prices because developers would pass on any reduction in stamp duty to the purchaser.  I do not accept this argument.  Figures show that of approximately €1 billion collected in stamp duty on residential property, only €50 million was paid by first-time buyers.  This is a small proportion of the larger figure.  A strong case can be made for reforming stamp duty with particular emphasis on first-time buyers.  I am disappointed the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to address the issue in this Bill and previous Finance Bills.The Minister referred briefly to the environment.  The Government had adopted a short-term policy of purchasing carbon credits to offset our increases in our emissions allowance under the Kyoto Agreement.  It has not developed a long-term strategy for meeting our commitments under the agreement without having to resort to buying credits.  The next Government must examine this issue as a matter of urgency.As I have frequently stated, in recent years a myth has developed that Ireland is a low tax economy.  While taxes on income have been significantly reduced and further reductions in income tax in the budget are welcome, we do not live in a low tax economy.  In 2005 or 2006, the Government, for the first time in the history of the State, presided over circumstances in which people paid more in indirect taxation than direct taxation.  Indirect taxation is regressive because those on low incomes spend a much higher proportion of income on it than those on higher incomes.Another legacy of the Government has been a continuous barrage of stealth taxes and charges.  The increase in VAT introduced in the budget immediately after the previous general election has not been rescinded.  The Minister could do a serious job in the area of indirect taxation.  I look forward to the next Minister of Finance tackling the issue.The Minister referred to effective tax rates, about which we have heard a great deal in recent months.  The programme for Government between the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties featured a commitment that 80% of employees would pay tax at the lower rate.  The term "effective tax rate", which has crept into the debate, was not mentioned when the commitment was given in the parties' manifestos and the programme for Government.One of my principal concerns in the area of taxation is the repeated underestimation of Exchequer tax receipts in the past three or four years.  I do not know who is at fault or how this failure can be explained.  Last year, tax receipts exceeded expectations by €4 billion.  I am anxious to learn how the Minister proposes to ensure expectations of annual tax revenues become more realistic.  Are the figures deliberately massaged for political purposes to give an impression during the subsequent budget debate that the economy is in a stronger than expected position and the Minister for Finance can divvy out more money?I and many other Senators have expressed concern about inflation.  While the most recent monthly figure indicated a marginal decrease in the inflation rate, most observers agree that the rate will rise again in the coming months.  It is worrying that our rate of between 4.5% and 5% is significantly higher than those of most of our European competitors.  The Government made no perceptible effort in the Bill or budget to reduce the inflation rate.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's comments on the issue.In the past two or three years, Ireland has become the second or third most expensive country in the European Union.  If we are serious about maintaining economic competitiveness, we must keep our costs low and inflation rate down.The Minister made a number of positive announcements on agriculture in the Budget Statement and Finance Bill.  In order to firmly establish the biofuels sector and provide a viable alternative for agriculture and environmental benefits, excise duty on domestically produced biofuel most be completely removed.  The Government must introduce such a measure as a matter of urgency.As I have argued previously, the Government must introduce roll-over relief for capital gains tax, having reversed its decision to introduce such a relief immediately after the previous general election.  I will outline again the case of man in my area who will lose ten acres of land because the new Dublin to Waterford route traverses his property.  As an unwilling seller, it would be fair to exempt this man from capital gains tax and afford him an opportunity, within 12 months of having received compensation, to spend the money on buying replacement land.  To do otherwise and impose capital gains tax of 20% would effectively allow the State to take two of the ten acres.Many people do not understand how roll-over relief operates.  A strong case can be made for providing this type of relief to persons such as the farmer to whom I have referred, who are required to give up land as a public service but wish to remain in agriculture.  Such persons should be allowed to spend the compensation they receive in lieu of having land purchased to make way for a road without having to pay capital gains tax.  I urge the Minister to introduce roll-over relief in this area.I had hoped to discuss the topical and important issue of education and class sizes.  The Taoiseach spoke for 23 minutes at his party's Ard-Fheis.  Listening to his speech on my way home from mass on Sunday, I nearly crashed my car when he said he wanted to fire 4,000 teachers, before correcting himself and using the word "hire".  He outlined planned expenditure amounting to approximately €6.9 billion, most of which consisted of rehashed and reheated promises from the previous general election campaign.  Perhaps the Fianna Fáil Party's new green image on the environment has been earned from its tendency to recycle political promises.I have serious concerns about competitiveness and inflation when I hear the Taoiseach talk about splashing such large sums of money around after the next general election.  It is a matter of political priority as to which areas need investment.  I look forward to being in a position following the general election, when Fine Gael is in government, to ensure we provide that political priority.

I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his three-year stewardship of the national economy and national finances.  As I said in a previous debate, he was adjudged by the Financial Times to be the best Minister for Finance in the euro zone.The budget has resulted in a situation where 38% of taxpayers no longer pay tax because their incomes are low or low to middle.  I have noticed an interesting element entering public debate, namely, this situation is now criticised as being too generous to the low paid.  Chambers Ireland and the economics editor of The Irish Times have both made this criticism, with which I do not agree as it is a situation of which we can be proud.For comparative purposes, I considered the budget produced by Gordon Brown last week.  A married couple with two children in the United Kingdom, with one of the couple employed and earning £20,000, which is approximately €30,000, will pay approximately £3,000 or €4,500 under the British budget.  Here, a person on €30,000, virtually the exact equivalent, will pay €858, according to the Minister's budget tables, or approximately one fifth of what is paid in Britain.  The idea that this is not a low-tax economy is simply not true.Perhaps this is the way "new Labour" in Ireland would operate if it was in government.   What Gordon Brown was doing was taking with one hand and giving with the other.

The cut of 2% in corporation tax which, according to the Financial Times was partly stimulated by competition from Ireland even though Mr. Brown likes to talk only about the big seven economies, was paid for by small businesses which saw their introductory rate of corporation tax increase.We do not fully appreciate what an incredibly fortunate situation we are in.  When the Opposition refers to stealth taxes it must include, for example, a 3% rise in public transport fares, which is a complete devaluation of the term.

Let us study it before we call it nonsense.  The stamp duty issue is irrelevant to large tracts of the country.  I visited an estate agent in Tipperary, where the average price for a good detached three-bedroom house is approximately €220,000, well below the stamp duty threshold.  Moreover, somebody must be buying the 93,000 houses that were built last year.What many ignore with regard to stamp duty is the fact that this country does not have a property tax.  I heard an auctioneer argue on "Morning Ireland" that the onus fell on the seller, particularly at the higher range.  People of my generation have seen astronomical increases in the value of property.  Some of the media campaigns have not been motivated by concern for first-time buyers but by people sitting on properties worth at least €1 million, who want the market to continue ever onwards and upwards.One of the problems the Minister faces is that he is under pressure in every budget to increase the excise duty on cigarettes which, unfortunately, has a major impact on inflation.  I recommend that he would in future pick from the indirect tax area some countervailing reductions which would neutralise the cost of living impact, if he cannot get agreement from the social partners to eliminate this.In contrast with the position across the water, small businesses will have good reason to be pleased with the budget and the Finance Bill.  If I understand correctly what I read, the bizarre challenge by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the raising of the BES thresholds has been dismissed by the European Commission.There is great interest in tax incentives for renewable energy.  Several points have been made to me in this regard, one by a person in the forestry sector, namely, that we have a potential renewable energy resource in the thinnings from woodlands.  It is important that these thinnings be used and not just encourage products such as willow and miscanthus.Many businesses are interested in getting into biofuels.  There is a danger that much of this material might be imported but there is also a potential for it to be grown here, particularly in the absence of the sugar beet industry.  The point has been made to me that while many grants have already been awarded, excise duty is the crucial factor.

For example, hurleys are manufactured in this country.  The point was made to me that if the VAT rate was 13.5% rather than 21%, it would help to eliminate the black market.

The positive way of considering this issue is to acknowledge that for 40 years a fantastic incentive has been in place which has moved the industry in Ireland from what was a very middling position in the 1950s and 1960s to one where, while we use the term too often, we genuinely are world class.  I commend the Minister and his officials, first, for giving adequate notice of the change of regime and, second, for working out a viable regime which will help the industry to maintain its lead position in the world.  Unlike some, although I do not live in the Shannon area, I commend the Minister on his incentives for the region as it is a potentially important area.  I am also glad to see him make special provisions in the heritage area for Cork.  It is right to be explicit about the beneficiaries of these provisions.  The extension of the childminders' tax exemption is pragmatic and sensible.  In light of experience, the original exemption of €10,000 has been adjusted to €15,000 for this badly needed service.  I approve of the tapering out of various construction provisions, but feel the incentive for sheltered housing for the elderly is worth keeping.Underestimation can be put down to the caution of the Department of Finance.  I do not believe the Minister uses the red pencil on Revenue projections or adjusts them downwards at the beginning of the year.  Neither he nor his predecessors would do that.  There may be a subliminal element of the Department of Finance trying to keep the rest of the country under control, especially in buoyant conditions, but I would not criticise the Minister for that.I was amused by the inclusion of the offence of impersonating a Revenue official.  When I was very young I played an April fool's joke — this was at the time of the wealth tax — and sent my uncle a letter purporting to come from a Revenue official, which mentioned getting all his property ready for inspection and assessment in successive slices.  I am sure he was not amused.  If this provision had been available, he might have been tempted to make use of it.

I do not claim this success has been achieved by one party.  It has been achieved by partnership and different coalitions of partners.  The 1987-1989 Fine Gael Tallaght strategy arrangements contributed to it as well.We are far ahead of where any of us thought we would be.  We have doubled employment, moved from an acute debt problem to a situation where we have one of the lowest debts in the eurozone and from a situation of heavy taxes to a low tax regime.  Although none of us believed it would be possible, we are now a relatively lightly taxed country.  The main difference from where we were in the 1940s and 1950s is that we now have proper social services and proper infrastructure.  Yesterday, I was delayed on my route to Dublin and had to take the old roads through Kildare and Newbridge because of the tragic accident on the N7.  Those old roads are a reminder of the way things were.  Today, we are able to finance, almost wholly out of our own resources, infrastructure needs and much of the aid provided to our farmers.I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and on his management of the economy.  As long as he is in charge, economic confidence is safe andsecure.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  When I come to look at a Bill, I often find it is better to look at the Minister's speech on it, especially the last few lines.  Towards the end of his speech on the Bill, the Minister said when referring to the national debt as among the lowest in Europe: "I have a responsibility to secure and build on the progress which has been made."  He also said we were running a healthy budget surplus, our economy was strong and unemployment was low.  I believe the economy is in good hands.  My only fear is that there may be a degree of complacency or cockiness, not necessarily in the Minister but in the country as a whole.  On that basis, I worry there is a danger there may be competition and so-called auctioneering in the area of the economy.The Minister said: "Ireland's overall economic and budgetary position is now the envy of Europe."  He is incorrect to confine it to Europe.  It is the envy of the world.  Yesterday, I received an invitation to visit Central America next month to speak about the Irish economy because somebody had heard me speak on the success of the Irish economy when I was in Brazil and Argentina in November.  I had to do some work to prepare for my speech in November and examined the cause of the success of our economy.  There were five main reasons for it: improved education since the 1960s, the identification of high-tech or sunrise industries, entry to the European Union, partnership and the decision to go for a low corporate tax to encourage investment in Ireland.  This has been very successful and we are the envy not just of Europe but of the rest of the world.I look at all legislation carefully, particularly Finance Bills, to ensure there is nothing in them that will damage our economy.  Looking at the Bill in this light, I support the Minister's proposals in general.  However, I would encourage him to concentrate on some areas, one of which was touched on by Senator Mansergh, namely, bio-fuels.  When I was in Brazil, I was interested to see every petrol station advertise not just petrol but also what they call alcol, which is ethanol.  Alcol is available in every petrol station there.  I have a daughter who wants to drive a bio-fuel car, but she has difficulty in doing so because of difficulty with the availability of bio-fuels.  I am not sure what the Minister can do to improve the situation and encourage the availability of bio-fuels in this country.  CIE and Bus Éireann use bio-fuels to a large extent, but it is not easily available.  I would like to see an improvement in this area.I would like to focus on a specific area of this long and complex Bill, namely, taxation or the effective discouragement of charitable donations.  For many years there were few wealthy people in Ireland and, therefore, taxation of charitable donations was not an area of contention.  In recent years, however, we have an increasing number of well-off people but we have not done enough to encourage them to reinvest in the country.  I was talking to somebody on the board of a university in this country who was trying to raise funds and finding difficulty in doing so.  This person visited one of the schools in Harvard which had raised $400 million in one year from successful and wealthy graduates, but the Irish university to which he was attached had only managed to raise €12,000 by similar means.There are opportunities now that did not previously exist.  The challenge did not exist previously because we did not have significant numbers of wealthy Irish people 20 years ago.  Now there are and they are generous and anxious to contribute to the economy that has helped them become wealthy.  They are anxious to create foundations or make generous contributions.  However, we have not recognised this.  Take, for example, the legislation introduced in 2006 to ensure high income earners pay tax.  The legislation introduced conditions which would ensure they would not get away without paying some tax.  However, the sweeping powers introduced by the Minister may have included some provisions that should not have been included. Legal advice I received on tax issues affecting charities states:A general cap on claims for certain tax allowances and reliefs by high-income individuals was introduced in the Finance Act, 2006 (now section 485C and Schedule 25B TCA 1997) with effect from 2007.  This unexpectedly included the s.848A donation scheme within its scope.  The restriction will operate by limiting the amount of relief available in respect of tax allowances and reliefs by the higher of 50% of the person's income before the reliefs or €250,000.  It is extremely surprising that the Department of Finance would categorise a donation to charity as subject to the restriction for tax reliefs in the same category as that of commercial allowances and reliefs (such as property, capital allowances schemes, patent royalties, film and BES reliefs and exempt distributions).The Minister introduced restrictions to ensure that the reliefs enabling those wealthy people to avoid paying tax included in that list donations to charity which are of no benefit to the donor.  That was probably an error.  I can understand how it slipped in but I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to changing that provision.Charities must be registered for two years to be eligible in this scheme.  This is understandable because people need to be able to check up on a charitable organisation to which they wish to donate.  When an event such as the tsunami occurs, however, it is  difficult to set up a scheme.  Will the Minister consider another way to overcome that problem?I am advised that "charitable donations should allow a credit against all taxes, not just income tax".  The 1997 scheme "allows donors of heritage property to the State to credit the value against any tax including income tax".  It might be possible to do something in that area.Another point made to me, and previously to the Minister, refers to value added tax, VAT, on charities.  For many years that was not in the Minister's hands because the European Commission did not permit the exclusion of charities.  The Commission changed its regulations approximately two years ago, to permit some exceptions to that ruling.  I met people from a charitable institution in Denmark who explained how they responded, which they did very quickly.  Their institution does not pay VAT on certain of their expenditures.  When one contributes to a charity some of the money will cover VAT on everything it spends.  In Denmark, however, when one contributes €100 the whole sum goes to the charity because it will not be spent on VAT.  The figures in Ireland would not be outrageously difficult for the Minister to handle but a scheme similar to that introduced in Denmark would be of great benefit.I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to the way Ireland persists in discriminating against foreign charities for taxation purposes.  It is in the public interest to encourage philanthropy to the maximum possible extent, so that at least some of the profits that the Celtic tiger has created are used for the benefit of mankind worldwide.  I acknowledge the existing tax concessions in regard to charitable donations, which are very right and proper, but which unfortunately apply only to charities established here in Ireland.No tax relief is allowable for any donations made to a charity that is not established in this country.  This reminds me of the time when we were setting up the George Mitchell Scholarships in honour of the American Senator who did so much to bring about the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  The scheme passed through the Dáil and came to this House where it was to pass quickly.  I noticed one line in it to the effect that the money intended to encourage American students to study in Ireland, although it was not limited to Americans, was to be spent in the State.  I suggested to the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin,  that this could not be right because if somebody was coming to study peace he or she should go North to do so.  The Minister, however, had advice from the Attorney General to say that was tricky and the money should be spent only in the State.  I put down an amendment to suggest that it should not be limited to the State, which the Minister accepted.  Thank God he did because many of those who have come to Ireland from the United States have the opportunity to study in the North which they could not do had that minor technical point remained.  They come every year and I have met several of them.

This point reflected what is at work today, a bureaucratic mindset that operates on the principle that the world begins and ends at the Irish border.  I would like to think that we are more broad-minded than that.In the matter of the George Mitchell Scholarships commonsense eventually prevailed, and the Bill was suitably amended in this House.  I am calling for the same kind of commonsense to be applied in this matter.  Charity may begin at home, but it does not end there and there is no logical reason to discriminate in our tax regime against foreign charities.  To do so reflects a blinkered and provincial thinking that does not sit well with the role we aspire to play in the world today.  I do not believe that the Minister or his officials intended to do this.  It happened by accident.  Will the Minister give serious attention to this point because there is wealth in Ireland and we do not want to spend it all in Ireland.  We want to help mankind in the rest of the world.I am not alone in thinking this.  The European Commission considers that this discrimination is contrary to the Treaty on the European Union, and it has already begun to take proceedings against Ireland in this matter.  Rather than fighting this unwinnable case to the bitter end, I suggest that the Minister bow to the inevitable and concede the matter now, by means of an amendment on Committee Stage.

Let us make sure we encourage them to do so not by limiting ourselves to the borders of Ireland, worthy as that is but to by enabling them to make changes in the whole world.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill today.  I recognise that the economic prosperity and success of the country is due to prudent management and initiatives made by successive Ministers for Finance, through the Finance Acts, and their management of the country.  We would not have this success or the ability to put money into social welfare, education and increased spending on health without the increased prosperity in the country.My concern today however is that these benefits have not been balanced.  Spending under the national development plan on roads and health outside what used to be termed "the Pale" in areas from Donegal down to Kerry is unbalanced.   For example, the forecast expenditure in the Border, midland and western, BMW, region to December 2006 was €15.2 billion.  I am not an economist and ask to be corrected if I am wrong in believing €1 billion is €100 million.

#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	183	That is better or worse, as the case may be — we just could not figure that out.  When we start to discuss figures in billions, this is perhaps one of the things that goes wrong.I will outline information given to me by the Department of Finance and I apologise if it is wrong.  The expenditure forecast for the BMW region in the period 2000 to December 2006 was €15.2 billion.  It was supposed to be €18.2 billion and there is therefore an underspend of €3 billion.  The per capita GDP data for 2004 indicate there is no balanced regional development.  The GDP for Dublin per capita was 33% higher than the Irish average and in the Border, midlands and west region, it was 25% below average.  The disposable income per person in 2004 in the BMW region was 6.8% below average.  There was €17.142 billion in disposable income in the BMW region compared to €50.921 billion in the south and east.The National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 recognises an imbalance between the regions in terms of national economic progress.  The new national development plan states there is no longer to be a BMW region or regional spending, and that spending will depend on potential, as measured by the ESRI.  What is the potential of Galway over Dublin, or of Clifden over parts of the east?  How will we define spending in the west, which is underdeveloped and has not been given all the money it was supposed to receive?  It was allocated but not spent?  What kind of strategy will measure potential?  According to the Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the changes proposed to the spending regime in the national development plan for the period 2007 to 2013 comprise a retrograde step.  I agree with it.The Minister is aware there is a water crisis in Galway.  Many are saying it is not a matter for national Government but for local authorities.  Are we living in a country in which national emergencies affecting 90,000 people are not addressed?  Kofi Annan has stated clean, safe water is a basic human right, as confirmed in UN documentation.  Ninety thousand households in Galway do not have this basic human right and it is not acceptable for Ministers and others to say it is not an issue for central Government but for local authorities, which have responsibility to clean up the mess.  If it took €60 million to clean up the mess in Galway, only €500 per person would be required.  I do not know if €60 million would suffice and am only using the figure for illustrative purposes but we should consider my point nevertheless.Is the Minister aware that there is no capital expenditure proposed for the paediatric unit in University College Hospital, Galway, until 2011?  The hospital cannot accommodate one child per room and does not have en suite toilet facilities for children or parents.  There are four-bed rooms in the children’s section of the hospital, in which little girls and boys may or may not be accompanied by a parent and have parental protection.  If one child in the hospital is accompanied by a parent while another is unaccompanied, what kind of safety is provided?  Children and parents are sharing toilets that were installed in the early 1950s or 1960s.  This does not suggest the existence of a centre of excellence or a super-regional hospital.  The Minister, when he entered Government in 1997, promised there would be cardiac surgery in the west.  We have a facility with six beds and two cardiothorastic surgeons——

It is not often that we have the Minister in the House.  My comments are completely related to the Finance Bill because the money comes from the Department of Finance.  I will try to make my comments more specific to the Bill.  They all concern how we are spending our money.  Expectant mothers must wait 20 weeks to have a scan in the hospital in Galway.  The Minister might say this is not his problem as it concerns the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, but it is.  The Government made promises to the people of Galway in the past two elections and has failed to deliver on them.  I was not elected, as the Minister knows, but I will not stand here and say this is good enough for Galway.The roll-out of BreastCheck has been raised on the Order of Business and we will be discussing it in the health debate in the coming days.  It was promised that it would be rolled out nationally in 2000.  In 2003, it was promised it would be available in Galway in 2005.  It will not be available until October or November of this year and this is not good enough.  I am not referring to roads as these comprise an entirely different story but we must make a stand, as I intend to do, and argue that the circumstances I have outlined are not acceptable for the west, including Galway.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate and I want to reply to some of the key points that have been made.  I disagree with Senator John Phelan that we have not reformed our tax spending.  The opposite is the case in that the tax burden has reduced considerably for all earners in the past ten years, directly as a result of the policies pursued by the Government.  Many more people are working than were working ten years ago and they are paying much less tax on what they earn.  Those on the minimum wage pay no income tax and those on the highest incomes cannot use tax relief schemes excessively to avoid paying any tax.  I include the charitable donations scheme in this regard because, while it is very laudable, it could be used disproportionately such that the exemptions available would enable some to pay no tax on their incomes.  This would defeat the purpose of the exercise.Our record on taxation is evident to all.  This year, nearly 846,000 persons will be outside the tax net, compared to just 380,000 in 1997.  This represents a significant achievement in the context of a workforce of more than 2 million.  Some 600,000 new jobs have been created in the past ten years.  Allied to this achievement, the Government has maintained its commitment to keeping business taxes low to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the economy, and it will continue to do so.Senator John Phelan implied that taxpayers are highly taxed because the Government, through some form of stealth, is using VAT to increase the Exchequer's tax yield.  This is not the case.  In 1997, under the Rainbow coalition, indirect taxes, comprising VAT and customs and excise duty, amounted to 45% of the total tax take.  In 2002 they amounted to 46% and the forecast for 2007 is approximately 43%.  This represents a slight fall in the share of the overall tax burden accruing from indirect taxes since 1997.  A slight increase in Exchequer taxes as a percentage of GNP, of approximately 2.8%, is expected in 2007.  The increase is entirely attributable to capital taxes — about 3.3% for taxes as a percentage of GNP.Senator John Paul Phelan made a point about effective tax rates and the number of income earners paying at the higher rate.  Unlike the old allowance system, the tax credit system works by first calculating the tax liability at 20%, and 41% where applicable, and then deducting from the tax so calculated the value of the individual's tax credits.  The allowance used to be applied before one got into the marginal tax rate.  For some people, when the credits are taken away, they are left with no tax liability, others are left with a liability which, as a percentage of their pay is less than the standard rate and for the remainder they will pay somewhere between 20% and 41%, on average.The bottom line is when people earn €30,000 a year and they pay €6,000 in tax, they pay 20% of their income on tax.  It is semantics to suggest we have not made this commitment.  Not alone have we made the commitment, we have taken 40% of taxpayers out of the tax net altogether.  It was a central part of our taxation policy during the course of this tenure of office to exclude people on the minimum wage from the tax net, and to do so two and three times in a row because it is in the interests of social equity to do so.  Whether one can do that ad infinitum is something we will have to consider.  A certain point may arrive after which one may not be able to continue to do that.  During our term of office we said we would take people on the minimum wage out of the tax net.  We have done this for 846,000 people compared with 380,000 ten years ago out of a much lower number of people at work at that time — 1.34 million compared with 2.066 million, which is the third quarter figure from the Central Statistics Office.I do not accept the points made either in regard to criticism of our spending programme.  Overall, we have succeeded in keeping public finances within sound and sustainable overall parameters — which we will continue to do if we are returned to office — to the extent that this country's overall economic and budgetary position is now the envy of Europe and, as Senator Quinn stated, perhaps even further afield.  The national debt is among the lowest in Europe, we are running a healthy budget surplus, the economy is strong and unemployment is low.  The Government has put in place a comprehensive value for money framework that addresses every aspect of public expenditure from the planning phase right through to implementation and delivery.  We are taking concrete and innovative steps to promote value for money and to link public expenditure with public service outcomes.Regarding forecasting, Senator John Paul Phelan referred to underestimations of tax revenues.  Senator Mansergh made a comment on that which is probably accurate.  It is difficult to get these estimates correct for a variety of reasons.  First, if one looks back 30 years under all Governments, we find in fact that one of the biggest errors was made in 1976 by a Fine Gael and Labour Government when the forecasts were more than 10% out.  The recent poor forecasting performance has been due to rapid increases in stamp duties and capital gains tax.  There is no political input into these forecasts under this or previous Governments of any colour.  As for the methodology for tax forecasts, I have instigated a root and branch review using the resources of the Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the ESRI, the Central Bank and the European Commission.  The last review we carried out was in 1998 and we published that report.For the record, we have forecast VAT, income tax, corporation tax and excises, the big four which represent 85% of tax revenue, fairly well and this is encouraging to some degree.  I am conducting a review to find out what is the best forecasting projection, given the rate of growth we are achieving, the different nature of the economy and the varied levels of business in which we are engaged.  I want accurate figures too.  It is nonsense to suggest we are purposely underestimating.  If one takes a tax base of anything more than €50 billion and one is 2% out, that is €1 billion.  That is a lot of money but it is only 2% on a base of €50 billion.  These are projections based on statistics and one does the best one can.Trends can change.  For example, the slowdown in the property market that would happen if we were to introduce Fine Gael's stamp duty regime would put my figures out of kilter pretty quickly.  I certainly will not be underestimating if that is introduced.  This idea is just not thought through.  I ask that it be reconsidered.  How can one introduce a stamp duty regime over a three-year period and suggest it will not dislocate the market?  In effect, this would signal to people who want to get into the housing market that they should stay out for as long as they can because the longer they stay out, the better will be the deal on stamp duty.  That is crazy.  It does not make any sense.  It was not thought through.  I respectfully ask, as the Fine Gael Party concentrates on currying favour with the 50,000 people who are in the transaction market this year and annually, what will be the effect on the equity that has built up in their properties in recent years of the 1.6 million householders who are not in the business of buying or selling property?

This will come home to roost; it will not work.  I say this for a purpose.  As Minister for Finance, I am duty bound to say it.  I do not engage in speculation on these matters for obvious reasons and I do not think anybody else should be engaged in speculation either.  There are procedures that can be followed if people want to seek taxation reform.  It is not done on the basis of implementing a proposal over the next three years.  Based on the figures for houses sold in the first ten months of last year, only 3,990 people out of a total of 44,500 bought houses valued at more than €635,000.  As Senator Mansergh stated, it is proposed to reduce stamp duty for people who buy houses worth in excess of €700,000, but at the same time no effort is made to give a few extra bob to ordinary working people by indexing the tax bands.  Fine Gael proposes to spend €460 million on 50,000 people and put at risk the equity of 1.6 million households.  If that is the kind of Government we will have if Fine Gael is elected, I can guarantee the Celtic tiger will not roar too long.On price inflation, the trend for 2007 is expected to be downward and more so from mid-year.  We have passed the peak that was largely due to European Central Bank interest rate rises and international oil prices.  When inflation is measured on a common EU basis, with mortgage interest stripped out, it is 2.6% compared with 1.8% on average in the eurozone.  Our growth is three times the eurozone rate.  That is not a bad performance, comparatively speaking, but we need to remain vigilant.I am pleased the business expansion and seed capital schemes have been welcomed, as has the introduction of the mid-Shannon scheme.  I have published all the cost benefit analyses of all these schemes and they are available on the website.  They are in line with the recommendations from the consultants that we would have a time-limited, targeted approach to see if they would work out.I made my point on stamp duty.  However, the emphasis and the consistent policy in the housing market has always been to try to assist first-time buyers.

It is vital to have first-time buyers entering the market.  In three budgets I made two carefully calibrated initiatives on stamp duty for first-time buyers: increasing the thresholds in 2005 and this year; and doubling the mortgage interest subsidy up to €125,000, not just for those going into the market to buy a house but also for those who have been in that market for the past six years, given that there had been some slight interest rate rises and to help cushion them against any problem in that regard.One must be most careful about what one does with the housing market.  One should not play politics with it.  Approximately 260,000 families have members working in the construction industry.  This represents 15% to 16% of GNP.

A dialogue is required on that area.  There is no doubt that private wealth has increased.  We have not had a culture of philanthropy in the past of any great magnitude because not many people had the wealth to be philanthropic.  In all these issues we must have balance between the public policy objective of ensuring that people can provide assistance to worthy causes through the charities Acts and so on while not allowing total discretion to those with assets to decide how those moneys will be spent if they do not come through the Exchequer system.  In other words, we must ensure that everyone is seen to be paying their fair share while at the same time finding a means that will enable this culture of philanthropy to flourish.  I am interested to discuss that issue in the coming months and hear what people have to say about it to ensure it is dealt with maturely and properly and not be considered subsequently to be some means of helping people on higher incomes to do as they wish with their income while keeping it out of the tax system.I understand the point being made and agree that in wealthy societies it has proven to be an issue that is being accommodated.  The Senator mentioned the private benefaction in American colleges and because of the level of benefaction, many of those major universities are the leading research centres of the world in a range of scientific and other areas.I set up the Social Finance Foundation, which is a financial intermediary through which it is open to people in the private sector to subscribe to the Social and Finance Foundation.  Where they do not have individual discretion on specific projects they wish to fund they are enabled to contribute to a foundation which is seeking to grow social finance and bring social capital to the communities of Ireland in a way that is more general in character than specific in terms of getting tax relief to do a specific project.  I may be interested in asking people to consider a tax relief in respect of a general benefaction to such a foundation.  Those people would know that the money they put forward would go towards purposes with which they would generally agree.  That is an area for consideration in the context of that debate.  I will get back to the Senator on the specific points he raised because I will not be able to cover them here.Senator Cox raised specific issues and although they are not my line responsibility, that does not mean I am not interested in them being resolved.  A propaganda line has been pushed by members of the Opposition throughout the west——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	223	——that we are not providing the moneys due to the BMW region.  It is not correct to say that €3 billion has not been spent in the BMW region that would otherwise be spent.  One of the economic programmes was based on whether there would be a take-up from business.  That did not happen and obviously that money was not spent.It is not just a question of money spent up to 2006.  Under the Community Support Framework there is a further period in which the money allocated will be spent.  I can give the Senator a detailed briefing which makes the point I am making to her.  It is perhaps an understandable but inaccurate analysis of the position to suggest that the BMW region is being denied its due allocations for some reason.The ESRI review of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 indicates that the income disparities between the regions are reducing.  The ESRI will confirm that.  The 2007 to 2013 national development plan is another major effort to continue the trend of trying to achieve balanced regional development.  We have not had balanced regional development in this country, which is unfortunate.  When the development began it was in the major conurbations and was Dublin centric in the main because we did not have regional development but we are effecting regional development.  The national spatial strategy, which sets out where the country is going in the next 20 years in that respect, is the first overall strategy ever adopted and we ensure that the allocations under the national development plan are aligned with national spatial strategy objectives.One of the main tasks that must be done if we are to effect balanced regional development is to create critical mass in the regions.  My own midlands region is a particular challenge because we do not have a city like Galway, Sligo, Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Letterkenny-Derry.  An examination of some of the income disparities indicates that the central midlands region, from Longford to rural Carlow, are the areas of most deprivation in rural Ireland.  Thankfully, the west has progressed immeasurably.  Galway is the fastest growing city in Ireland.  It is a tremendous city.  I accept there are challenges.  Senator Cox mentioned the health services.  I was glad, as Minister for Health and Children, to invest over €70 million to develop that area.  It had to be done and is being done.

On the Senator's specific question about the paediatric unit, etc., we can take it up with the Minister for Health and Children but major investments have been made in the health services and the road network in the west.  Regarding the National Development Plan 2007-2013, I have reprioritised the Limerick-Galway road, including the outer orbital for Galway.  That was the first job to be done after the national motorway system was completed.  We are now bringing forward the plans regarding that matter to ensure that Transport 21 will affect that roadway to be done.  The Senator has also heard the proposal about the rail and so on.I do not want to get into a contentious argument with the Senator on these matters but there are many positive developments in the BMW region generally.  The western corridor road, for example, will be a major counterbalancing point in terms of national transport systems.  Incidentally, all of those roads go through the midlands.  They will not be in my constituency but we will not complain about that.  We intend to make our way in the world as best we can.  The population is rising in the west, thankfully.  Many developments are taking place there.  The historic position of the west has dramatically changed in the past ten years.  There is more work to be done——

I have confirmed that the national spatial strategy and the alignment of national development funding in the next seven years will greatly accelerate that trend in the right direction.  It is true that unless we effect regional development and ensure that is our top priority in the coming years, the imbalance in development we have seen could continue.  We want to stop that.  We devised the spatial strategy to overcome it but that is not to say we should not have had development in the first place.  This country has come from a period of under-capitalisation historically but with the level of economic activity we have achieved we must ensure there is greater balance in that activity, not just in the west but in my part of the country as well.  In terms of IDA approved jobs, the west has done much better than my region.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this benefit to all Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the extension of child benefit to all children in the State.".I welcome the Minister to the House.  This amendment refers to approximately 1,600 children of asylum seekers in receipt of direct provision.  I understand the legislation we passed a few years ago provided that people who come to this country seeking asylum are not entitled to social welfare benefits.  I can understand the reasoning behind the legislation, which had its effect of making it less attractive for certain people to come here.  On the other hand some families are living in direct provision, getting a few euro each week.  I accept they get their lodgings and food.  However, my concern and that of people who deal with children in poverty is that the children of these families are living in poverty.  How can a parent of a family in receipt of direct provision getting approximately €10 per week buy shoes or clothes for children, or give them an occasional little treat?  I am sure it is not even for treats but simply to provide them the essentials.Some of these families will eventually be granted asylum and will continue to live here.  However, I am concerned at what damage it is doing to the children in the meantime.  Is there any way to cater for the small number of children involved without greatly upsetting the provisions in the legislation in order to ensure that children will not go without the necessities and that we do not deny them treats that they would need.  That treat might include activities that would be of benefit to them, for example allowing them to come into town for a day or go to see a movie.  People do not have the money for such matters.  I believe we are discriminating against children and it may have an adverse effect.  We should be able to include all children and treat them equally, particularly given that such a small group is involved.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	252	As the Senator knows, child benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides.  Since 1 May 2004 the qualified person must satisfy the habitual residence condition.  The requirement was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the labour market to workers from the ten EU member states that acceded at that time without the transitional limitations.  As we were one of only three member states to open our markets in 2004, it was necessary to build in some protections to our systems.  The effect of that condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere does not receive social welfare payment on arrival in Ireland.  From 1 May 2004 until 31 January 2007, the number of child benefit claims that required particular examination of the habitual residence condition was 16,092.  Of these only 1,557, less than 10%, were disallowed.Those who are refused child benefit are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided — I suspect these are the people the Senator has in mind — who do not have a work permit, or who have only a minimal attachment to the workforce here.  The habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose.  It is allowing access to our social welfare system to those who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their place of habitual residence.  At the same time it is preventing unwanted access by persons with little or no connection with the State.  Obviously the State must strike a fine balance in that regard.  The legislation specifies five factors in determining what constitutes habitual residence.  These include the length and continuity of residence, employment prospects, reasons for coming to Ireland, future intentions and the person's centre of interest, for example their family or home connections.Asylum seekers come under a different area and it is important to distinguish between the two.  The Refugee Appeals Tribunal provided the following figures.  Some 933 asylum seekers are awaiting initial decision and 2,669 asylum seekers are appealing their refusal.  The number of appeals refused and awaiting final decision on application to the Minister for leave to remain has not yet been determined.  On 28 March 2007 there were 5,724 asylum seekers in direct provision, comprising 4,014 adults and 1,710 children.  The cost of that direct provision in 2006 was €78.7 million.  As I said on Committee Stage in the Dáil, I am anxious to do everything we can to ensure that no child in our jurisdiction is in any way deprived of support.  Asylum seekers are directly provided for.  That direct provision is designed to support child and adult asylum seekers.  The others who are here come under the scope of the habitual residence legislation and only 10% of those who required examination under that provision were disallowed between May 2004 and January 2007.  The number of child benefit claims that required examination under the habitual residence condition was 16,092.  I am satisfied the balance is right between extending the benefits of our welfare system to as many people as require it and protecting the Irish taxpayer in so far as possible.  It always will be a case of balance, but given that, unlike most other countries, we opened our country in 2004, it is certainly a policy we are duty bound to pursue.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I should have made the point that I understand the difference between those to whom the habitual residence condition would apply and asylum seekers.  I apologise for not making this clear.All I can say to the Minister is that we should keep a close eye on this.  The amendment suggests that a report be laid before the House within three months.  I know this will probably not happen either, but it is something on which we need to keep a close eye to ensure the rules we make which have an impact on people do not have an adverse impact on children, particularly since it concerns a small and, presumably, dwindling number.  I will not press the amendment.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a second-tier, employment-neutral, child income support payments to target child poverty levels.".This amendment asks that a report on the introduction of second-tier, employment-neutral, child income support payments to target child poverty levels be laid before the House.  I accept that much has been done to combat child poverty.  Unfortunately, children from low-income families still live in poverty.  We need to do more, despite the good work done by the Minister in targeting low-income families.We need to introduce the special second-tier payment for families on very low incomes.  As I said earlier, I do not believe any taxpayer would object to ensuring that children do not go to bed without food in their stomachs or go to school without a breakfast.  The latter issue was raised here this morning.  It appears it is not just children from poor families who go to school without a breakfast, but this is another issue that probably concerns parenting.  Some children go to school without a breakfast, go to bed hungry and do not get a new school coat or pair of shoes when they are needed.  These are the families we need to target with this second-tier payment.I accept the new qualified child allowance has been established to target the poorest children.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments about the introduction of this second-tier payment, which has been discussed for some time at the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and in this House.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  If even one child in this country lives in any kind of poverty, it shames us all.  Progress must be made to ensure this cannot continue.  I have said many times that it is unacceptable in the 21st century that even one child should live in any kind of poverty in a country whose economy grew last year by 7%, the highest rate in almost any developed country in the world.  This was an astronomical rate of economic growth and progress and it behoves us to channel and target funds.  This is why, in the budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and I specifically targeted income support costing more than €240 million to benefit children in low-income families and families on social welfare.  This is why we dramatically improved the old child dependant allowance, which Senator Terry rightly notes is now called the qualified child allowance, and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and channelled resources to low-income families in particular.We could have increased child benefit across the board.  Instead, we specifically targeted additional funds of more than €60 million at the lowest one third of children in terms of income.  This was the first time in 12 years this shift happened and it is one which I believe is required.I am fully committed to a second-tier payment.  The National Economic and Social Council has been examining this for a long time and has told me it is very complicated and complex because there are poverty traps, points at which one comes in and out of the system and disincentives which can be built into it.  I decided not to wait for this process to be completed.  Instead, the Minister for Finance and I decided to channel approximately €60 million at the lowest one third of children in terms of income.  Instead of introducing an across-the-board increase in child benefit, which has been the pattern for 12 years and did much good work, I felt strongly that the time had come to say it was not necessary to go all the way across the board with those funds and that we should target a disproportionate amount of them at the lowest one third of children on that ladder.  This began in January of this year.  It is not something that has been committed; it is working and those funds are being paid weekly to those families.As the Senator knows, we have increased family income supplement thresholds dramatically.  The family income supplement scheme provides a considerable amount of funds for low-income families.  We have substantially increased the thresholds this year.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, we have undertaken a promotion campaign to encourage more people to apply for that payment and, consequently, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of people applying.  At present, 21,000 families are in receipt of family income supplement, which benefits 43,000 children.Child poverty is predominantly located in the overlap between the lone parents allowance and family income supplement.  This is why we specifically targeted the thresholds, the family income supplement incomes and did not increase child benefit across the board.  While some of the increases were implemented across the board, we targeted a substantial amount of funds at the bottom rate.In budget 2007, the old three child dependant allowance rates were increased and consolidated into one rate of €22.  This represents a more selective approach to child income support, targets poorer households and, at the same time, limits the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.Incidentally, child benefit is paid to more than 560,000 families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children.  I do not disagree with the Senator's analysis, except to indicate that whoever has the responsibility of Government or the responsibility of having been elected to this or the other House must ensure resources and funds are channelled into areas where they can make a difference to the lives of people rather than being spread too thinly across the board.  This is what the Minister for Finance and I did in the recent budget and this work must continue.

I hope we will see progress in that regard, perhaps in the coming budget.  Obviously, we must wait and see who will be in charge then, but whoever is should continue this trend in the next budget.   As the Minister said, no child should go hungry or be without appropriate clothing, although we know that happens.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for instance, could say how many families on low incomes are struggling to put food on the table.  Sometimes it is not just about money but about training people how to manage their budgets.  Far be it from me to try to tell anyone how to do so when they are dealing with a very small amount to start with.  If they have children, it can cost a lot more nowadays, especially given the price of food.  The quality of food children eat is also an important issue.  More work needs to be done in this area and I look forward to progress being made in the next budget.

In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of direct payment of the qualified adult allowance to all qualified adults.".I compliment the Minister on the changes that were brought about in the budget as a result of his work in this area.  We had called on him to address the situation of people in receipt of State pensions, especially women.  We all felt it was grossly unfair that they did not receive such payments in their own right.  I welcome the fact that that has now been brought about.  My only concern is that there is still a little opt out clause whereby people can choose to have the payment made jointly or to somebody else.  My concern is that where there is a way out, it may still be difficult for some people to be strong enough to say that they want this payment made directly to them.  I would like to see that copperfastened to ensure that no individual — this concerns mostly older women — will be intimidated or otherwise put in a situation where they would not get this payment directly into their own hands.  I compliment the Minister on taking this matter on board and correcting the anomaly.

I suppose that in everything one does, one would prefer to go further but I acknowledge the generosity of her remarks.  I have announced significant improvements in the rate of State pensions for qualified adults as well as important changes in the way these payments will be made.  I am also committed to improving the rate for qualified adults to bring them up to the rate of the non-contributory State pension over a three-year period.  The changes will involve amending the existing arrangements to provide that in the case of new claimants to the State pension scheme, the qualified adults increase will be paid directly to the qualified adult, as the Senator said.  Customers who wish to be paid their pension jointly will continue to be facilitated.  I note the Senator's comments about leaving some gaps for people to opt out.  The revised arrangements will apply to all new applicants to the State pension scheme with effect from 24 September 2007.The position regarding payments to people of working age is a little less straightforward, and a separate payment may not be appropriate in certain schemes.  It is open to dependent spouses or parents to claim payments, such as the job seeker's allowance, in their own right, subject to satisfying means and other conditions.  The decision announced in the budget, which is provided for in this Bill, applies to the State pension contributory, State pension transition, and State pension non-contributory.  There is no decision yet to extend direct payment to other schemes at this point, but the matter is being examined by the Department.Senator Terry and I have had many discussions in the House.  I know the view has been expressed many times about the importance of the welfare system being fairer to women.  Over the past two years, I have formed the view that that was not the case.  That is why we have made dramatic changes in a range of areas, including for lone parents who can now earn up to €400 without their allowance being affected.  That starts the process of freeing up lone parents and liberating other areas as well.It is important to continue to drive forward this type of work.  It will take some years to reach the point on pensions or in other areas where women are treated as well and as generously in the welfare system.  We have a range of issues concerning marriage bars, averaging stamps, or contributions as they are now called, work records, and the home maker's allowance.  Every time I meet women's group, their representatives impress upon me all the gaps that can appear in their contribution systems because they have other duties.  The forthcoming Green Paper on pensions, to be published in mid-April, will examine some of those issues.  We will see then if suggestions are forthcoming to develop some of those issues, especially in the contributory and non-contributory pension area.  This move is a useful first step in that, from September, such payments will be made directly.

In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the progress to date in replacing the One Parent Family Payment with the new parental allowance for all low income families.".We are targeting one-parent families, which are those most at risk.  It is not always necessarily the case that a single-parent family would be more at risk than a low-income family with both parents.  However, we have generally found that the former category is most at risk.  I therefore ask the Minister to provide an update on the progress that has been made on the new parental allowance.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	269	As the Senator is probably aware, last year's Government discussion paper, which I think we discussed in this House, was entitled Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents.  It contained proposals for an expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents.  It recommended the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents, focusing on the provision of child care in particular as well as on providing improved information services for lone parents, and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low-income families with young children.  That discussion document also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed new social assistance payment.  The Senator will recall that one of the document's proposals was that the upper income limit for the new payment, instead of the lone parent payment, should be set at €400 per week.  In the 2006 budget, the Minister for Finance and I increased the upper income limit on the one-parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week, and in the recent budget we completed this process by bringing the limit to €400 per week.  Provision for this is contained in this legislation.  This is a commitment towards the recommendations in the report.The new payment that has been developed by officials in the Department will have the long-term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence by supporting them to enter employment.  It will replace the lone parent payment and will be based on low-income families, irrespective of their make-up.  Whether children reside in low- income families that consist of two or more people will be irrelevant.  The only measure will be that the children are part of a low-income family.  Work in this regard is progressing well and the development of legislation is being prioritised in the Department.The various groups involved asked me to ensure that when we progress with this new legislation, we move in parallel on other issues such as child care, health care provision, education and training provision, and so on.  They wanted these other areas to be addressed simultaneously so there will be integration and joined-up Government when all this clicks into place.  We agreed to this, and the senior officials group on social inclusion has been instructed to draw up an implementation plan and is doing so.In the meantime, the Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, has agreed with the Government that the proposals should be tested in urban and rural settings.  The tests will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced and will allow for logistical and operational co-ordination to be planned.Deputy Penrose rightly pointed out in the Dáil that when we introduce this legislation, we must be certain it does not create unintended welfare or poverty gaps.  A way to ensure this is to press ahead with these tests in urban and rural settings with the results informing the finalisation of the drafting of the legislation.I am disappointed that I could not have brought this legislation before the House sooner but it is too important to be rushed to meet political deadlines.  Many years of good work were spent on the preparation of the report by the social inclusion committee, officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Combat Poverty Agency and all the agencies, and a senior officials group is now driving it ahead.  This fundamental reform will see legislation in the course of 2007 and whoever has the honour to serve in Government will press ahead with it.  Pending that legislation, we have made substantial progress by moving to the limit of €400 recommended in the report that permits lone parents to engage in employment and training and to develop quality employment for themselves.We have come some distance on this matter and thanks to Opposition parties and the media, this did not turn into a political football, as is possible in the sensitive area of lone parents.  I am convinced this legislation will be passed by both Houses in due course.  In the meantime, we have made solid changes in the recent budget that help lone parents greatly.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank the Minister for his response and share his regret that he was not able to act more quickly on many of the good recommendations included in the lone parents proposals document published in February 2006.  I understand what the Minister has said and realise that much work must be done across a number of Departments to ensure we get this right.  We are dealing with a critical area and I compliment the Minister on the action he has taken in trying to help lone parent families in poverty and on accepting that the best way to remove people from poverty is through education and retraining.The crux of the issue lies in deciding how to ensure we educate and retrain people to a standard that will make working worthwhile.  There is no point pushing people out to work if the income they receive is not sufficient to lift them from poverty.  Too often we hear adults saying that working is not worthwhile by the time transport to and from work, the cost of child care and suitable work clothing are taken into account.  There are many costs associated with going out to work and we must ensure the level of education and retraining people receive is of a high standard.  This may take a number of years.The majority of the people in question may not have a leaving certificate and that is where we need to start on this issue.  The process could take years of re-education through school and proper training to ensure work is made worthwhile.  This will have a knock-on effect on the children of people being re-educated.We must be careful about forcing people out to work, even when their children are as young as eight years of age.  The type of work people receive is important and, as I mentioned yesterday, we must examine the community employment, CE, model and how it has worked well for many people.  Some of this work does not qualify participants for much at the end of three years but it tends to be local work with flexible hours and nearby child care facilities, which cuts down on transport costs.  Finding child care before and after school and during holiday periods can create huge difficulties for people going back to work.There are many aspects to this issue that require time and examination and I understand that this is why the legislation has been slow to come before us.  We must not force people back into the workplace if they are not ready.  It is up to us to put the facilities and mechanisms in place to ensure people can achieve a certain standard of education and training.  This will enable people to obtain a high standard of job that will provide a decent income.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I am delighted to be here today because I spoke on this area relating to lone parents on Second Stage last night and was very concerned.  This Bill reflects society's position on how to approach the issue of lone parents.  We have started to establish infrastructure for co-ordination between various Departments.  The Department of Education and Science has made reasonable progress in this regard through home-school links, remedial teachers and programmes such as the vocational training opportunities scheme and Youthreach.  Communities and schools have a major role to play in assisting lone parents to re-enter the education system because many of them lack the self-esteem needed to do so.I hope the Department of Social and Family Affairs will establish infrastructure to help lone parents.  Child care, for example, needs to be tightened up because lone parents will argue they cannot return to education due to the shortage of childminders.  I have a special interest in lone parents dating back to a previous employment when I dealt with many disadvantaged lone parents.  As the Minister indicated, some tightening up remains to be done.  I ask him to comment.I did not discuss every aspect of the legislation on Second Stage because it would have taken me half the evening to do so.  It is a great Bill, which has many good provisions, tackles a series of problems and reflects the nature of society.  I wish the Minister well with it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I thank Senators for their comments on the section.  I read carefully Senator Ormonde's contribution on the Second Stage debate and noted her emphasis on the need to put in place integrated education and training programmes.The purpose of the reforms is to ensure people have a choice because until now many lone parents have not had choices.  This has left bright young people trapped and unable to see a way out of their predicament.  The way out for them is to acquire education, training, skills and income while, at the same time, caring for and supporting their child or children.  This formula lies at the heart of my reforms and has been applied over two budgets.  Once the reforms are complete, the designation of "one parent family" will no longer be used.  Instead, payment will be targeted solely at families on low incomes, irrespective of whether they are headed by a married or cohabiting couple or a single parent.  As Senators will be aware, I have always believed that focusing on family arrangements is out of date in terms of 21st century social policy.  We are making good progress and we will reach our destination.  I thank Senators Ormonde and Terry for their comments on lone parents.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this targeted supports Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of targeted social and community supports for young carers.".As the Minister will be aware, a sizeable number of young people act as carers and do vital work in their families.  Does the national carer's strategy include proposals to help young people who perform this role?  While canvassing in their constituencies politicians encounter young persons, often teenagers, who act as a parent to younger siblings or look after a parent who may have a disability.  As the Bill does not make any provision for this group, has the Minister suggested that the national carer's strategy group recommend the provision of additional home help or other useful measures?Some children miss out on education and do not attend school every day due to problems at home or because they are needed to care for a sick relative, usually a parent.  Young children in this position need assistance.  Their education and social life should not suffer on account of the work they must do or the demands placed on them by their families.  How will the national carer's strategy deal with this group?  What progress has been made on the strategy?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Discussions are taking place between Departments to progress the national carer's strategy.  One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, is the development of a national carer's strategy which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare support is a key element of the strategy, other issues also arise, including access to respite and other services, education, training and employment, all of which will feature strongly in the strategy.  Significant interdepartmental co-operation and discussions are taking place to determine if we can make urgent progress on the strategy.I had planned to establish a forum for carers in the coming weeks to commence the national carer's strategy.  However, Deputy Stanton, speaking in the Other House, proposed that I agree to a postponement because the forum could be affected by political timescales.  Having considered his proposal, I have agreed not to proceed with it.  I hope carers will not misinterpret my decision as indicating a lack of support because the opposite is this case.  The purpose of the postponement is to ensure we do not embroil carers in political controversy.The Government has made great strides in respect of carers in recent budgets.  I am particularly proud to have changed the age-old rule that a person in receipt of a carer's payment was not eligible for any other social welfare payment.  This meant that carers could receive only one payment.  Following the change, carers may retain their social welfare payment and receive carer's allowance at half rate.  This is a major advance which can be worth up to €100 per week.  A consistent complaint from those on welfare who wanted to provide care was that they would lose their welfare payment if they chose to act as a carer, although they may have been eligible for a carer's payment.  Under the new rules such persons will receive one and a half payments.  This is a major step forward as it recognises the work done by those who provide care.I pay tribute to my opposite number in the Other House, Deputy Stanton.  Since I took office some two and a half years ago, he has regularly brought to my attention the issue of younger carers.  While we have not been able to see eye to eye on the issue, I hope it will be addressed in the national carer's strategy and I will request that the group endeavour to make further progress in this area.Towards 2016 committed the Government to undertake a study of the extent to which children undertake inappropriate care roles in order to establish the degree to which the practice arises and the level of impact it has on the lives of children concerned.  The partnership agreement further states that, based on the outcome of the study and an analysis of the issues identified, a programme of in-home supports will be developed to alleviate specific problem areas identified for children.  This provision is in line with the report, Caring Before Their Time? Research and Policy Perspective on Young Carers, published by Barnardos at the Children's Research Centre in September 2004.This report considered that further research would be undertaken on the number of young carers, the supports available to them, their needs and the impact of their caring role on their education and general development.  The report found that of an estimated 3,000 young carers who were providing some care, there were over 300 carers between the ages of 15 and 17 who it was estimated were providing full-time care.  Special help, advice and support are essential for people like this, who are often caring for a parent, as well as particular services which should be put in place to support the household and ensure young carers can remain at school.  These include the home help and public health nurse services and home care packages generally.  The HSE would also be involved.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Is it 300 or 3,000?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	276	It is 300.  The report found that of an estimated 3,000 young carers who were providing some care, there were over 300 between the ages of 15 and 17 who were providing full-time care.  It is obviously a bit of both.In terms of income support for young carers, the respite care grant is payable from the age of 16 and the carer's allowance is payable from the age of 18.  Deputy Stanton and I have debated this issue over the years.  People of this age should not have to do this kind of work.  If one is aged 15 to 17, one's place is in school and one should not be sucked into this situation.  However, in the real world, there are 300 carers who have been sucked into it.Successive Ministers took the view that if a carer's allowance is paid to a 15 year old, this does not solve the problem.  It arguably makes it worse because it enables the 15 year old to continue to do the caring when the solution is to ensure the 15 year old does not have to do it by developing home help, home care and public health nurse services, and home care packages and support so the 15 year old can go to school.  Many of the 3,000 involved are caring after school, in the evening and at weekends, which is why the respite care grant is paid from the age of 16.I will recommend strongly to the national carer's strategy process that it would address this issue with some vigour because it is not fair to the persons being cared for or those doing the caring to find even 300 people in this situation.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I agree with the Minister that we need to address this problem.  To have 3,000 people caring for so many hours of the week and to have 300 caring full time is unacceptable.  No child should have to do this and give up his or her education and social life.  The children who do this are wonderful, but that is what they are in this context — children.  We are depriving them of an awful lot.  This could be easily solved by providing services to the family in terms of home help and whatever other services they require to enable children to have the freedom to attend school, get out to play and do the things any normal teenager would be doing.Nothing is easy but this is not a difficult area to resolve for 300 families.  When the strategy is put in place, I hope the matter will be quickly dealt with.  We should not let another year pass in which any child must stay at home to look after a parent.  I agree with the Minister's sentiments and would like to see progress made.I hope the carers will not be disappointed that the forum is being postponed, which is a good idea.  I am sure they will be understanding of the reasoning behind this.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the impact of the individualisation of the means-test for Carers Allowance applicants.".We have probably covered this ground in referring to carers.  In this context, I will assume a carer is not a child but an adult who is caring for a young child with a disability or an elderly parent.  The work carers do is fantastic but they had not been given the recognition they deserved over the years until recently.  I recognise the benefits the Minister brought to many carers by improving the carer's grant, increasing the respite grant and making it easier for people to receive a grant or the carer's allowance.We want to ensure that anybody who is caring gets the allowance.  It is usually a woman who gives up work to care for somebody, although this is not always the case and I recognise there are men who also do this work.  Anybody, regardless of gender, who gives of their time to care for somebody should not in any way be discriminated against in terms of getting whatever benefit is available to them.I welcome the fact somebody who is in receipt of a welfare payment will now get half of the carer's benefit, which is great progress and a measure for which we have called.  I credit the Minister with bringing this about.Perhaps there is no need to emphasise the role of carers as we recognise the work they do and the money they save the State.  We know that people, particularly older people, are much better off in their own homes than in nursing homes.  Wherever possible, if somebody can be accommodated and looked after at home, and given all the services that person needs to stay at home, this must be supported.  I hope nobody would be denied a carer's benefit or allowance because of a means test.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I compliment the Minister and his officials on the improvements that have taken place for carers.  I also compliment those who take on the role of carer, which results in a tremendous saving for the State.  Many thousands do valuable caring work and claim nothing whatever.  They put themselves out at great financial cost simply because of the needs of a relative.Senator Terry referred to the introduction of the measure whereby those on social welfare payment will receive half of the carer's payment.  This has been well received and great credit is due to the Department and the carers involved.  We recognise that carers' organisations are very active and have put much pressure on politicians to ensure the situation for carers is improved.Carers carry out magnificent and worthwhile work, often on a voluntary basis and in many cases on behalf of people who are not related to them.  Great credit is due to them.  I compliment the Minister on the improvements he has made.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank both Senators for their comments.  The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, particularly with the introduction of the disregard of the spouse's earnings.  Provision was made in the recent budget to increase the income disregard on the carer's allowance means test to €320 per week for a single person and €640 per week for a couple from April 2007.  This means a couple with two children can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance.  The same couple will be able to earn just over €57,500 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance, as well as free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.  In June 2006, average industrial earnings were estimated at €602 per week or €31,000 per annum.  Therefore, the recent increase surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a carer's allowance.On the removal of the means test, the cost is approximately €140 million in a full year.  Deputy Penrose has been pursuing me on this for a long time.  I have an open mind on its removal, but in respect of the approximate €140 million, I have chosen at this point to put that type of funding into improving the disregards and the amount of a carer's allowance so that those who do the job are better supported.  The disregards are increased dramatically as can be seen from the high levels in recent years.  Whether there should be a complete removal of the means test is an issue for debate.  It is really a matter of whether we should use the funds to allow everybody have a carer's allowance irrespective of income or whether we should use the funds to improve disregards and increase the allowance itself.Some 28,800 people are in receipt of carer's allowance and a further 1,800 are in receipt of carer's benefit.  Some 44,400 people will receive the respite care grant, which is not means tested, this year.  The current cost of the respite care grant is €66 million and the carer's allowance costs €342 million.  There have been strong improvements in the area of carers.I believe we are coming to a crossroads in respect of carers, which is why our strategy is so important.  We must stand back and define the role of a carer and decide whether we can continue supporting the role by way of income supports for people on low incomes or on welfare payments who find themselves caring or whether we need to look as caring more as an occupation.  The carer's strategy will have to look closely at this question.The Minister for Health and Children said recently that it costs four times as much to maintain a person in a residential institution than at home.  While we provide strong income supports, it is doubtful we can continue to respond to the situation in this manner or whether it is sustainable to do so for the future.  The strategy will have to face up to the question of whether the role of carer should be a more formal role in society.  If we make that change, there will be significant costs involved.  We should put the question on the table and examine the role of carers.  Carers must be cared for also.  If we do not care for them, the cared for will not get the kind of care they deserve.

In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"1.—The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the success of the rent supplement and rental accommodation schemes.".What progress has been made on the rental accommodation scheme and will the Minister clarify how it works?  I am concerned by the amount of money the State spends on rent on private houses.  Senator Cox mentioned this issue yesterday and it is a concern to many.  It seems a waste of money to pay out rents to private landlords on an ongoing basis when the money would be better spent on building social housing.  I am concerned by the delay in delivery of social and affordable housing by local authorities.My son lives in Pamplona in northern Spain and when visiting him recently, I was amazed by the amount of social and affordable housing being built in the city, which is approximately the size of Dublin 15.  I admire many aspects of how local government works there.  The city is small, but it is building thousands of local and affordable houses.  If the council in Pamplona can do it, why can we not do the same?  I cannot understand why we are so slow at delivering social and affordable housing while at the same time we spend significant sums of money paying rent to private landlords to provide accommodation.  Without the private landlords, we would be in a bad way, but perhaps if there was not such a significant stock of private housing available, the Government would be forced to deliver sooner.  I ask the Minister to address this point in his response.  Will he also outline the success of the rent supplement and rental accommodations schemes?
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Social welfare has, through subventions, supported people who are not in a position to provide themselves with accommodation.  However, I agree with Senator Terry on the need to review this.  When rent subvention was first introduced, it cost approximately €3 million per year, but as Ministers have increased subvention over the years, landlords have increased the cost of rented accommodation.There have been some improvements on accommodation.  In the past planning permission was granted for developments without a requirement to include social and affordable housing, but that has changed.  It is only now that we are beginning to see the benefit of this change, particularly in country areas.  There was a difficulty also with regard to the types of houses the Department insisted on for social and affordable housing.  Often it insisted on the building of three and four-bedroomed council houses despite most applicants being single or families with only one or two children.  Many of these people would have settled for a smaller dwelling, more of which could have been built from available funding.  The Department may have realised this eventually, but it lost valuable time that should have been used to provide suitable accommodation for people on the list.In general the system works well.  There were many complaints about the accommodation available in the past, but properties are now registered and there is an improvement in standards.  In the past, money was often paid directly to the person renting accommodation and was not always passed on to landlords.  These tenants were then evicted and new accommodation had to be found for them.  The improvements are welcome, but the situation must be watched carefully because the more the Minister increases the allowance, the more landlords increase the cost of accommodation in order to benefit from the increase.I compliment the Minister on the measures he has taken.  Were it not for them, many young couples and families would have a serious problem with regard to accommodation.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Senator Moylan's point is at the heart of this issue because the payments for rent supplement in 2000 were €150 million.  This year they will probably exceed €400 million covering 59,000 households.  Arguably the scheme has gone beyond its original intention which was to help young people.  It also helps many who are not young who might otherwise not be able to provide accommodation for themselves.  It was never intended to be a permanent solution but to be a support and get people to the point of having their own homes.That is why the Government introduced the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and made a further commitment in Towards 2016 to the procurement of an additional 1,000 private units under the social partnership agreement, and that is under way.  The affordable homes partnership has undertaken the procurement of up to 1,000 units of accommodation under public private partnership, PPP, on regional long-term contracts.  By the end of 2007, up to 10,000 tenants will have come off the rent allowance scheme and will be transferred over to the RAS or some other type of social housing.  That is important progress in taking the pressure off the RAS.  My Department will this year transfer approximately €25 million, up from €24 million in 2006 and €19 million in 2005, to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the provision of RAS to assist it in providing that accommodation.Of the 59,000 households on the RAS, 32,000 are eligible for assistance under the new arrangements.  We will press ahead with the RAS and seek to provide more social housing and permanent housing opportunities.  Life on rent supplement is neither easy nor a long-term solution.Considering that it accounts for up to 40% of the entire rental market in the State, we must cap the amount of rent paid.  We must adjust rents regionally and by size of apartment and recently did so.  Otherwise, we would be responsible, through State expenditure, for pushing up rents and leases and, arguably, house prices, which would not help those it should help.  Good progress is being made and the funds and people are being transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the RAS.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Progress is slow.  I am not sure whether that is the fault of the local authorities, although it probably is, or whether this proposal will be a success.  The length of time it takes to accommodate all these people under the RAS will determine its success.  Anything that can be done to increase its delivery will be helpful but I am sceptical as to how it will work out.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I appreciate that the Minister is passing people back to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government whose services it is hoped will improve as a result.  There are, however, thousands of houses that people have vacated because they have died, left or moved out that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not restoring to a habitable condition quickly enough.  It does excellent work to make housing suitable for people, with heating, etc. but the length of time that takes is a problem.  While that is happening, the Department of Social and Family Affairs continues to pay substantial rent for accommodation.  More co-operation between the two Departments and the local authorities, which are really responsible, to speed up the repairs is important.

In page 22, subsection (1), to delete lines 44 to 46 and in page 23 to delete lines 1 to 4.The new provision in this legislation whereby somebody in receipt of rent supplement would be barred from living in areas designated for urban regeneration marks a movement into a new era, denying people the right to choose where they live.  How constitutional is it and has the Minister received legal advice on the provision?  It reminds me of Wicklow County Council's declaration that only people from Wicklow could buy a house there.  I am not sure how that has progressed.It is wrong that anybody should be barred from living in an area of his or her choice, especially those who receive any type of welfare benefit.  The provision does not bar people on an annual income of more than €50,000 but those in receipt of rent supplement, which seems discriminatory.  Perhaps the Minister can explain it because I do not understand it.Some Members stated last night that this measure may be motivated by the views of private property owners.  I am not sure whether it is but I can understand how private property owners might want to ensure a certain type of person lives in their area.  The measure will come into play in Ballymun, parts of Cork and other areas and it seems very wrong.  The measure could be barring people from living in an area in which they really want to live because they have family connections there, or because it suits them for work purposes or any other reason one would choose an area in which to live.The Minister and I are free to live wherever we want, provided we can afford to do so.  Heretofore nobody said one could not live in a certain area if one was on a low income but we will now be saying this to certain individuals.  This is a backward step and it will be challenged in the courts.  We need to consider this provision very carefully before we proceed.  I am interested to hear the legal opinion of the Minister on this matter.  I presume he has obtained a legal opinion and we need to hear it today in the House.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The directive commenced in 2004 and, on the basis of legal advice, we are giving it statutory effect.  The Bill, including the section in question, has been cleared legally.  This does not stop anybody challenging legislation in the courts.  The Government operates according to the best legal advice available to it and it is satisfied that section 25 and the other relevant sections are legally sound.Section 25 provides that the payment of rent supplement may be refused, for the purpose of providing for greater social integration, in respect of accommodation situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as an area of regeneration.  Approximately €1 billion has been invested in the past ten years in programmes to improve certain local authority estates and in delivering homes and sustaining communities.  The recent statement on housing policy by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provides for a planned and concerted increase in investment in social housing stock over the coming years.  There has therefore been substantial investment in regeneration projects to tackle long-standing problems in communities that have experienced multiple disadvantages.  The measures in the Bill support the State's significant investment in areas of regeneration in addition to trying to meet the objective of creating sustainable communities.I do not know if Senator Terry had the opportunity to hear the contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, on this legislation.  He took the view that the provision is about assisting local authorities to achieve a social mix.  He stated we built vast local authority housing estates and high-rise developments in the past without making any attempt to achieve a sustainable mix.  He claimed regeneration projects are to provide a mixture of private, social, affordable and voluntary housing and are quite the opposite of social engineering.  Rather, they are to give some of the areas in question a chance to breathe and a fresh start.The Minister of State also said that, "In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s we built vast local authority housing estates and high-rise developments of between five and 15 storeys".  He argued that filling such private developments solely with recipients of rent supplement would not give the areas in which they are situated a chance to breathe and develop a sustainable future.The measures provided do not comprise a blanket refusal of rent supplement in the area of regeneration.  We made specific provision in the Bill to ensure that those already residing in areas of regeneration and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment.  Those already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation, and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future, will not have their entitlement restricted.  I do not envisage the restrictions lasting forever; it is a matter of giving the regeneration areas time to grow and develop and to provide breathing space, as stated by the Minister of State.  My Department will keep in close contact with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when implementing section 25 and we will keep the relevant matters under close and constant review.The provision is a means of not repeating automatically some of the mistakes made in the past.  While there are risks associated with the policy adopted, it is a better policy than that which obtained heretofore and it can be kept under constant review to observe how it is working.  It is as much in the interest of those receiving rent supplement as those who are not, and it is arguably very much in the interest of allowing areas to have a new beginning.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The Minister referred to problems in areas where large numbers of local authority houses were built.  I could point to many very badly built housing estates where individuals on low or no incomes were housed.  There are some in Tallaght and Blanchardstown, with which I am familiar, and others throughout the country.  One of the main problems associated with such estates was the lack of facilities.  Thousands of individuals were housed in areas where there was hardly a shop nearby.  This was the case in many parts of Blanchardstown.  Retailers sold groceries and chips from caravans and they thrived because there were no other shops nearby.  There was no swimming pool or playing field in some of the areas and, in some cases, residents had even to fight for schools.  These are the main reasons there were such grave problems in the areas in question, and there are still problems in the affected areas today.  Some did not even have a community centre and some still do not.I agree with the Minister that having a social mix is very important, and that it is difficult to achieve it in the areas in question.  It is not good for any community to have just one group of residents, be they unemployed or perhaps of a certain ethnic background.  We must learn lessons from the mistakes made in this regard but I am not sure the Government's proposal is the way to do so.  It will be interesting to see how it pans out.  To use that as the main reason for ensuring social integration and regeneration of an area, much more needs to be done.  I understand many additional social facilities have been put in place in Ballymun to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes we made in the past.  Building high-rise flats or apartments should not lead to problems.  People throughout Europe live in high-rise buildings and do not encounter the problems being experienced here.  If we expect families to live in high-rise buildings and the State has a responsibility for those families, we must ensure we maintain those buildings and the general environment, including the lifts and the cleaning of the buildings.I can take the Minister to see four or five storey buildings in the city that are a disgrace.  They are not in the Minister's constituency but they are not far from it.  The common areas are not cleaned regularly and even when they are cleaned, they are still not what the Minister and I would expect when we open our doors in the morning.  We will achieve social integration if we maintain the buildings, provide the local services and facilities and ensure we educate and train the people who live in those units.I am concerned about enshrining this provision in legislation.  Perhaps it could have been done in another way by proper management.  I do not like to see this type of legislation going through the Houses.  It is poor legislation which I am concerned about and cannot support.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	291	It is far too long ago to go into when I was elected to this House first but in those days, I was particularly concerned about homeless people.  We had a reasonably broad definition of "homeless", which was people who were unable to provide accommodation for themselves of a suitable standard or those who were living in shelters, hostels and such places.  We came up against a wall of institutional prejudice, starting with the comment that there were no homeless people.  It took a while to overcome that.  I do not believe there is anybody left in either the health or housing areas of public provision who does not accept that there are substantial numbers of homeless people.The next prejudice we met was that people were homeless because they chose not to take up the accommodation available to them, and we had the usual campaign to remove that particular one.  We then had people saying it was somebody else's problem.  The housing authorities said it was a health issue and the health authorities said it was a housing problem, and that had to be sorted out.  One after another we knocked down the prejudices and got what I believe to be a remarkable consensus.  First, there were homeless people, second, homeless people — primarily but not exclusively — needed housing, and third, the problem of homelessness would not be dealt with by housing people in ghettos because that was not the way to do it.Over the years I observed that people were slowly learning that the best way to develop housing was by mixing it.  That meant mixing various groups from the comparatively well-off to the comparatively badly off.  We now have a provision before the House, which I heard the Minister say has been in force since 2004 but is now being enshrined in legislation, which states that people who cannot afford to pay for their own accommodation because their income is so low are a problem.  In refusing to allow anyone from a category of people to live in an area, we are saying that anybody from that category will be bad for that area.  I have no problem with a sophisticated, intelligent planning service declining to allow lazy planners and officers of local authorities to turn estates into ghettos and social dumps, as has happened in the United Kingdom more so than here, and let people be lost.I know a good deal about this area.  I chaired the committee which considered the regeneration of St. Michael's estate in Inchicore and the experience for me was extraordinary.  I was amazed by the extraordinary resilience of the surviving tenants who wanted to make something out of their community.  They were the bravest people I have ever met.  People had to put steel plates on their doors because of what went on at night.  Their first activity every morning was to go out and sweep up the detritus — used condoms, discarded syringes and so on — from the landing outside.The fundamental problem was that Dublin City Council had turned into an absentee landlord because it allowed these places to be run down systematically.  They were among the best apartments ever built in terms of size, security, space, etc. but when the assembled so-called nasty people, not many of whom lived in the area, arrived at night, they broke all the lights.  These were not replaced because the retort from the council was they would be broken again.  They also put black plastic on the windows to ensure they could see the gardaí arriving in the dark but the gardaí could not see them.  I never heard the brave people who put up with all that and fought back say they did not want any poor people in their estate.  What they did not want was people whose behaviour was offensive and threatening to them.  The measure before the House is a plan to exclude a group of people for no reason other than they are poor.I have no problem with the Minister saying he wants social integration.  We are a country increasingly devoid of social integration.  Our children attend different schools, especially in second level where the children of the affluent increasingly, and in my view foolishly, queue to get into fee paying second level schools when there are perfectly good non-fee paying secondary schools, but that is what people are choosing.  We are dividing them up in terms of our health service.  We will have a private health service and a public health service for the poor, and now we are enshrining in legislation a provision to exclude the poor from certain areas.We should not concentrate on the extreme example.  We all know about obnoxious tenants.  We knew about them in St. Michael's estate and it took endless effort on behalf of the bravest people I know to get Dublin City Council to pay the least amount of attention to them, but the type of people who are indifferent to the plight of good, decent people in places such as St. Michael's estate love these simplicities because it makes it easy for them.  They do not have to deal with the individuals who behave badly.  They can exclude the whole class.I have to be careful in what I am about to say about a particular housing estate in Cork, not one made up of people on rent allowance but a middle class estate where a friend of mine lived 20 years ago.  He said his life was dominated by two houses in his street — both owner occupied — because on most weekends one or other of the families ended up out on the street for one reason or another due to alcohol or other factors.  It was not a case of poverty or social problems, other than drink and a family disintegration.  Can one imagine anybody putting into legislation a provision which stated that families would not be allowed to buy property in these areas if the husband has a drink problem; and that people would have to prove they do not have a drink problem, or that families would not be allowed to buy houses in these area unless a couple can show they have a stable relationship and there will not be any family violence?One can imagine the furore if the legislation stated no affluent gay couples would be allowed.  The world would blow up at the suggestion.  What if the Minister said no black people would be allowed.  I do not believe that is the Minister's intent, but this would be portrayed by at least one member of his party of whom I have nasty experience, as a way of keeping nasty people of different skin colour out of certain areas.  This man has used every other index, and he will use this one, to point out that due to the restrictions on rent allowance, certain people will not be able to live in some areas.I do not want to hear an argument about social integration, because we are in favour of social integration.  No sane person would take the opposite view.  Why is it only the poor who are the victims of this plan of social integration and what will happen if they are excluded from these areas?  Will we have a queue of people seeking regeneration — wonderful risk-taking entrepreneurs?  As I stated last night, it is about 25 years since anybody took a risk investing in property.  Will we have wonderful risk takers looking to regenerate area X, knowing full well the consequence would be that the grotties will be outside the walls?  I would like to hear from the Minister, not about social integration, but about why he believes it is necessary to have this most extraordinary legislative attempt to say, in effect, there are two kinds of people in society, those who deserve to be housed and to live in certain areas and those who are such an inherently threatening minority that we must keep them all out of certain areas?The solution is to ensure there is a proper mix of ownership and tenancies.  As any city manager will say, the demands for services from middle class estates are vastly greater than the demands from poorly run local authority estates.  In spite of the fact that the middle classes have more going for them, they are the ones who demand better lighting, roads, cleaning and everything else.  The people who need it most are the ones who are least likely to make demands.  If the Minister's left wing colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, were to put together a proposal that there would be proper planning, I would have no problem with it.  Does the Minister realise what he has written down here, that poor people will not be allowed to live in these areas?  If Robert Mugabe said something like that——

I know a good deal about what happens in housing.  The Minister has been a thoughtful and imaginative one in this portfolio and he has tried to work the pensions issue with some imagination.  I hope he does not give in to the business lobbies which are trying to send him off on a track that would make them a lot of money and not do much for our pensions.It is profoundly mistaken to believe any other statement is being made here, other than if one wants to regenerate an area, whether it be classified or otherwise, one should try to find a way of keeping the grotties out.  The Government has said that is the way to develop social integration.  One will not achieve social integration in an area if one has nobody there who is poor.  This works both ways.  One will then have schools in those areas which will not have anybody who is poor.  The same would be true for the health service and other services.  There will be delightful Irish versions of US gated cities.  We will not have the physical gate, we will have a financial one preventing people from living in a certain area because individuals on rent supplement are not welcome.I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this proposal and to think about what is being said.  It is written in technocratic language but what is actually being said is we do not want the poor here.

Neither the local authorities nor the Department report any issues whatsoever that have caused any difficulty.  I have great respect for Senator Ryan and I read what he stated on Second Stage.  I sincerely believe he is overstating this case.  I accept his heart is in the right place and I acknowledge the great work he has done to highlight social causes.  I have taken inspiration from some of the speeches he made.There is no hidden agenda.  This measure has been in operation since 2004.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern — who knows this area very well — stated in the other House when the Bill was debated, it does not stop anyone from living in the area.  Anyone who currently wants to live in Ballymun or any of these places can go on the waiting list for a local authority house.  He emphasised there will still be a couple of thousand local authority units in Ballymun, but no rent supplement can be taken in the new units that will be built.  He did not see the provision being there for eternity and stated it should and would be reviewed regularly but the area must be given a chance.  This is why I intervened to say I thought the opposite was the case.I do not know the area very well, but if one lets Ballymun continue in the way it was developing, it could have the opposite effect to what the Senators want to achieve, in that the only people living there would be people on rent supplement.  The Minister of State pointed out that the early private units were snapped up immediately by people on rent supplement before any change was made in the directive.  Do Senators wish the new Ballymun to consist 100% of people on rent supplement? There is nothing wrong with people on rent supplement.  It is not a matter of saying black or gay people cannot live in a certain place.  This deals with people in receipt of State funds and it is legitimate to use taxpayers' money to bring about a better result for a given area.I agree it is an arguable point and we could have a wonderful debate on it, though there was no such debate in 2004 when it was conceived.  However, the temperature has risen in the Houses lately and people are going out of their ways to receive insults.  Furthermore, the temperature will continue to rise in the next six weeks and any issue can fall foul of that, though that is not necessarily what is happening in this case.  It has been a long time since 2004 and there was no deep concern about it at the time.The choice is a Ballymun full of people on rent supplement, which is the way it was heading, or a Ballymun with thousands of local authority houses and some private buildings where non-recipients of rent supplement can get accommodation.  Which kind of Ballymun do Senators want?  I do not know the area but it seems to be a common sense approach.  I do not dress it up in a particular philosophy or plan for social engineering but it is a practical step in an area which needs to breathe again with a fresh start.  In the old Ballymun everybody was poor, a situation to which Senators have expressed their opposition.  We want a Ballymun where not everybody is in receipt of the same welfare payment, because that is not fair to them, nor to the taxpayer or to Ballymun.This provision will not necessarily be permanent, it will be heavily monitored and only applies to Ballymun at the moment.  It has not caused any trouble for two years and a new Ballymun is beginning to be built where people from different backgrounds and different income levels, rather than just welfare-dependants, will try to live together.  This is a brave attempt to give people a fresh start and to give people on rent supplement, many of whom are lone parents, the chance to integrate, as they do not all want to live in a block of apartments side by side.It is a difficult issue but the approach is based on a genuine attempt to give an area a fresh start.  I recall that, since it was initiated in 2004, the need to try something new in the area has been accepted across the board.  There was no avalanche of questions in the Dáil during Leaders' Questions and Opposition and Government alike saw the merits of the plan.  If the scheme makes life difficult for vulnerable people it will be stopped forthwith and a new policy adopted but at the moment the policy seems to be having a positive effect.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I have listened to the debate and to the Minister's comments and do not think we will gain anything by spending further time on the issue.  I do not agree with it and do not understand why we need to insert this provision in our legislation because local policies can deal with the problems involved.  We also live in different times from those we experienced 20 years ago, when unemployment was high and people were claiming rent supplement, or the equivalent, for long periods.  I would hope people in such a situation today would not remain so forever and would eventually be able to pay their rents once they gained employment.  As I said earlier on the question of lifting people out of poverty, there are other ways to regenerate areas and laws such as this are not necessary where local management plans operate effectively.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I do not want to stifle debate but I must try to progress the Bill.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	308	This issue would benefit from a long debate but I accept we must move on.  I will address a couple of matters the Minister mentioned.  I do not disagree with much of what he said because we have created disasters in the past and there is a great need to put them right.  Appallingly bad management decisions have been taken to demolish buildings, such as St. Michael's estate, which were perfect from a structural point of view and where the heating actually worked, unlike many other local authority housing schemes.  Some people were moving into local authority houses with a smaller floor space than the apartments they had in St. Michael's estate.  The solution is good planning.The Minister referred to people who were dependent on the State but such people exist because we live in a compassionate society which supports the vulnerable.  I do not like the idea of a special rule for certain people because, for example, old and retired people are dependent on the State, as are people in receipt of child benefit to pay for expenses such as child care.  People whose children go to a State primary school are dependent on the State, as are those who send their children to secondary school, even fee-paying schools.  If the case is valid for a regeneration area it is overwhelmingly so for schools.  Why should a school be full of people from rent supplement families?This policy was decided on because too many people in Ballymun were in receipt of rent supplement.  One solution would be to restrict the purchase of properties in the area to owner-occupiers.  It would probably reduce prices and increase the usefulness of the properties, as well as dramatically reducing the number of people on rent supplement.  If, however, we allow people who experience the joys of letting property with guaranteed rent supplement payments carte blanche to buy property in these areas we will get exactly what the Minister is trying to avoid.  Real regeneration involves permanently rooting young people in an area by allowing them to buy houses in order that they can become the backbone of the community.  This provision will mean people on slightly higher incomes will rent and pass through the area with no more, and possibly less, commitment to the community than people on rent allowance.  Populating the area with young people such as students attending DCU will not regenerate the community, notwithstanding the fact that it might regenerate the area.  Incidentally, I do not care whether my party said anything about this.  It has not been my style to be bothered by that.  If the party did not say anything, it is a pity but many things are missed and I almost missed this as well.  It is profoundly wrong.Would the Minister table a minor amendment to provide that this be reviewed and a report made to the Oireachtas in 12 months or two years?

I do not believe he will accept any amendments.

I am not sure what legislative section could be inserted in that regard.  A report on the progress of the legislation can be laid before the House at any stage.  I can repeat what I said earlier which is that it is fully intended that this would receive the closest scrutiny, measurement and monitoring.  I expect that reports on the monitoring of the scheme will be laid before both Houses regularly.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 46, to delete lines 28 and 29, and substitute the following:""(fa) to perform the functions conferred on the Board by this Act;(fb) give balanced and impartial information to consumers regarding pension products, including, not limited to—(i) tax relief,(ii) operators' charges,(iii) tax implications of leaving a sum of money in place, and(iv) the commutation of tax-free sums of money on point of retirement;".".The Minister will be very glad that I do not have much time left to speak on these amendments.  The purpose of amendment No. 11 is to ensure people taking out pensions would be given accurate and transparent information when doing so.  It is not good enough that the Government, the Pensions Board, the Financial Regulator and the industry, when advertising and promoting pensions, do not make clear to people the various aspects entailed in taking out a pension which ultimately may result in not having a very good pension.  The amendment outlines some of the areas in which we need greater transparency.  Advertisements often claim that participants will get 50% of their contributions back in tax relief.  However, it should be much clearer and be referred to as tax deferral.  Many people do not realise they will pay tax when drawing down their pensions.  It is tax deferral.  Perhaps we should consider a scheme in which one pays the tax at entry and draws it down free of tax in retirement.The operators' charges are not clear to people taking out pension plans, which they should be.  We have been told that charges could amount to anything up to 26% of a pension fund.  Most people do not know about that.  I feel very strongly that when taking out a pension, people should be informed about the implications of taking the tax-free lump sum on retirement.  People do not realise it would be more financially beneficial for them to leave in place the tax-free lump sum, thus providing them with an income stream during retirement.  If they really needed that lump sum, it would be cheaper for them to borrow it from a bank.  They could make the repayments out of their pensions and still have larger pensions than if they had first taken it out.  People are not informed of this.  I will not delay any further on this, but there is an onus on the Pensions Board, the Financial Regulator and the Minister to ensure people are given the information in order that they can make an informed decision and not be blinded by the industry convincing them to pay into a scheme where they will receive great tax-free allowances and which will give them wonderful pensions when they retire.  People must be informed of the possibility that this will not happen, that there may be no indexation, that a company may decide to change from a defined benefit to a defined contribution scheme.  All the pitfalls must be pointed out.  This has happened before and is still happening and people are not being informed about it.

It is essential that people are informed and given the full information in respect of pensions and their pitfalls.On Second Stage, my colleague, Senator Bradford, raised on my behalf the question of pre-1953 contributions and the need to take them fully into account in the calculation of pension entitlements.  It involves only a small number of people and the Minister of State said he would report back to us on this on Committee or Report Stage.  Perhaps, the Minister might comment on this as well.  When taking out pensions, it is essential people have full information.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	316	A number of issues, including the provision of information, have been raised.  The Pensions Board provides an extensive information service through the provision of a range of free information booklets on occupational pensions and through its website, www.pensionsboard.ie.  The pensions booklets and website cover a range of topics, such as pension options, what happens to a pension if one leaves the scheme and what happens when a pension scheme is wound up or mergers or acquisitions take place.  There is also a consumer guide to PRSAs and a pensions calculator to permit a person to calculate his or her future entitlements.The information available through the information service is continually updated and promoted as part of the board's ongoing pensions awareness campaign.  As the Senator is aware, the taxation issues are primarily a matter for the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Green Paper on pensions will be finalised shortly and will address issues relating to taxation, charges and commutation factors.Senator Terry was also concerned about the survey carried out by the Pensions Board.  The board is currently finalising a survey of occupational pension schemes with at least 1,000 active members seeking data on deferred members of these schemes.  On Friday, 30 March 2007, the Pensions Board will submit to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs the information about the 28 schemes which have responded to it in order that the committee will have the outcome of this survey.  The survey being finalised by the Pensions Board will indicate the number of deferred members who did not qualify for preservation of their pension rights.  This will provide the information necessary to estimate the cost of extending preservation to those deferred members.The survey was conducted in respect of 34 schemes with 1,000 or more active members.  To date, the board has received the information requested from 28 schemes and is confident it will receive the required information from the remaining six schemes.  The information requested as part of the survey included the number of deferred members with no entitlements to revaluation of benefits, the number of deferred members with entitlements to partial revaluation of benefits and details of any discretionary increase granted to deferred pensions.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I did not address amendment No. 12 when I was speaking.  I thank the Minister for his response and look forward to the results of the survey.The purpose of my amendment was to ensure the Pensions Board has the authority to compel companies to give this information.  I know the Minister said companies are complying with the request on a voluntary basis, but I can show him responses to letters I have written to the Pensions Board over a ten-year period requesting this same information.  The replies I received make fairytale reading.  Even at this stage, the Pensions Board has difficulty in securing this information because I was told in November that the information would be available in January.All I am trying to do is to strengthen the legislation to enable the Pensions Board to get from companies the information it requires, and the Minister should do likewise.  We change our laws to suit the pensions industry.  The amendment I am asking the Minister to accept is minor.  I strongly advise that he includes this amendment, at least on Report Stage tomorrow if he cannot do so today, because we know some companies may not answer the request from the Pensions Board, which is not good enough.  They should be compelled to do so.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Pensions Board has confirmed that it is receiving full co-operation with regard to the information it wants.  The board has very strong powers and there is no reason these powers cannot be strengthened.  At least two pieces of legislation from the Department, one of which is called the social welfare and pensions Bill, come through this House every year and there is a regular opportunity to increase the power of the Pensions Board in any area.  Such an opportunity is offered at least twice a year, if not on many more occasions in respect of other appropriate legislation.The Pensions Board is satisfied it is getting all the co-operation it needs.  Senator Terry should be able to study this information on Friday and I would be interested to hear what she and other Members of both Houses have to say about the information once it is produced.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Why has the Pensions Board not provided me with this information since 1995?  Why can it not answer the simple question about deferred members with frozen benefits?  It can only lead me to believe that there is some kind of cover-up, as I said yesterday.  Why must one become a Member of either House to try to get information from various Departments?  It is not good enough that a statutory body does not provide information to members of the public or to an elected Member.  We are making some progress in getting this delivered on Friday.  However, this information has been requested for more than ten years and has been either denied or those requesting it have been fobbed off in one way or another.  It is not good enough for one of our statutory bodies to behave in such a fashion.

I urge the Senator to study what it says.  I regret that she was unable to get the information earlier.  However, if they conducted the survey only last December, presumably the information was not readily available to them in advance of that work.  Perhaps that was the reason they were not able to respond to the Senator.  I doubt if there is any hidden agenda or cover-up.  The Pensions Board is continually getting extra powers and we are building up its resources and clout.  We will continue to provide statutory back-up because it must act on behalf of consumers to protect them.  That is an essential part of its work.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I move:That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to develop and implement an ethical foreign policy.I find it interesting that the Government has amended this motion in a manner that goes right to the nub of the issue.  It is clear that in bypassing any mention of ethics, the Government acknowledges its guilt in this area and it is notable that there is no Minister from the Department of Foreign Affairs to hear this motion.  The reference to the values of the people is a calculated insult of the type delivered by the late Mr. Charles Haughey when he announced his equivocal half-measure on contraception, describing it as an Irish solution for an Irish people.In requesting the Government to develop and implement an ethical foreign policy, I recognise that I am asking for a lot.  Despite some gestures in this regard, notably by Mr. Robin Cook in Britain which fizzled out after the discovery of the export of Hawk aircraft to Indonesia for use in the military oppression of the people of East Timor and a few fitful outbreaks of conscience in our Department of Foreign Affairs under the leadership of Mr. Frank Aiken, Mr. Dick Spring and Mr. David Andrews, such a policy has nowhere been given a substantial trial.  This is because, owing to the weakness of human motivation, perceived self-interest almost invariably conquers and it is frequently expressed in economic terms.Finance plays a major role in this matter and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, indicated at a meeting I arranged with the Darfur investment group that it is the Government's intention to direct agencies such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund to ensure investments on behalf of the State are ethical.  This area will be addressed more fully by my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan.Genuine altruism is rare, even in individuals, and levels of cynicism seem to exist in direct relationship with political seniority and closeness to our possession of power.  The higher one goes, the fewer the principles.  The historian, Edward Gibbon, said the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was almost unique among rulers in that his overriding concern was not self-advancement but the welfare of his people.  This ideal must, in the 21st century, be extended from a national or imperial base to a global one.  I am asking that Ireland, as a country, follow the example of the noble Roman.At this point in the discussion I am usually reminded by people on the other side of realpolitik and national self-interest, so let me repeat a story I have told on a number of occasions in this House.  When the then Government proposed to sell beef to the army of Saddam Hussein, I was one of a limited number of people in political life who opposed the transaction.  For my pains I was lectured from across the House by the Government spokesman on foreign affairs who said that, while what I was suggesting might be the moral thing to do, could Ireland afford it?  Within a short space of time there was an outbreak of war in the region, financial arrangements collapsed, Saddam Hussein welshed on the deal and the Irish taxpayer was burdened not only with the £100 million owed by the Iraqi regime for the beef but was also awarded the privilege of paying hefty sums to that very pragmatic cattle dealer, Mr. Larry Goodman.  We, therefore, did the immoral thing and paid through the nose for it.  My point is that although there may appear to be economic inconvenience in the short to medium term, in the long term decency and moral standards pay off.  As the Bible states: “Cast your bread upon the waters and it shall return to you an hundred fold.”Let us stay with Iraq for a while and witness the unholy contortions of the Government in maintaining a morally bankrupt policy of subservience to the criminal Administration of George Bush, no matter whither it leads.  When 100,000 people marched in the streets of Dublin against the war, the Taoiseach claimed they were agreeing with him.  This may be open to doubt but it is surely incontrovertible that the overwhelming mass of Irish people wish to disassociate themselves from the way in which the Taoiseach, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Government have connived in the deliberate employment of torture as an instrument of policy by the US Administration.  The two Aherns, Bertie and Dermot, claim that Condoleezza Rice gave them a clear assurance in the matter of torture.  While this may be the case, she did not provide the assurance Bertie and Dermot passed on to the Irish people.  She clearly indicated that the US Administration was committed to the use of torture and openly acknowledged that even at Guantanamo Bay, a place whose exact location and function we at least know, unlike the unspecified torture sites in eastern Europe, procedures include hooding, sleep deprivation and the use of white noise.The Taoiseach's memory is selective but even he can hardly have forgotten that our Government successfully sued the United Kingdom Government when it engaged in these practices at Castlereagh police station in the North and won a judgment which made it perfectly clear that in the view of the European Court of Human Rights, a view our Government enthusiastically accepted at the time, these practices constituted torture.  When Condoleezza Rice told our Government that hooding, white noise and sleep deprivation were employed in Guantanamo Bay, she was clearly admitting the use of torture.  Moreover, the commitment to torture of Bush and his cronies was made perfectly explicit in the morally disgraceful and ethically unjustifiable attempts made to force a measure through Congress facilitating and legalising torture, including methods not seen since the Gestapo left the Avenue Foch.Neither was our collaboration merely verbal given that we actively collaborated with the use of Shannon Airport for the purpose of extraordinary rendition, a foul practice in which civilians are kidnapped, bundled into aeroplanes, drugged, shackled and delivered to countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Syria where torture is routinely practised in a manner that has occasionally led to hypocritical protests from both Britain and the United States.  This practice is carried out secretly.  However, in recent years, using information concerning aeroplane registration, flight patterns, etc., supplied to me by gallant people at Shannon Airport such as Ed Horgan and Tim Hourigan, I have sought to make these matters public through debate in the House and by other means.All these matters were a by-product of George W. Bush's military adventure in the Middle East.  The war in Iraq was fought clearly for logistical and economic advantage, especially in the interests of multinational corporations such as Bechtel and Halliburton with which the eminence grise of the American Administration, Dick Cheney, has close and very unhealthy ties.  This has happened before.What was novel, however, about the Bush Administration's ill-advised and barbarous attack was not only its hypocrisy but also that it came as part of a package which included the deliberate undermining of international humanitarian protection such as the Geneva Convention and the institution of the United Nations.  Led by the extreme right, the United States Government deliberately corrupted every standard of decency and legality for which the West has stood. Habeas corpus flies out the window and instead of flinging back in their faces the lies propounded by the stumbling and inadequate Bush and his sidekick, the unspeakable automaton, Ms Condoleezza Rice, the Aherns, Bertie and Dermot, grovellingly accept every humiliating fiction they are fed with the alacrity one would expect of a flea-ridden poodle with piles accepting a rubber cushion from the hands of its master.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I will use their titles but all the other language I have used when referring to them stands.Through all of this, the corruption of language is a significant and telling factor.  In a revealing moment the Lady Macbeth of the Middle East, Condoleezza Rice, described the horrendous bloodbath that followed the Israeli assault upon Lebanon as "the birth pangs of a new democracy".  As I indicated, under the Bush Administration the West has descended to values not seen since Adolf Hitler, but people are afraid to squeak.  Even under Hitler, however, brave individuals were doing important work.  I think, in particular, of the late Victor Klemperer, a cousin of the great and distinguished conductor, Otto Klemperer.  He used his time in seclusion during the Nazi tyranny to compile an academic analysis of the linguistic system employed by the Third Reich.Language is important and I invite Senators to examine for a moment some of the language employed.  "Shock and awe", the description of the initial barrage of bombing against the civilian population of Baghdad, could easily be translated as "Blitzkrieg".  "Shake and bake" is the euphemism used to conceal the illegal use of white phosphorus against personnel by the United States Army in Falluja.  "Extraordinary rendition" is another euphemism employed to cover the nasty reality of kidnap and torture.We need a Victor Klemperer in our universities to conduct an analysis of the way in which the Bush Administration has abused language to perpetuate tyranny.  I hope this may be done and believe it will be, for although it has taken a long time, there are signs that a corrective is being applied, even within the American system.  Seventy per cent of the American people are now against the war, making it clear that those of us who consistently opposed the war and were accused of anti-Americanism for our pains were the most pro-American of all.In response to allegations about Ireland's involvement in extraordinary rendition, the Government has consistently obfuscated and lied.  In the two reports produced and adopted on this issue, one by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the second by the European Parliament, the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not answer clear questions which were put to him.  Instead, as he had done in this House and consistently to the press, he insisted upon answering questions he had not been asked.I defy any person to point to one instance where I or any of the others leading the charge in this matter claimed that torture victims were transported through Shannon Airport on their way to torture centres, yet this is what the Minister consistently denies.  Why does he deny something which has not been said?  The reason is that he cannot answer the charges made and the charge I and others have made, namely, that the fact this country collaborated with the United States by assisting aeroplanes on the return leg of their villainous and shameful journey is incontrovertibly true.The torture circuit is an unbroken line in which Ireland has played a mean, cowardly and disgusting role.  To give one example, on 17 February 2003, an Egyptian citizen who had been granted asylum in Italy, Abu Omar, was violently abducted in broad daylight in the Via Guerzoni in Milan.  The incident was witnessed by various civilians, including a woman called Rezk Merfat who saw the terrified Abu Omar being jumped on, struggling and crying for help and being forced into a van.  Abu Omar was then taken to the American airbase at Aviano where he was flown a short distance, put into another aeroplane with United States markings which delivered him to Cairo.  This, according to legal documents, is what happened to him:The first measure was to leave him in a room where incredibly loud and unbearable noise was made ... he has experienced damage to his hearing.  The second kind of torture was to place him in a sauna at tremendous temperature and straight afterwards to put him in a cold store room . . . occasioning terrible pain to his bones . . . as if they were cracking.  The third was to hang him upside down . . . and apply live wires to give electric shocks to sensitive parts of the body including his genitals.  He has suffered damage to his motory and urinary systems . . . he became incontinent.He was tortured for a further seven months and has never been charged with any offence.  However, on the return journey to the United States from Cairo, as part of the torture circuit, on the following day, 18 February, the Gulfstream jet stopped off to be refuelled at Shannon Airport.  No protest has ever been made at this gross violation of international and Irish law by a so-called friendly government.  This has all been done because of the Irish Government's gutlessness in the face of American capital.I have mentioned the late Frank Aiken.  How horrified he would be at the queasy way in which we have attempted, without recourse to either the sovereign Parliament of Ireland or the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to shift our firm position that Tibet was a separate and sovereign country.  We have also said little about organ harvesting, an appalling practice about which my colleague, Senator O'Toole, will speak.  Again, money is the reason for these developments.Let us examine the situation in the Middle East.  There has been a systematic violation by the Israeli Government of the most basic human rights of the Palestinian people.  We know full well that in the external association agreement between the European Union and the state of Israel, there are attached to this treaty important human rights clauses.  However, we have done nothing to assert these clauses and even my modest proposal that the Government should support the establishment of a monitoring group to oversee the human rights situation in the occupied territories has not been pursued by the Government.  Once more, United States pressure, the influence of American money and the perceived threat to jobs financed here by US multinationals has, I suspect, played its role.  In the past various Government's have taken up decent and moral positions on certain issues.  However, sadly, on most occasions it has had to be shamed into this by the action of courageous individuals such as the Dunnes Stores strikers and Tom Hyland, whose heroic defence of the people of East Timor is well known to this House.  I admired the staunchness of the late Mr. Haughey when he refused to support Margaret Thatcher in herFalklands War adventure.What we need is an understanding of the position announced by the former Senator and President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, in her work on ethical globalisation.  We need to understand that this small and fragile planet is threatened not just environmentally but politically by the pursuit of narrow selfish and sectional interest and the failure to date of any major state to attempt to establish an ethical foreign policy.  Sadly, the Government has in its amendment made it clear it has no intention of supporting these standards.

After his tour de force, I am not sure I can add much.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House.The point of the motion, in discussing it with Senator Norris some weeks back, was precisely to achieve what is outlined in the Government amendment, namely, to have "a foreign policy based on the values of the Irish people".  That is our motivation.  It is appalling the Government should choose to amend an acceptable motion which should have been an opportunity to find a consensual approach to foreign policy.Why do I suggest we should have a foreign policy based on the values of the Irish people?  I will begin my argument with regard to the situation in Guantanamo Bay.  What do I think of when I consider the issue of people being imprisoned for four or five years without charge, trial or support?  I think of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six and of the values of the Irish people, who were horrified by people being imprisoned unjustly.  They spoke out, took a stand and said what they had to say.  The opposition to Guantanamo is surely the same as the support for the Birmingham Six or the Guildford Four.  It is an opposition to imprisonment without trial.  It is the same view the Irish people took with regard to internment in the North.  Guantanamo is internment in a different climate and place.I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House and thank him for making time available to be present.  I was making the point that the motion is closest to the values of the Irish people.  As the Minister is a young man, I do not know if he will remember 1959, when the Irish people saw the images of the Dalai Lama being forced down a mountain in Tibet.  It tugged at the heartstrings of a nation.  The situation is still the same.  These are the values of the Irish people.  This is why people such as myself, Senator Norris and many others have over the years felt a sense of support for the people of Tibet, who were illegally colonised.  Their culture, society and religion were overrun and their religious leader was taken prisoner by the Chinese people.

What is certain is that none were ever found so the balance of evidence has to be that they never existed.  We can consider the fact an invasion took place against the wishes of the United Nations and against its policy but where does this leave us in terms of the Government's motion with regard to the values of the Irish people?  Some 100,000 Irish people marched in opposition to the invasion.  In seeking to have an ethical foreign policy, surely those of us who questioned what happened at the time of the invasion are closer to the values of the Irish people referred to in the Government amendment.  I hope the Minister will accept this point.Every returned Irish aid worker shares a view with regard to Irish aid to foreign countries.  Many have a horror of propping up illegitimate, illegal and degraded Governments in parts of Africa.  When I say this, I am not necessarily implying the Government takes the opposite side in every one of the cases mentioned — it does not — but it has done so in some cases.  I go along with the point made by Senator Norris with regard to the Falklands and the Middle East, where I would have been very much in tune with the Government position.  This question goes back well beyond our time.  The values of the Irish people were not represented when de Valera went to sign the book of condolences on the death of Hitler.  What we are trying to achieve is a way to have an ethical foreign policy.I am sorry I will not be present to listen to the Minister explain why he objects to a motion which asks us to implement an ethical foreign policy.  It is as if he is taking a position that he is not in favour of an ethical foreign policy.

Why, therefore, could he not go the whole way and support the motion?The Irish people, in their reaction to what they saw, heard and read about East Timor, made their views effectively known at all levels.  Senators Ryan and Norris and I raised the issue on many occasions.  What we are trying to achieve now is what we were trying to achieve then in raising those issues.I wrote to the Minister recently with regard to the major trips to China and all the brouhaha that goes with them.  I asked whether what happens in China should matter and whether we should raise issues there.  I am a pragmatist but there are times when one must raise issues.I asked to meet the Chinese Vice Premier when he visited Ireland recently on the issue of the Falun Gong, or Falun Dafa, although he found himself too busy to meet.  The Falun Gong is a harmless group which is not revolutionary and is not trying to undermine the authority.  Its members are harmless.  They have a set of beliefs on good living to which nobody could object.  However, as they dared to question the totalitarian regime of the Chinese Communist Party they have been imprisoned, brutalised repeatedly and forcibly made the victims of live organ harvesting.  I have seen and heard the evidence of situations where it was possible to telephone to order a kidney, heart or liver and it would be delivered on the day as required.  This is happening in China today.These are the questions I would like us to raise.  We recognise that China is a big market, and a future market for Ireland, but we should also recognise that we must take a stand against these practices.  It is countries like ours — small countries without vested interests — which can make the difference on these issues.  This is why I take great pleasure in seconding the motion.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment and accede to the motion as proposed by Senator Norris and seconded by myself.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I thank Senator Mooney for moving the amendment and for allowing me to intervene at this point.  I apologise because I have an engagement later and must leave the debate early.I welcome the opportunity to set out the principles that underlie our foreign policy.  I have no grave objection to the motion as set out, but when I discussed the issue with my officials I and they felt that, as set down, the motion was somewhat bland and bald.  I felt that including the words "a foreign policy based on the values of the Irish people which also protects and promotes Irish national interests" better reflected what our foreign policy is about.  I believe any objective judge of our policy would affirm that in its conception and execution our policy is an ethical one, based firmly on the values of the Irish people and serving their interests.Ethics is a system of moral principles which deals with judgments as to what constitutes good and bad conduct.  However, one must also distinguish between intentions and outcomes.  I make this point because having good intentions is not enough.  We live in the real world and must, to the best of our ability, try to anticipate the outcome of our actions.  Are we likely to make things better or worse or how do we maximise the chances of our good intentions having the desired effect?Posing such questions does not mean surrendering to what is called the realist school of foreign policy, where simple, narrow self-interest dictates a state's actions.  Far from it.  However, it is to say that an ethical foreign policy is best advanced by an awareness of the environment in which we operate.I believe Ireland has been successful in utilising its knowledge of the international system and has the ability to operate in the multilateral context to advance our principles and values.  What are those principles and values?  Foreign policy, like all our national policies, is based on the foundation laid out in Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Article 5 defines what Ireland is, namely, a sovereign, independent, democratic state.  Article 29, on Ireland's international relations, sets out the principles guiding our relations with other states.  There we affirm our devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality.  We affirm our adherence to the resolution of disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination and accept the principles of international law in the conduct of relations between states.  Aside from its articulation of the principles underlying relations between states, Bunreacht na hÉireann affirms in Article 40 a series of rights that pertain to the individual, which it terms personal rights.  Today, we would call them human rights.Since 1937, a body of international law on human rights has developed here and Ireland has striven to ensure its universal application.  Alongside support for the United Nations and international law, successive Governments have pursued a policy of military neutrality.  The State has chosen not to enter into military alliances or a mutual defence pact with other countries. The amendment of the Constitution in 2002 to allow for the ratification of the Nice treaty precludes Ireland joining any EU common defence unless the people decide otherwise.Every dispatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces abroad — whether UN, EU or NATO-led — is a sovereign decision of the Government and is subject to the requirements of the so-called triple-lock of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation.The origins of our policy of military neutrality lie in our history as a State and in the particular circumstances of partition and have evolved as a key feature of our foreign relations.  This policy has acquired particular value for the people as an expression of our ethical views on the use of military forces — that the deployment of military forces should be undertaken only within the framework of the UN Charter and with the approval of the United Nations.That Ireland should articulate these principles and rights in our Constitution and legislation is no surprise given our history.  As a small nation that fought against a larger one for its freedom, we value the principles of democracy, the rule of international law, collective security and the universal application of human rights.  We also recognise that a world which as far as possible is organised on these lines is in the interests of small countries in particular.The expression of these principles and values, or ethics, can take place only within a multilateral framework.  That framework is provided by the United Nations.  Ireland fully and profoundly supports the principles and values set out in the United Nations Charter.  While I was honoured to act as one of the Secretary General's envoys in support of the UN reform process, I fully appreciate that being asked to undertake this role reflected the high standing of Ireland at the UN over many years and under many Governments.  Acting within the parameters set out in the charter assures us of the ethical intent of the military actions undertaken on behalf of the international community by the United Nations.  Ireland's long-standing support for UN peacekeeping is one of the most tangible expressions of our principles and values in foreign relations.Since our first UN peacekeeping mission in 1958, our troops have performed more than 55,000 tours of duty on some 60 UN peace support operations worldwide.  Defence Forces personnel have served throughout the world, notably in the Middle East, Africa, the former Yugoslavia and East Timor.   Irish lives, unfortunately, have been lost in this service.  To date, 85 members of the Defence Forces have given their lives in the cause of world peace.The United Nations is not the only multilateral framework available as a means for Ireland to give expression to its principles and ideals.  As a founder member of the Council of Europe, Ireland has consistently supported and encouraged its activities to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  We attach particular importance to the promotion of human rights.  The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms remains the essential reference point for the protection of human rights in Ireland and Europe as a whole.  Ireland was also a founder member of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and is a keen supporter of its programmes on arms control, preventive diplomacy, human rights and election monitoring.The European Union has also provided us with a platform to shape the international environment through the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The essential objectives of the CFSP very much reflect Ireland's values.  Europe has learned from its own history the bitter lessons of conflict and mutual aggression and in its approach to the wider world seeks to use its weight in a constructive and peaceful way.  While, naturally, decision-making in the CFSP involves compromise, I am absolutely satisfied that we have a much greater capacity to influence events within the Union than outside it and that our influence serves to mould an honourable and essentially ethical policy.A key example of how we have utilised the multilateral framework in pursuit of the common good is our engagement with the issue of nuclear weapons.  Ireland has sought to address this global challenge since we first joined the United Nations in the 1950s.  Frank Aiken, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, introduced a resolution in the UN General Assembly that eventually led to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, a decade later.  It has become the most universal of all international instruments in the disarmament and non-proliferation area and remains the framework for further progress on this issue.  Article 6 of the treaty contains the only multilateral legally binding commitment to nuclear disarmament from the nuclear weapon states.  Ireland is in the vanguard of efforts to reinvigorate the NPT.  I was gratified that the new Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon, has also highlighted the importance of addressing the issue of weapons of mass destruction as a continuing threat to world peace and security.We have taken a similarly vigorous approach to the codification and implementation of human rights norms.  We believe profoundly in their universality and they are central to our foreign policy.  Ireland has ratified the six core United Nations human rights conventions and regularly submits reports to the United Nations human rights mechanisms on the measures undertaken to implement these conventions.  Later this week, in New York, Ireland will sign up to the two most recently adopted United Nations instruments, the UN Convention on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearances and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Ireland played an active role in the negotiations leading to these conventions and fully supported their adoption, which represents a further strengthening of the international human rights framework.Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for human rights violations.  Some have suggested that the Government has not met its own standards of human rights in respect of allegations of extraordinary rendition through Ireland.  These allegations have no basis in fact.

The UN Human Rights Council held a special session in December 2006 to consider the urgent human rights situation there.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, was instrumental in calling for this special session.  Sudan subsequently refused admission to the council's high level mission and this refusal is being considered at the current session of the council.  Most recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, highlighted the situation in Darfur in his speech to the 4th session of the council.Ireland has also been to the fore in responding to the deeply worrying events in Zimbabwe.  The arrest again today of opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is a cause for alarm.  Given his treatment at the hands of the authorities earlier this month, we must be concerned about his human rights and his physical safety.  I join my EU colleagues in holding the Government of Zimbabwe responsible for his safety.  On behalf of the Irish Government, I call for his immediate and unconditional release and that of his colleagues.Our concerns about his arrest, however, do not stop there.  His arrest and the actions of the authorities raise fundamental questions about President Mugabe's respect for basic democratic norms, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	374	It is driven by our belief that the international community must respond to humanitarian crises and political oppression and that in doing so, we must invoke the universal standards of human rights.  We must point to their grievous absence and measure progress by their application and enforcement.Aside from peacekeeping, perhaps the most tangible example of the ethical basis of our approach to foreign relations is our commitment to overseas development aid, ODA.  Irish Aid, with its focus on Africa and poverty reduction, is an expression of the values and interest of the Irish people in helping the world's poor.  By 2009, our aid is likely to reach €1 billion.  In 2012, Ireland will reach the UN ODA target of 0.7% of gross national income, GNI.  This year, spending will exceed 0.5% of GNI, putting us in the vanguard of donors.We spend this money because, as the Taoiseach writes in the foreword to the White Paper on Irish Aid:Ireland can rightly claim to empathise with those who are suffering from disease, poverty and hunger every day around the globe.  But empathy is not enough.  Our actions must speak louder than our words ... Our aid programme is a practical expression of the values that help define what it means to be Irish at the beginning of the 21st Century.As our aid programme illustrates, the values that inform and motivate our foreign policy are not static.  Although based on firm foundations, they are dynamic and evolving, responding to the changing circumstances of our world.  The establishment of the rapid response initiative is another example of this dynamism.  The initiative aims to improve and enhance Ireland's ability to respond to humanitarian disasters.  Similarly, the creation of the conflict resolution unit will allow Ireland to play a more active role in international conflict prevention and resolution, building on and utilising the very substantial success of the Northern Ireland peace process.In the context of our expanding aid programme, both initiatives will improve our capacity to become a model United Nations member.  In conception and operation then, as I have outlined in this House, I believe that Ireland's foreign policy is ethical by the high standards and ideals we have set ourselves and by the engagements and actions we have undertaken within the multilateral framework of the United Nations and Europe.Through our commitments and actions we have successfully sought to give expression to the values and interests of the Irish people.  This Government has built on the endeavours of previous Governments and earlier generations to ensure Ireland can not only maintain its place with pride among the nations of the world but also shape that world in the name of universal values and the common good.

In terms of philosophical reflection, one would not disagree with a word the Minister has said.  He, however, said that one does not determine what is ethical on the basis of philosophical reflection but on outcomes.  I am entitled to ask for evidence of outcomes.  He continues to obfuscate on the question of extraordinary rendition.  I did not suggest, nor have I ever heard Senator Norris suggest, that we had any evidence these unfortunate prisoners passed through Shannon Airport.  We said that the deliberate policy of the Government was to facilitate the aircraft used to do this.

It is nonsense to suggest that facilitating the refuelling of planes that were used to transport people to regimes where they would be tortured is part of an ethical foreign policy.  The Minister blinked because he did not want to say something.  The Government says the lady gave it an assurance.  The lady has told lies about US policy on extraordinary rendition.  She said it did not do it.  Apparently she tells yarns and fibs in public but when she meets our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Taoiseach, she discovers a new self and tells the truth and the Government says it believes her.  The evidence is that she does not tell the truth.  On the question of whether we tolerated airplanes that were involved in this disgusting practice going through one of our airports , the answer is, "Yes, we did."

However, the Government adopted a position that was defensible, albeit different from mine, and did not deny there was a problem.  When a US President visited this country, the Government, led by Garret Fitzgerald and including Peter Barry, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, publicly made known what it felt was wrong with US policy on Central America.The present Government, however, backed off, chickened out and is now compromised irreparably by the deaths of 650,000 people.  According to information presented on the BBC website in recent days, the British Government's advisers now accept that The Lancet estimate of the number of deaths in Iraq was based on sound methodology, even though they will not say it is true.  Some 650,000 innocent civilians are dead and our Government said it would blink while this occurred.  By God, did it blink in a big way.  It is suffering the consequences of this ever since.Let me return to the Minister's fine philosophical phrases, with which I said I agree.  We are very concerned about the arms race, for instance.  Other countries, including Norway, are also concerned.  Norway has a large investment reserve, assembled on foot of its having North Sea oil.  Being the wise, social-democratic country that it is, it decided not to splurge the reserve on crazy projects but to establish a fund for the long-term future of its economy.  This is the petroleum fund and amounts to €75 billion, give or take €10 billion.  The fund must be invested according to ethical principles acceptable to the people of Norway.  The fund administrators have divested themselves from Wal-Mart, for instance, because they felt its labour practices were wrong, and they refused to invest in Honeywell because they believed it had a direct connection with the nuclear weapons industry, as opposed to the nuclear power industry.  They have done this consistently and successfully and are becoming a force.We have the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is perhaps close to €10 billion in value.  We have tried over and again to get the managers of that fund to accept similar ethical principles to the Norwegians but they have refused over and again.  The Norwegian fund is growing and profitable but we will not follow suit because, when it comes to a choice between ethics and money, we will always choose money.  The silly joke that the present Government believes "ethics" is a county in England is probably a bit too harsh but it has a certain amount of truth.The rhetoric is wonderful but if one scratches one level below the surface, one will note that the Government will do nothing about ethical investments.  It took us years to introduce the Control of Exports Bill, which will only have an inhibitory effect.  The European Union has a stated objective of becoming a major player in the world armaments industry.  This industry is responsible for the death of far more innocent civilians than the drugs industry.  This is a fact and there is no arguing with it.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I appreciate that.The arms industry kills more than the drugs industry, yet we refuse to take the necessary steps to address this.  There are at least 100 million small arms floating around the Great Lakes area, most of which were made either in the United States or Europe.  The arms industry is the core determinant of what is ethical.  Making money out of other people's conflicts is probably the most unethical thing one can do.  Now that we are rich and in a position to take on board ethical considerations, we have backed away from doing so.I could elaborate on other ethical issues.  Europe is in the disgraceful position of being softer on Burma than the United State because France and Britain do not want to upset their precious investments in Burma.   We could refer to Zimbabwe, regarding which the Minister was correctly concerned about the locking up of the Opposition leader in Zimbabwe.  We could refer to Palestine also.  There are between 20 and 40 Members of the Palestinian Parliament in jail in Israel but nobody talks about this.We could talk about Guantanamo Bay and the fact that the civilian lawyer of the first prisoner who pleaded guilty, who has now gone to Australia, refused to serve in the show trial in Guantanamo because he was asked to agree in advance to be bound by rules that had not yet been written.  We have tied ourselves to a country that believes in brutal warfare, which has suppressed human rights at home and which is now determined to go through a series of show trials in Guantanamo that will be even less public and accountable than the sorts of practices carried out in the Soviet Union at the height of Stalinism.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I congratulate him belatedly on his recent promotion and the good job he is doing in his brief.Questions on foreign policy agendas and how Governments should react in international relations have become increasingly significant in recent decades, particularly the last decade, as international relations have become more complex and in the wake of the creation of new states, particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the development of the African nations.  These questions concern the promotion of human rights, the punishment of crimes against humanity, the prohibition of arms sales to unstable regions or states that abuse human rights, and the use of force, particularly for the purpose of humanitarian intervention.  These are all important issues.As a small country with a history of colonial domination, Ireland has carved out an important niche for itself as a country which not only subscribes to the values outlined by the Minister in his speech, but has achieved an enviable international reputation especially among former colonial countries and throughout the Third World.  Our election to the United Nations Security Council in this millennium is but one example of this phenomenon.  It is a testament to our image as a country which is a champion of human rights and one that is automatically called upon to provide peacekeeping forces in some of the most complex conflicts in the world going back as far as the Congo.Ireland was particularly keen to become a member of the United Nations from its inception but, historically, due to the somewhat elitist nature of the founding countries and those that joined in San Francisco in 1945.  Ireland, along with many other small countries, had to wait ten years before it was given an opportunity to sit as a sovereign, independent State in the United Nations.  When we did, we hit the ground running.  We lost no time in making it clear we were bringing to the United Nations an approach to world issues that was determined, not by alliances, but by our own values and historical experiences.Prior to our membership of the United Nations, we had also become a founding member of the Council of Europe.  To this day, we remain active participants in that internationally recognised and esteemed human rights parliamentary assembly.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Ormonde who, like myself, has the honour of representing, not only this House — with Senator Bradford who has long been a member of the Council of Europe — and other distinguished Members of this House and the other House, but this country in this important human rights body.  Sadly, sometimes it is confused with the European Parliament, primarily because we both sit in Strasbourg.  I am not sure about my colleagues but I constantly have to clarify to people that the Council of Europe is not the European Parliament.Once we became a member of the United Nations, we became dedicated to the reduction of international tensions and, in particular, to arms control; our efforts bore fruit eventually in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  This achievement is often touted around.  It reminds me a little of our lack of footballing success in County Leitrim.  When I was a child, whenever we talked about the major footballing achievement of County Leitrim, we always referred to the 1927 Connacht final, which was our first ever Connacht title.  It took us until 1994 before we added another provincial title.  This generation and the next one will probably be talking about 1994 in the same way as we referred to 1927.  Bearing in mind that we were a new member of the United Nations, one has to accept that Frank Aiken's initiative at that time was an enormous contribution towards world peace.  As the Minister pointed out, Article 6 of the UN Charter contains the only multilateral legally binding commitment from the nuclear weapons states to nuclear disarmament.Ireland was not long a member of the UN when we answered the call to send military observers into the Middle East and a Defence Forces contingent into the Congo.  The sad legacy of that conflict resonates even to this day.  Investigations are ongoing into the return of one of the tragic fatalities of the Defence Forces in that country.  Since then, members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána have served under the UN flag across the globe.  Nothing embodies Ireland's commitment to the United Nations more tangibly, and nothing has brought greater honour to this State than the service and sacrifice of the Irish men and women who have worn the light blue beret with such distinction.A modern historian has concluded that Ireland's independent role at the United Nations in that era from the 1950s on was, "planned far in advance, thoroughly reviewed by Irish diplomats, professionally implemented and ardently defended".  That still remains the case today.  I pay compliment to the skills of our diplomats in all the international fora in which Ireland is represented.The Minister has highlighted Ireland's contribution to overseas aid.  It is making a real difference to the lives of many thousands of people every day.  Meeting the needs of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people is one of the great challenges of our time.  There is a moral imperative to act and Ireland has a proud record in that regard.  I am convinced that, notwithstanding the criticisms that legitimately or otherwise can be levelled at Irish foreign policy, if one were to ask the vast majority of people how they feel about our foreign policy, they would point immediately to overseas aid and UN peacekeeping as two positive and tangible examples of, not only Ireland's sovereignty but also of the esteem in which we are held internationally.I referred earlier to Members of this House and others who are members of international bodies.  I am sure colleagues would identify with my experience on the Council of Europe.  As an Irish parliamentarian I regularly feel proud of the image and perception of Ireland that is held by international parliamentarians from countries in Europe and beyond.  They have a positive image of our foreign policy and the way in which we go about our business.  It is a noble cause on which we are embarked.  There are many instances of Ireland's intervention to help those less well off, the vulnerable, the needy and those suffering human rights abuses.  These have all been catalogued by the Minister, even down to the present day where he is again taking a strong, independent position in criticising the Mugabe regime.  I compliment Senator Ross for raising the matter on the Adjournment of the House last night.  It is vital we continue to do that.Reference was made to Burma.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, represented this country at the recent ASEAN conference in south east Asia.  Not only did he put forward the Irish position on the untenable nature of the Burma regime and the continuing captivity of Aung San Suu Kyi, but I know from speaking to him that he was involved in a one-to-one dialogue with the Myanmar Foreign Minister.  In diplomatic terms, it could be said that an interesting exchange of views was made.  I can assure the House the Minister of State was robust in putting forward the Irish position on the unacceptable nature of that regime.  From my personal experience of talking to Ministers for Foreign Affairs and to Ministers of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs, whenever it has been necessary to assert the Irish position on human rights violations that have taken place, or where there are rogue regimes, Ireland has been to the fore in that regard.I realise I have very little time left.  There are many other areas to which I would wish to refer.  I put on record the Government's continuing support for the UN, through the establishment of the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission and the fact Ireland has now set up a conflict resolution initiative in this country, which is a legacy of our peace process, an issue we have already debated in this House following the historic events in Belfast earlier this week.Ireland's commitment to Africa is internationally recognised and appreciated, not only within Africa itself but by the international community.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a robust position on Darfur.  He has criticised the Sudanese Government for its lack of humanity and for refusing to allow a UN multilateral force into that sad country.  I have already made brief reference to Myanmar.Ireland, through the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan, was the first European country to commit to the establishment of a Palestinian state when it was not the most popular thing to do.  Where I diverge from my colleagues on the other side of the House is that if this debate were to do nothing else, it would at least put forward the positive aspects of Irish foreign policy.  This country traditionally does not do war, due to its small size, the fact we are not a military power, and that we were a former colonial dominated country, but we do peace and we do it very well.  We do human rights, and we do it very well.  I applaud those at all levels within the Irish diplomatic service and at a political level in the Department of Foreign Affairs for the continuing success of that twin policy that has established Ireland's role.  To quote that often used cliché, we continue to punch above our weight.  For a country of 4 million people on the periphery of Europe, the international prestige we have achieved through hard work is extraordinary.  The countries we are now helping recognise that Ireland's colonial legacy has put us in a central position to understand and empathise with the problems that are occurring internationally.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I support the motion.  If we had a plebiscite system and this request was put before the people for commendation it would be approved because every citizen would want our country to develop and implement an ethical foreign policy.  When I read the wording of the motion I wondered if the Government would dare oppose the proposal by coming up with a ham-fisted amendment.  Once again, it did not surprise me and produced the amendment on which the Minister spoke.  It is disappointing that there is not unanimous support for the motion from our Independent colleagues because it would clearly represent the way the Irish people would wish our foreign policy to be implemented.In defence of his amendment the Minister spoke about good intentions not being enough.  He said we live in the real world and must try, to the best of our ability, to anticipate the outcome of our actions.  What can we do in the various fora where we can play leading roles?  We are now an established part of the European Union and at a time when new countries are joining the EU, Ireland can play a leading role but have we played our role in Europe to the maximum degree from a foreign policy perspective?  We could make more progress on a number of areas including the Darfur question, Zimbabwe and Burma.  Using our role in the European Union we should attempt to force greater European action to resolve those problems.The problems in Darfur, which I have raised here on a number of occasions, continue to shock.  They do not make front page headlines or the television coverage they deserves but the situation there is shocking and the European Union could and should be doing much more to demand and help implement a solution.  Our Government should take a stronger line in that regard at European level.Regarding Zimbabwe, most Members of the House will remember the situation in the former Rhodesia and the hope we all felt when the majority community was allowed to vote and dictate its own future but that hope and expectation has turned to despair.  There should be a greater degree of political activity and response from our Minister on what is happening in Zimbabwe.  I welcome Senator Ross's raising of the issue in the House last night because the disgraceful actions of Robert Mugabe, in particular the dreadful attacks on his own people, must continue to be highlighted.Burma was mentioned by Senator Ryan.  There is an opportunity for the Irish Government at EU level to keep that matter at the top of the political agenda.Regarding the United Nations, where Ireland has played a long and distinguished role, we should be to the fore in reforming the United Nations as part of our broader foreign policy.  While the UN has worked well over the years the new world order requires a new approach.  A new management structure is required for the UN and a different type of funding.  We should play a leading role in the reform of the United Nations and be sufficiently independent, not just on the European stage but on the world stage, to put UN reform at the top of our agenda.There are many regions of the world on which Government pronouncements could and should be stronger, for example, China and the persecution of the practitioners of Falun Gong.  A presentation was made to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the human rights sub-committee recently on the harvesting of organs from prisoners in what I would call concentration camps.  It appears practitioners of Falun Gong are being targeted and Ireland should strongly express its views to the Chinese Government, not just to the ambassador in Dublin but further afield, and state clearly that the persecution of anybody in China, be it Falun Gong practitioners or members of other religious denominations, goes against everything for which we stand.  We should not be afraid to do that.Mention of China brings me to the issue of Tibet, which has been raised frequently and very effectively in this House by Senator Norris.  This is yet another area of human rights concern worldwide but the growing economic development and expansion of China is making us too cautious in our willingness to call a political spade a spade.  Ireland should make regular representations to the Chinese authorities on those issues.The arms race was referred to by Senator Ryan.  The Cold War is over but there has been a shocking speeding up of the arms race at a time when new countries are emerging with the possibility of nuclear weaponry.  We must take a strong stance on the issue of nuclear proliferation.  The nuclear issue is being resurrected in France and Britain and that gives us an opportunity to take a strong political stance on this issue.  Our Government should not be silent on the matter.Successive Governments have had a strong record on the issue of overseas aid and development.  It is one area where the benefits of Irish foreign policy and the support of the Irish people is having a positive impact in the poorest countries worldwide, and I want that to continue.The development and implementation of an ethical foreign policy should be at the core of the Iveagh House agenda.  The motion before the House is worthy of support and I am disappointed that the Government amendment detracts from it.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	427	It gives me great pleasure to second the amendment.  It is an interesting motion but I wonder what it is meant to achieve.  I believe it is an attempt to embarrass the Government but in that respect it fails because successive Governments have pursued an ethical foreign policy.When Liam Cosgrave addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations he had to deal with two major events, namely the Suez invasion and the invasion of Hungary.  The former demonstrated that old empires could no longer expect to ride roughshod over the interests of sovereign states and the latter exposed the ruthless brutality of a new form of tyranny.  Over 30 years were to pass before Hungary was to finally regain its freedom.  Liam Cosgrave made it crystal clear how Ireland felt about these actions, both of which underlined the volatility of international relations at the time.A year later Frank Aiken reminded the General Assembly that another world war, whatever its cause, would neither democratise nor communise the world but annihilate it.  Ireland became dedicated to the reduction of international tensions and, in particular, to arms control.  Our efforts eventually bore fruit in the shape of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.As Senator Mooney said, we had not long been a member of the United Nations when we sent military observers into the Middle East and the Congo and we have since sent both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces into many places to serve under the United Nations flag.  We were committed to such work and our special contribution to the cause of peace continues today in Liberia and other countries.Foreign policy is set by Governments and Ministers but is carried out by diplomats.  I pay tribute to our outstanding diplomats, past and present.  Two in particular stand out, namely Freddie Boland, who was once president of the General Assembly, and the evergreen Conor Cruise O'Brien.  A modern historian has concluded that Ireland's independent role at the United Nations in that era was planned far in advance, thoroughly reviewed by Irish diplomats, professionally implemented and ardently defended.  Government and diplomatic service, therefore, worked together closely in establishing a tradition of well-considered support for effective multilateralism which has been a central feature of Ireland's foreign policy under successive Governments ever since.As part of our aid programme we are committed to reaching the overseas development assistance target of 0.7% by 2012.  The Government agencies' aid programme does not belong to the Government but to the people, who fund it through taxes, and Irish Aid is making a real difference to the lives of many thousands of people every day.  While this work is carried out on behalf of the Irish public and with their money, it seems that many people are not aware of its extent.We know from our long experience of peace-building and our recent term on the UN Security Council that where there is conflict, especially internal conflict, it is not enough to end the fighting.  Preventing a return to fighting requires a strengthening of institutions, the reintegration of fighters into society and a reasonable prospect of social and economic progress.  Yet the countries in question with weak institutions or none are those least likely to attract development funding and are most likely to once again fall into conflict.  When we held the European Presidency we agreed with our European partners that there was a gap in the UN system and that the EU should propose to the high-level panel the creation of a political body to mobilise and co-ordinate resources to keep fragile states from reverting to conflict or falling into it in the first place.Three key challenges face the world, which govern our foreign policy to a large extent.  One is the achievement of sustainable development and the elimination of poverty and disease.  The second is the promotion of universal human rights and the rule of law and the third is to ensure security, prevent conflict and end war.  Our overseas aid target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2012 is three years ahead of the schedule of the European Union.  We have published a White Paper clearly setting out our objectives in the context of the millennium development goals, with a special focus on Africa, poverty reduction, tackling hunger and HIV/AIDS.There can be no lasting development or security without full respect for human rights.  The human rights of the most vulnerable are especially important.  I strongly welcome the recent conclusion of negotiations on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  However, human rights are no use if they are written down but not adhered to.  An earlier speaker mentioned China, with whom we do business.  It is a huge market but is responsible for terrible abuses of human rights.  Some of the Senators who tabled the motion may query whether we should do business with a country that abuses people by, as Senator O'Toole said, cutting out their organs to sell, even if we make billions out of it.  It has a one-child policy, among other things.One of the challenges of foreign policy, even an ethical one, is to achieve the best we can in sometimes difficult situations, hoping that by doing business we can get people to see things our way, the democratic way, or to work more closely with the UN.  Senator Mooney mentioned the ASEAN conference, one of which I attended in Vietnam two or three years ago.  The case of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, or Myanmar, came up and I, along with many others, called for her to be released.  It is only by constant pressure, however, that these things can be achieved.On peace and security, Senator Mooney mentioned the peace-building commission.  It must be properly resourced and we have committed €10 million to the fund.  The single most important issue facing us is the Middle East and the dreadful events that happen there time and time again.  We can blame whomever we like, and I know who that would be if were given the chance, but we must always consider what we can do to heal the situation.  Ireland strongly supports the efforts to create a national unity government in Palestine and the Government has committed to a peace process reflecting the Quartet principles.The international community must also be generous in its response.  We acknowledge Israel's absolute right to exist in peace and security, which should be unchallenged.  Not least in its own interest, however, Israel must engage seriously and openly with Palestinians.  It must cease all activities, in particular the expansion of settlements, which are against international law and make a lasting peace harder to obtain.  I was in Syria and Lebanon recently.  I had previously been in Israel and could see the Golan Heights from both sides of the wall.  They are occupied by strangers put in place by the Israelis and have no tie with the country except their religion.  It is discriminatory.I gleaned information while I was there to the effect that an agreement had been reached between the Syrians and the Israelis whereby the latter would pull out of the Golan Heights and the former return to them, with the proviso that the Israelis be allowed to patrol them at any time they wanted.  The agreement was vetoed by Washington.  Again, during the fighting between Hizbollah and the Israeli defence forces a number of attempts were made by both sides to stop the war but each time Israel was instructed by Washington to continue.  We could get involved in this area and should never be afraid to do so.On nuclear non-proliferation, we want to see a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear programme and call on Iran to respond positively and rapidly to wide ranging proposals being put to it.  Equally we support the same efforts in respect of the six-party talks in North Korea.I support the amendment.  I understand the frustrations of some Senators who have looked at our foreign policy and do not understand it.  I do not understand every aspect of it myself but I believe successive Governments have done their best.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am glad to see him occupying a chair which his noble father occupied many a time before him.

It is not the first time he has been in the House.I had no problems adding my name to a motion of Seanad Éireann calling on the Government to develop and implement an ethical foreign policy, but the interesting word is "develop".  Nobody can complain about developing an ethical foreign policy.  That is not to suggest that the policy is not ethical already but it suggests it could be further developed.Irish people have been proud of our foreign policy over the years.  I recall that Frank Aiken stood out against the general foreign policy line by claiming that we should recognise red China, as it was then known, against the wishes of our American friends.  When Charles Haughey was Taoiseach it was decided not to support Britain in the Malvinas war.  Senator Norris gives that war another name but people who have been to Argentina know the correct name for the place.

I am not sure that we are neutral between good and evil but we are a non-aligned nation, with an involvement in the United Nations.  I recall going to Baldonnel in 1961 to watch the first airplanes carry Irish troops away to the Congo.  There was a real sense of pride in the nation.  We have had a foreign policy of which we can be proud.  The other aspect of our foreign policy has been overseas aid.There has been a moral and ethical policy throughout those years.  There is one exception.  I believe Ireland has not taken a balanced view with regard to Israel.  The voices we hear in the House tend to condemn Israel on practically every occasion so I wish to put a balancing argument against that viewpoint.

I will outline a little of the history.  After the 1967 war Israel offered a deal of land for peace.  That was turned down and the Arab summit held in Khartoum immediately afterwards arrived at its triple negative resolution — no negotiations, no recognition and no peace.  That is the line Hamas and Fatah have taken over the years.  Achieving peace in Northern Ireland has not been easy but at least we sought a way of reconciliation in some form or other, rather than insisting everything must be totally black or white.  Hopefully, from 8 May there will be peace in Northern Ireland.However, there is no sign of that peace arriving in the Middle East, particularly for Israel, in the Hamas attitude.  It continues to hold the three negatives of no negotiations, no recognition and no peace.  Its twin objectives are the end of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic republic from Jordan to the Mediterranean.  I believe there must be a balance on this issue.  It is not easy to solve the problem of the Middle East but we must attempt to get that balance.  The objective of countries such as Iran, who say they want to wipe Israel from the face of the earth, is similar to that of Fatah and Hamas.  There must be balance and I am not sure that Irish agencies and Government representatives seek that balance strongly enough.  It appears that we are continually afraid to criticise the Arab viewpoint, particularly the viewpoint so strongly voiced in that area.Look at what happened in the case of Egypt.  When Egypt bravely decided to recognise Israel, the Israelis left the Sinai and even abandoned a town they had built there.  Since then there has been peace on that 166 mile border.  Jordan, too, decided to recognise Israel and abandoned claims to the West Bank.  There has been peace along that 149 mile border as well.  However, what happened when Israel decided to leave Gaza last year?  As soon as it left, those who took over, Hamas and Fatah, poured bombs and rockets into Israel.  When Israel left Lebanon, and that was a difficult time——
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	438	What about the rockets and bombs the Israelis poured on top of people and the many casualties?

As soon as they did, the bombs and rockets were launched from there as well.  I am not defending the situation or trying to make it simple or easy.  However, I believe there has not been the balance of interests and moderation that is required if peace is to be achieved there.Israel was recognised by the League of Nations in 1924 and by the United Nations in 1947.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	440	We recognise the legitimate government of Palestine.

I am seeking to achieve a balance in our viewpoint.  I do not believe that balance is heard regularly in this House.  I am sure there is a strong opposing case to be made but the fact that I am not making that case is because it has so often been made in so many other ways in the past.Israel is the only state in the region where there is a free Arab trade union.  It is the only state that grants full equality to women and to gays.

I am concerned about the unbalanced nature of the words used in Ireland about Israel.  I believe Israel does not get the fair hearing it needs.  When we talk about an ethical, moral and fair foreign policy, we should include a fair, ethical and moral viewpoint on the balance of interests in that difficult region and take account of the fact that the voice of Israel should at least be heard.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I wish to share time with Senator Mansergh.  I was taken aback by the text of the motion.  I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was equally surprised by the text.  I agree that all good governments should have an ethical foreign policy and that it should be the basic tenet with which any sophisticated, democratic nation conducts its foreign affairs.  However, I am surprised that Senator Norris believes this Government must develop such a policy because usually he is fair in his assessments.  He appears to be misguided.  The Minister, his Department and the Government have been pursuing an ethical foreign policy.Consider some of the issues the Department has been working on recently.  The Minister outlined them earlier.  The Department and the Minister have been pushing for the United Nations Security Council to consider further measures against Sudan.  It is seeking to ensure that the country has sufficient peacekeeping support and humanitarian aid, and that the vulnerable people of Darfur are protected.  What is this, if not an ethical foreign policy?  The Senator will acknowledge that there is little economic or other selfish interest to be gained by the Government in these endeavours.  Was the provision of €5 million in funding to the African Union mission that is helping peace building in Sudan also not an ethical act?  What about the €29.7 million that has been provided in emergency and recovery funding to Sudan by the Government since 2004?These are not the only recent examples of ethical activity.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, took the opportunity of the recent EU and Association of South East Asian Nations meeting to raise Ireland's concern about the human rights situation in Burma and to call for the release of prominent political prisoners.  These concerns were expressed directly to the Foreign Minister of Burma.Earlier today the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, again emphasised the ethical nature of the Government's foreign policy when he stated the Government's opposition to nuclear weaponry and urged the nuclear states to undertake a policy of disarmament.  I could also refer to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, condemning the violence of Zimbabwe, the new five-year multi-annual agreement the Government has introduced for the aid agency, Christian Aid, or the pledge of extra funding for the United Nations assistance mission in Iraq.  The examples of the Government being ethical are endless.  We can consider the active participation by the Government with United Nations, European Union and the Council of Europe regarding human rights.  On the question of extraordinary rendition and prisoners being transferred through Ireland, I accept assurances from the Minister and I know what he is saying is correct.

The problem with moral principles is that they vary from person to person.  When two people are asked their views on any controversial area and they will invariably give two different answers.  No two people share the exact same moral principles just as no two people share the exact same opinions.

Senator Norris may have different views on how the Government should implement foreign policy.  I have no difficulty with that.  He is entitled to think that way and express his views on areas in which he believes the Government should act differently.  I am delighted with and have great confidence in the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his approach.  The Government is behaving ethically and morally in dealing with foreign affairs.

For example, we eschew the use of force, but of course, we do not have any force to use.  Unfortunately the term "ethical foreign policy" is a rather discredited term from British politics.  The former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, used the term and was then laughed to scorn when people saw the scale of arms sales, etc.

I am very suspicious of moral crusades particularly ones using force to justify a position.  One should not overdo the high ethical content because very often it is compatible with very shabby practices, as we know.I wish to respond to what Senator Quinn said.  Unfortunately I did not hear the previous contribution.  I agree that contributions to the Middle East are very often unbalanced in one direction or the other.  I believe that a policy of constructive engagement with Hamas is required.  That is, after all, what brought success to the peace process.  It is entirely unreasonable to suggest that recognition of the state of Israel be a precondition for any kind of engagement.  It would be like insisting that changing Articles 2 and 3 should have been a precondition of any negotiations on Northern Ireland.I am sorry that we are approaching a general election.  I received an invitation — I will not be more specific than this — to go to talk in a very distant part of the world to certain groups in the Middle East about the Irish peace process.  In any other circumstances I would have gone because I believe exchanges about experiences are important.  Senator Quinn claimed we are very hard on Israel.  The problem with the Middle East is that the United States is exceptionally soft on Israel.

I have perfect sympathy with Israel's right to exist within recognised borders.  However, it has not recognised the displacement and dislodgement of people who have been put into an area.  I recognise the Jewish people have had huge hurts and grievances historically — above all in the mid-20th century.  However, it has not accepted the harm caused by displacement.  There are certain parallels with the plantation of Ulster 400 years ago.

I suspect my colleagues who tabled the motion did so with extraordinary rendition or something similar in mind.  We have discussed that issue in the Seanad already this year.  I have no doubt that public pressure about suspected flights pushed the Government to request the guarantees it received from the US Administration.  If there were flights carrying prisoners or airplanes landing on their way to get prisoners, I am sure they discontinued at that point because of the media and public attention and because of our Ministers raising the matter.  I am reiterating a point I made on that day, namely that it was our Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who first raised the matter of extraordinary rendition in Europe.I agree with Senator Norris's views on US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice — I do not believe a word out of her mouth.  I do not mind putting it on the record, that President Bush is the worst American President in the history of the United States.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	461	The damage he has done to peace, international stability, the American economy and the United States abroad has been disastrous.  The quicker he goes the better.  The US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, visited Brussels as a result of our Minister applying pressure regarding extraordinary rendition.  This demonstrates our intention to deny any support for it.  I find the argument on both sides strange.  They do not seem to come together.  Those who support flights and those who do not support them do not seem to come together and clarify that we do not support extraordinary rendition.  The other side does not say, "We know you don't support rendition."The issue of extraordinary rendition offered us an opportunity to be a leader on the international stage by pressing for the review and updating of the 1944 Chicago Convention, which governs the information given about flights.  We should show initiative in this area, which is of concern to all European countries.  I blame US President Bush for what is happening in Iraq and for international instability.  It is too bad that it has seriously damaged the political legacy of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.  We could not have achieved the agreement reached last Monday without the support of Tony Blair.  It is sad that this is his legacy because he has no other.  His reputation is tarnished and damaged.  Undoubtedly, the roles played by the Irish and British Government in the North are a role model for peace.  Will people stop laughing when I am speaking?

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	465	In respect of the success of the peace process in the North, ultimately, dialogue had to take place.  I have said before in this House that dialogue, rather than physical force, is necessary.  We need dialogue in the Middle East.  Ireland will be a role model around the world and I have no doubt that Senator Mansergh will be invited to visit places on many occasions because Fr. Alec Reid is working intensively and passionately on the situation in the Basque country.  Hopefully, in time, Senator Mansergh will be able to give his attention to these issues.The other area I wish to discuss is Ireland's long-standing support for UN peacekeeping.  This is one of the most tangible expressions of our principles and values in foreign relations.  I draw attention to the fact that the Captain of the Guard, Comdt. John Flaherty; the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Comdt. Paul Conway; and one of the ushers, Mr. Mick Phelan, who is here in the Chamber, all served with UN peacekeeping and did us proud.  Coming from a country which was colonised for 800 years, we understand and identify with underdeveloped and developing countries.  We have empathy with developing countries and this is why we give aid, which will come to €650 million this year.  There will be people born in Third World and developing countries today who will live healthy lives as a result of the aid we give.  I wish to put on record my thanks for those I have named who have served with UN peacekeeping.

I find the tacit support of the South African Government for President Mugabe hard to take given that the South African population was trampled and walked upon.  The population in Zimbabwe is being trampled and walked upon, but the South African Government will not defend them.In his speech, the Minister said that he joined his EU colleagues in holding the Zimbabwean Government responsible for the safety of the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai.  He stated:On behalf of the Irish Government, I call for his immediate and unconditional release and that of his colleagues.  Our concerns about his arrest, however, do not stop there.  His arrest and the actions of the authorities raise fundamental questions about President Mugabe's respect for basic democratic norms, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.

I was so proud and knew that as a small country, we felt tremendous pride when the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs proudly spoke on the steps of UN headquarters and when we took an independent position and did not back the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  Subsequently, Mrs. Thatcher had a serious falling out with Mr. Haughey, which affected the Northern Ireland peace process.  It took tremendous courage on the part of Mr. Haughey to do this on that occasion.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I thank all my colleagues who took part in this debate.  It is a pity the Minister paid such a flying visit.  I wish he had been here to listen to some of my comments and tried to answer them.  He simply obfuscated.  Questions were not answered, which was extremely disappointing.I contrast this with the refreshingly honest, though sadly short, speech of Senator Mansergh because he understood exactly what I was getting at and said clearly and directly that what he felt was necessary for this country and others was a kind of realpolitik.  Did I hear a slight variation?  Was it echtpolitik?  I thought he might have made that little distinction, which would, no doubt, be lost on many of our listeners.  Senator Mansergh argued that its aim was to pursue the interests of the State.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	476	Yes, but the interests came first.  Senator Mansergh did not put the ideals first, which is very telling.  That is a position.  It is a very old-fashioned 19th-century position.  In a world that is globalised, it is no longer relevant.  It is the one thing that will get us into trouble.  At least, that is my opinion.  However, Senator Mansergh was honest and open and dealt with it.If, by realpolitik, he means we must talk to people we do not particularly respect or admire, he is right.  Certainly, in respect of the Middle East, I would be far closer to his analysis than that of my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn.  It is astonishing that we should talk about balance and not realise that it is quite the opposite direction to that suggested by Senator Quinn.  The balance is against the unfortunate Palestinians who have been hammered into the ground.  Look at the language used.  When half the Members of the Palestinian Parliament is snatched and kidnapped, we are told they are detained.  When two soldiers in a war situation are taken, they are kidnapped.  There is no balance.  Funds are being illegally kept away from a legitimate government.  It may be regrettable, but it was elected.  Do we believe in democracy?  Not, it seems, when it comes to the Palestinians.I was one of those who were crucially involved in the establishment of the first Israeli embassy here and have supported and continue to support the State of Israel, but I will not support any government, however close to it I am, that violates human rights.  I have said the same about the British Government in respect of the appalling vista.  It is time we grew up and faced these things.  If the British Government was involved and implicated in bombings and so on, we must know about it to ensure it never happens again.I have visited places like Twane and Sysia, which are little villages around south Hebron where I am glad to say my former partner, Ezra Yitzrak, whose life is under threat from American settlers, has worked.  It sickens me when I hear these people with twangy American voices speak as spokespersons for the Israeli Government and deny the rights of people who have been there for 500, 1,000 and 1,500 years.  I have seen what has happened there.  I know I will lose votes for saying it, but I will never stop doing so because I do not believe just in Jewish rights, Christian rights or Muslim rights.  I believe in human rights for all people.I am involved in a situation where a small town was demolished and a settlement built on it.  This is in the occupied territories and I remind Senator Quinn that it is an occupation.  It has been determined to be an occupation under international law and there is no getting away from that.  It is also an illegal occupation.  In that area, they moved the people out, built their settlement on top of it and employed the Arabs who were displaced to build the houses of their oppressors.  Now that the work is finished, they are demolishing the poor, unfortunate makeshift shacks and hovels they have and depriving them of the most basic levels of sanitation and health care.  I consider that an outrage and have a video of this incident which I will show to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.As someone who is so moved about the Holocaust, it shocks me to see young Israeli soldiers — men and women — laughing, sneering and ridiculing elderly and infirm people as the bulldozers smashed down their pathetic little dwellings.  That is not moral, it is disgusting.  There is an apartheid system in Israel at the moment, with the development of ghettos.  I know that angers my Jewish friends and so it should.  It is not the word that should anger them, however, but the reality on the ground that I have seen.  It has shamed me and I honour those people like Ezra who stand up against it.  I also honour the 19 air force pilots who refused to bomb the occupied territories because it was against international law.We had an appalling exhibition by the Minister who did not do me the courtesy of coming in and listening to what I had to say.  He obfuscated again and answered questions that had not been asked.  We know that airplanes were refuelled.  Senator White made a reasonable point that perhaps they stopped because of pressure from us.  The Minister said we have a great foreign policy and that our approach to Darfur, Zimbabwe and Burma is not motivated by self interest.  Of course it is not — we do not have any interests there, so it is easy to say that.We know they use torture, including water-boarding, and Condoleezza Rice has admitted it.  I want the House to listen to a description of water-boarding from an American practitioner who eventually decided to give up this horrible practice.  I remind the House that torture is defined by the United Nations as follows:  "Any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession".  This is what the man who practised water-boarding had to say about it:Water-boarding is a torture, period.  I ran a water-board team and administered dozens of students through the process as a tool to show what the worst looks like, short of death.  This is why there is a doctor and psychologist standing right next to the student — to do it safe and help the student recover.  It is not a simulation.  When applied you are in fact drowning at a controlled rate.  We just determine how much and how long you'll break.  Everyone breaks.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I move amendment No. a1a:In page 6, line 19, after "sea" to insert "or an oyster bed".These amendments were resubmitted because before this was put to the Dáil, there was a general consensus that the native oyster would not be subject to law and that people in the native oyster industry would not be subject to new proceedings.  I have tabled the amendment to have it on record, although I do not propose to press it.The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, will be familiar with the Foyle and the serious problems many of the area's major stakeholders and practitioners are experiencing in the areas of mussels or oysters.  Many of those involved in the industry find it difficult to develop a sustainable zoned management strategy.  Any strategy must be developed from the bottom up.I am glad departmental officials are in the House.  We must focus our efforts on moving forward with the new legislation with all the stakeholders and not just the representative organisations.  There are active harbour committees on either side of Lough Foyle but we must also convince practitioners of future plans and strategy.  Through his colleague, Deputy Keaveney, the Minister of State, a native of County Donegal, will be familiar with the challenges which lie ahead on the Foyle.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	493	In light of complications which have arisen in the past in areas other than aquaculture, is it possible that private individuals have foreshore or other rights in Lough Foyle or Carlingford Lough, perhaps dating back to landlord times?  Would such an eventuality cause a problem?  While it is possible the entire area covered by the legislation is in public ownership, the issue of ownership was not properly addressed in another area of fisheries.  The question of ownership should not be overlooked in case it creates a difficulty at a later date.  I am not as familiar with the Foyle and Carlingford areas as Senator McHugh.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy John Browne, who had intended to attend the debate but for good reason had to return to the south east.  Consequently, he asked me to take Committee Stage because I am familiar with these matters, having served in the Department for 15 months during which time I worked with officials on this unique Bill.  The legislation requires the consent of this House, having been passed in the House of Commons, and commencement orders will be synchronised in order that it will, when enacted, commence on the same date.I understand the reason Senator McHugh has tabled these amendments.  They seek to ensure the consent of the owner or occupier of an oyster bed or fishery is obtained prior to the granting of an aquaculture licence in respect of such an area.  Oyster fisheries in the Foyle are public fisheries and are not owned by any individual or body.  It is not necessary, therefore, to seek consent.Regional fisheries boards may issue oyster licences in this jurisdiction under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959.  However, this legislation does not apply to the Moville area and no such licences have been issued in respect of the Foyle by the regional fisheries board.  Oyster fishery orders may be made under the 1959 legislation but such orders do not apply to the Moville area.  In the circumstances, the amendments proposed are not necessary.The definition of the word "fish" in Part 3 was amended by the other House.  The amended definition provides that the agency will have responsibility for the regulation of wild mussels, wild oysters and eels, although predominately the first two.  The definition should also include all freshwater fish, salmon and other fish which migrate to and from the sea, as well as sea bass and tope.The amendment was made to address concerns expressed about the definition of the word "fish", especially concerns that the agency would regulate the wild oyster and mussel fisheries.  While I fully appreciate the spirit in which the amendment has been proposed by Senator McHugh, it is not necessary.  I appreciate his statement that the purpose of the series of amendments is to highlight a point and he does not propose to put them to the House.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, relate to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, which provides for an aquaculture licensing regime in Ireland, albeit one which does not apply to the Foyle area.  These amendments have been tabled to take account of the fact that it is possible that licences may be issued in the Louth area under the 1997 Act at the same time as the provisions concerning aquaculture in the legislation are commenced.  Aquaculture licences issued under the 1997 legislation do not take effect for a period of one month from the date of the publication of the decision to grant the licence.  The reason for this is to allow persons aggrieved by a decision which finds in their favour an opportunity to appeal.The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure the one-month period is retained to respect the right of an aggrieved person to appeal a licensing decision.  Amendment No. 2 ensures that the appeals provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 will apply in the case of licences issued under the Act at the time of the commencement of the legislation.  On commencement of the legislation, licences issued under the 1997 Act are deemed to be licences issued by the commission under this Bill.  This amendment provides that in an instant where the one-month period for making an appeal is still ongoing after the commencement of the legislation and an appeal is made against the decision to grant the licence, the appeal shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act.Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical consequential amendments to take account of changes of the numbering as a result of the insertion of the new subsection (2) by amendment No. 2.  The amendments, which have been proposed in the interests of those who wish to appeal a decision are laudable and I hope the House will accept them.

If the legislation went through as it stands, it would discriminate against those in the Louth area whereas there would be the opportunity for the one-month period in the Foyle area and the rest of the country.  This is to synchronise the Bill and not introduce legislation which would militate against those fishermen in the Louth area.

The practitioners on the ground and those involved in the industry were very appreciative of the movement which allowed many of their recommendations and suggestions to be taken on board.  The Minister has also added fish such as sea bass and tope to this list of definitions.  The amendment is similar to that taken in the Dáil.  I wish to record the appreciation in this regard.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I thank Senator McHugh for his understanding and appreciation.  Senators will be aware of the concerns expressed with regard to the definition of fish following the presentation of the Bill to the Oireachtas last year.  The Government proposed amendments on Committee Stage to address these concerns and to give effect to the advice from the Attorney General.  The amendments proposed were the subject of negotiations between a number of Departments and agencies, North and South, and represent the agreement reached during those further discussions to address the concerns raised by Members of the Dáil.These new definitions in sections 4 and 5(2) of the Bill, which were accepted on Committee Stage in the Dáil, reflect the agreed North-South position.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, indicated to the House on Second Stage, the scope for making changes to the Bill is restricted to changes necessitated by local law requirements, given that the Northern Ireland Order in Council has progressed through the parliamentary process in the United Kingdom.  Consequently, it is not possible to make the amendments proposed.I emphasise that the legislation, when enacted in the two jurisdictions, will give the Loughs Agency responsibility for the regulation of wild mussel, oyster fisheries, eels and all freshwater fish, and salmon and other fish of a kind that migrates to and from the sea, as well as sea bass and tope.  There was a suggestion that all fish should be incorporated.  However, the competence of the agency would then be in contradiction with the competence of the EU, which, whether one likes it or not — one might not like it — has responsibility for fish that are quota species.  It would mean we were giving the Loughs Agency jurisdiction, which would cause its own problems.The legislation, when enacted, will give the Loughs Agency responsibility for what we believe are the important species, namely, wild mussel, oyster fisheries, eels and all freshwater fish, and salmon and other fish of a kind that migrates to and from the sea.

#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, and the former Minister of State, now Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, for their co-operation in getting the Bill through the House so rapidly.  I thank their officials and everyone who contributed on Second Stage yesterday.  I thank Senator McHugh in particular for his co-operation on the issue.  This is important legislation and somewhat unique in that it is going through here and in the Houses of Parliament across the water at more or less the same time.  I thank all those who have helped ensure it goes through speedily.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I, too, welcome the passing of the Bill.  I offer a guarded welcome also to the work of the commission.  Its work was difficult because the advisory forum set up on both sides of the Border did not really have the right mechanisms in place due to the fact the Assembly was not up and running.  Now we expect the Assembly to be up and running, it is important we have a proper working advisory forum that works in tandem with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD, and the harbour boards on both sides of the Border.The Bill provides us with the opportunity to develop an effective loughs agency.  However, it is important to involve and bring all the stakeholders on board on the issue.  There is a feeling of disenfranchisment among stakeholders and it is important to get their agreement and that of all the relevant groups on this.  I hope that will be achieved through this Bill.  No doubt, our Department officials will ensure this happens.  The only way proper licensing will happen is through the commission, but it must work under the authority of a proper working advisory forum.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Chathaoirleach, do na Seanadóirí uilig, go háirithe an Seanadóir McHugh agus an Seanadóir Kenneally, agus don Teach iomlán as ucht an chomhoibriú maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo, Bille Iascaigh an Fheabhail agus Chairlinn 2006.  Ar ndóigh, mar atá a fhios againn go léir, d'fhás an reachtaíocht seo as Comhaontú Aoine an Chéasta.  Is iontach tráthúil é go bhfuil an reachtaíocht ag dul tríd an Teach an tseachtain seo, tar éis an chomhaontú agus an chomhoibriú idir na páirtithe móra a bheidh i mbun rialtais sa Tuaisceart ag tús mhí Bealtaine.Mar a dúradh, tá an reachtaíocht seo fíor-thábhachtach.  Is reachtaíocht faoi leith atá ann ós rud é go bhfuil comhoibriú idir muid san Oireachtas agus an Rialtas sa Bhreatain Mhór.I thank the Senators and the House, in particular Senators McHugh and Kenneally, for their co-operation and their understanding of this complex and unique Bill which required the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.  The legislation is unique also in that it grew out of the Good Friday Agreement and what came afterwards.  As recently as Monday last we saw that two main parties in the North have decided to work together under the d'Hondt system and establish a government at the beginning of May.I thank both Senators and the Chair.  I also acknowledge the commitment and good will of officials from a number of offices and Departments in Northern Ireland, officials from our Attorney General's office and the officials from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I thank all of them for the work they have done in progressing this legislation.  I hope the legislation will be beneficial to the many stakeholders involved in the Foyle region.Mo bhuíochas arís agus go raibh maith agaibh as ucht an reachtaíocht a chur tríd ina hiomlán an tseachtain stairiúil seo.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This is a small but important Bill.  It gives us an opportunity to contribute to the global problem of emissions, while maintaining competitiveness, by investing in developing countries.  I congratulate the Minister on his foresight particularly for having appointed the National Treasury Management Agency which has recently proved its worth, to deal with this investment.  I am delighted that the Bill has been completed.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I wish to be associated with Senator Brady's comments.  While we are considering the big picture we also need to get the detail right.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister's officials for all their endeavours.To digress for a moment, will the Minister use his good offices and direct line to the born-again squeaky green Taoiseach who is going to Donegal tomorrow where he will perform several duties?

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	512	Probably, and counting at this stage because he will be under serious pressure from his many candidates in that constituency.  Could the Minister use his good offices to encourage the Taoiseach to go to a conference in Redcastle which is considering the environment and alternative energy sources?  The Minister is probably aware of Inishowen Rural Development Limited, IRDL, a hard-working group which is studying best practice models in Sweden, Norway and Finland which they will discuss tomorrow.  As the Taoiseach is on the green warpath he may find time tomorrow to call into the Carlton Redcastle Hotel.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I thank the Seanad for an interesting debate.  To respond to Senator McHugh's last point, whatever I might suggest to the Taoiseach or any other leader with a conscience about the future of the planet, I would not suggest that he follow the very bad example of Finland which is building several nuclear plants.  The same applies to the equivocal example of Sweden which is always put forward as a model for environmental policy and which disappointingly seems to be going in the nuclear direction too.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I referred to examples of best practice as the Minister will appreciate.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	515	The Senator is right.  The Taoiseach could lecture both countries and point to the exemplary standards we adopt, although he is not the type of person who lectures.  We have made in successive Governments with the agreement of all parties in the House the most morally defensible decision not to go for nuclear power.  The Norwegians are on God's side too and on our side in that respect.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Minister brought the nuclear issue into the debate.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I said I would not take any lectures from Sweden or Finland, which is the first western European country in a decade to build a nuclear reactor.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	520	It has many other examples of best practice.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	521	Not in that regard.  Its excuse for doing this is that it is using the Kyoto Protocol, which is a disappointment.I thank the Members for their contributions to the debate.  The Government is committed to meeting the Kyoto Protocol and doing so in a sustainable, and morally appropriate, transparent way that is fully consistent with the Kyoto Protocol.  We will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 15.2 million tonnes each year which is a significant challenge.  The point has been made several times during the debate that this does not depend on the Government alone but that every citizen must play his or her role.I thank all those who contributed to the debate here and in the Dáil.  Sadly, some have adopted what I regard as the rather eccentric view that we should support the Kyoto Protocol but reject one of its central tenets.  That debate is in the past.  The Bill under discussion is good and I am very grateful to both Houses for their assistance in the matter.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Amendment No. 14 is out of order.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	527	On Committee Stage, I had similar amendments tabled and the Minister offered me assurances on some of the issues covered.  These included issues such as parking during events in Croke Park, in respect of which the Minister tabled his own amendment.  He also guaranteed that one device would cover all tolls and that there would be a move towards barrier-free tolling.  I was happy enough with his position on many of the issues and have therefore not moved my amendments.Will the Minister of State outline the position on traffic control, especially on our national primary routes and motorways?  Regarding the serious accidents that occurred yesterday on the N7 and N9, I convey my sympathy to the family of the woman who lost her life and wish a speedy recovery to the injured.  The crash on the N7 was, without doubt, the biggest in the history of the state.  It brings home to us the consequences of careless or excessively fast driving in serious fog or on frosty roads.  It forces us to question how we will supervise national primary routes and motorways in the event of such accidents.There has been much talk on the adjustment of speed limits at a moment's notice and I am sure a system to achieve this would be computerised such that changes could be made at the flick of a switch.  The Bill under discussion will increase speed limits from 100 km/h to 120 km/h on certain routes, with which I agree, but we cannot allow a recurrence of disasters such as those on the N7 and N9.Let us consider the N4, the Kilcock route, which is to be constructed by way of public private partnership.  It is to be maintained and run by a private consortium.  Could a system be introduced to adjust speed limits downwards during adverse weather conditions?  Would control of this system be handed over to those with the maintenance contract or would the Garda be responsible?  I presume a balance would be struck between the Garda, the National Roads Authority and the consortium.  Urgent action needs to be taken and we need some sort of system that can kick in immediately if poor weather is forecast.The accident on the N7 was a freak and has never occurred before.  I congratulate the emergency services personnel in Naas General Hospital, who responded quickly, and the fire brigade in County Kildare.  They all did a great job and I wish them well.However, there is a need to introduce some form of legislation or ministerial order to resolve this matter.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister of State for bringing it before the House.  I have no doubt the situation will be improved when the Bill is enacted because it covers many outstanding issues.  I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Before I deal with the questions raised, I wish to thank Senators for their interest in the Bill and for dealing with this matter so promptly.  I welcome the overall positive and constructive contributions from Senators.I dealt with the Bill on Committee Stage and Report and Final Stages and I am aware of the clear understanding of the Bill evident from Senators Paddy Burke and Wilson.  I thank Senator Paddy Burke for withdrawing his amendments.  I acknowledge his input and that of Senator Wilson on the various Stages of the Bill.  While we may not have accepted the amendments, we embodied the principle of them, especially in regard to parking around stadia and where events are held, in the Government amendments.In recent years, Senators have shown great interest in and concern about road issues.  I have worked with them in bringing through aspects of the Roads Bill and in the establishment of the National Roads Authority.  We are all aware of Ireland's economic development.  The quality of citizens' lives is closely connected to disposable income and the money we invest in our national infrastructure such as roads.In addition, the Bill improves and strengthens the position of the National Roads Authority as it continues to deliver large-scale investment in our national roads and in local roads which come under the responsibility of local authorities.  Together with the Minister, Deputy Cullen, I opened a number of roads in the past 12 to 15 months.  All of them came in on time and within budget.  I believe we will see all of the other projects come in on time and within budget.Many of the changes made in the Bill are in recognition of the evolution of the role of the main players in the roads building programme since the introduction of the Roads Act in 1993.  The Bill also takes account of the changing needs of national roads and the requirement to protect for future generations the record levels of investments on roads.I wish to be associated with Senator Paddy Burke's remarks on speeding and to sympathise with the family of the woman who lost her life in yesterday's pile up.  I also wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.  I extend my sympathy to all families who recently lost those who are near and dear to them.  If we compare the fatalities this year with those of last year, the number is much less but that gives little solace to the many families who have lost members who are near and dear to them this year.  The various measures we have taken and the legislation we have introduced has contributed in some way to the reduction in fatalities.  We tend to forget those who are injured and maimed in accidents.  The statistics relate to those who are killed but we know many people have been seriously injured and whose quality of life has changed dramatically overnight.Senator Paddy Burke made a suggestion on the improvement of electronic warning signs.  We would expect to see variable message signs rolled out in the coming year by the National Roads Authority.  We all realise we are largely responsible for our own safety.  I believe the culture is changing and this can contribute greatly to the reduction in fatalities.  Days like yesterday are possibly a dear lesson to those who were badly injured.  It is important that drivers would relate their speed to the circumstances of the day.  This is not just the case when we have fog but also when there is frost and snow and the roads are treacherous.I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members of the House for their support, understanding and contributions which have improved aspects of the proposed legislation.  Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl dos na Seanadóirí agus don Teach as ucht an chomhoibriú ar gach taobh maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo, Bille na mBóithre 2007.  Tá mé fíor-buíoch dos na Seanadóirí as ucht an cuidiú agus tacaíocht a thug siad dom.In reply to Senator Paddy Burke's question on PPPs, that will be a matter for the National Roads Authority.  If it is to introduce variable signs, it will have to consult with those responsible for PPPs, especially in Kilcock, to ensure any changes to the roads that have been built directly and indirectly by the NRA, and others, will have to comply with that as well.

I also thank all Senators who contributed to the debate, especially Senator Paddy Burke.  We had a lively Second Stage debate on the Bill but it was worthwhile.  The Minister of State took on board some of the topics discussed on Second Stage and aspects of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage.  I thank him for doing so.The Bill provides for a number of measures, most importantly, barrier-free tolling, which will help relieve traffic congestion along with the other works that are taking place, especially on the M50.  I welcome the fact that it will allow certain roads to be classified as motorways as this will raise the speed limit on them from 100 km/h to 120 km/h.  The Bill is an important item of legislation and once again I thank all who contributed to it, especially the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher and his officials.

It was brought to my attention in recent months by a number of public health nurses and various members of the medical services in my area of Carlow and Kilkenny that there is a problem with the operation of the child health screening programme.  I am not familiar with the operation of the scheme throughout the country or even in my own area but I am aware the scheme, as originally operated, provided a useful service for children, their families and the State in identifying illnesses or other problems children might have at an early stage and acting upon them as soon as possible.In recent years it appears the operation of the scheme has become more haphazard in that not as many tests are being carried out or not as many aspects of the child's health are being covered as was the case previously.  I am anxious to hear the Minister of State outline the current position on the number of children being reached by the scheme and any views he or the Government has on how the scheme could be revised and modernised to ensure it continues to provide a useful service, in particular in detecting difficulties children might experience with their hearing or sight, dental checks and so on.  The scheme provided a useful service in that regard and I hope it will continue in future.  I am sure the Minister of State has detailed information on the way the scheme operates and any changes envisaged in the foreseeable future.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the importance attached by the Department and the Health Service Executive to child health screening.The matter raised by the Senator relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  I am not aware of the reports referred to by the Senator.  However, I set out below the principles guiding the provision of school screening services.Best Health for Children introduced national recommendations on the child health screening and surveillance programme in 1999, and these were revised in 2005.  In summary, current recommendations regarding child health screening that should be offered to children attending primary school are as follows: health assessment at school entry with follow-up selective medical examination where necessary; hearing screening at school entry; and vision screening at school entry and exit.The school screening service is public health nursing led and where anomalies are discovered, children are referred to the area medical officer service, community ophthalmology or a service relevant to the issue highlighted.  Should any urgent medical issues arise, an appropriate referral is advised immediately.  There is coverage of all public primary schools and uptake rates are very satisfactory.  In areas where the service is unable to visit all schools during the school year, the outstanding schools are visited as early as possible the following school year.  Particular emphasis is placed on children who join a school who have not had a previous school health examination and in these cases, all elements of the screening programme are provided to those children.A health assessment questionnaire for completion by parents has been also introduced in some areas and, based on the review of these questionnaires by the school public health nurse, children are referred to school medical clinics at their local health centre if necessary.  In the case of a child being absent on the day of screening, parents are offered the facility of bringing their child to the local health centre for screening at a nurse-led child health clinic.  I have been informed by the HSE that the statistical information on the coverage achieved by the programme since 2000 is not available.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I recently visited Ballylanders primary school and met the principal and other staff members.  There was extreme disappointment that they were unsuccessful in their application for the grant for national schools under the small schools scheme 2007.  Ballylanders is a fast-growing community which in recent times has seen a rapid expansion of staff in all three of its local factories.  Part of the workforce includes foreign nationals, mainly Polish and Lithuanian workers.  Construction is buoyant in the area, which has led to many service-led firms in the area.Recent extra planning applications for 83 private houses and for the development of seven acres for a commercial and industrial enterprise park will give a new impetus to Ballylanders in the future.  There is also an application for a 60-bedroom nursing home and 40 retirement homes.  All these developments will lead to an expansion of the population and attract more non-nationals to the area.The school has experienced an increased enrolment of 17% since 2005 and now has 75 pupils.  The projected enrolment for 2007 is 87, which will entitle the school to an extra teacher appointment.  Ballylanders national school is a three-classroom building constructed in 1893.  Two of the classrooms have dry rot and it has very high ceilings.  In 1998-99 an extension for indoor toilets and a staff room were added to the rear of the school.  A corridor was taken off the middle classrooms to facilitate access to the toilet block, which has resulted in a smaller, misshaped classroom with three doors leading from it.  Two open into other classrooms and the other into the new corridor.  The parents are concerned that the classrooms constitute a health and safety hazard because school bags obstruct entrances and exits and they have expressed their concern to the board of management.The school now has five non-national children on the roll and in January 2007 appointed a language teacher for one hour daily.  This person works in a disused prefab, formerly an outdoor toilet block dating from pre-1980.  The resource teacher, who is shared, works in the same prefab.  The Department of Education and Science is leasing a portakabin and paying 95% of the cost to accommodate a school-based learning support teacher.  Ballylanders is located at the side of a busy main road and it is essential that all pupils attending the outdoor classes be accompanied at all times.The school has been designated as qualifying under the DEIS rural scheme.  To help it overcome some of the disadvantages confronting it, it is vital the necessary accommodation be provided to carry out the principles of the revised curriculum effectively.  The board of Ballylanders national school has applied to the Department of Education and Science for a permanent extension to the school, as any further portakabins would hinder the health and safety of the pupils, increase the workload of the staff and reduce the green area of the field.I appeal to the Minister to consider the school's appeal favourably.  It is imperative the Department grants approval for this much-needed extension.  A development at the school will leave it well-positioned in the future to cater for the expanding number of pupils attending.  Failure to proceed now will have serious implications for the future expansion of the school.  I sincerely hope the Minister responds with good news.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the development of education provision in the school referred to by the Senator.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, this Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.As evidence of this commitment, in excess of €540 million will be spent on building and modernisation projects in the coming year on primary and post-primary schools.  Since 1997, a total of €3 billion has been invested in school buildings and this has delivered more than 7,800 school building projects.  The additional investment of more than €540 million will build on these achievements and will focus in particular on the provision of school accommodation in areas where the population is growing at a rapid rate.  As further evidence of our commitment, national development plan funding of €4.5 billion will be invested in schools over the coming years.I am sure the Senator will agree that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.  On top of this, to reduce red tape and allow projects to move more quickly, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for eight and 16-classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.  The design and build method is also used to expedite delivery where the use of standard designs is not possible.  Taken together with the unprecedented level of funding available, these initiatives ensure building projects are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.Ballylanders national school, County Limerick, submitted an application under the small schools scheme in 2007.  On 5 March 2007, the Department of Education and Science announced details of the schools to receive funding under this scheme.  Owing to the volume of applications received in the Department it was not possible to allocate funding to all proposed projects and Ballylanders was not successful in this instance.  However, the board of management of the school has made an appeal, which is under consideration in the Department.  Once a decision on the appeal has been reached, officials from the Department will contact the school authorities.  Once again, I thank the Senator for raising this matter which allows me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the position regarding Ballylanders national school, County Limerick.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  A report has been presented today to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and it is an indictment of the level of investment in the past ten years.  I will talk specifically about the interdepartmental report, launched in Donegal in July 2006, and the task force report commissioned by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.A plan was supposed to have been put in place by the Government for Donegal but it has not materialised.  Today's report on the Border, midlands and western region identifies negatives and gaps apparent to the public in Donegal for some considerable time.  The region encompasses a number of counties but no county has suffered as much as County Donegal as a result of the lack of investment.At the end of June 2005, the total spend was 50% of the original forecast.  That followed a mid-term review in 2003 which found there had been a €400 million underspend in the BMW region on infrastructure and ancillary investment.  There was a 36% underspend on agriculture and rural development, a 41% underspend on sea fisheries development and a 35% underspend on industry.The BMW regional assembly commissioned a study whose results, to say the least, are alarming.  An audit of innovation report was produced in 2004 which showed a disproportionately low number of new company start-ups in the BMW region; an overall low level of company performance and growth; a number of weaknesses in innovation; low levels of research and development, venture capital and entrepreneurial culture; weaknesses in the ICT and pharmaceutical sectors; an absence of links with third level institutions; and vulnerability due to lack of or poor infrastructure in air services, telecommunications, road and rail networks and energy.The innovation report was presented in November 2005 to the Taoiseach, with suggestions for improvements and solutions for places such as Donegal and the greater BMW region.  The audit was produced in 2004.  This is 2007 and little or no progress has occurred.  I was part of a team that commissioned the report, Creating a More Inclusive Labour Market, two years ago.  We presented a series of key recommendations to assist the labour market in Donegal and regarding key areas of investment.  These have not been realised either.County Donegal has a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit despite the successive lack of investment by the Government.  In the face of the constraints presented by peripherality and the lack of road and rail links, telecommunications and broadband infrastructure, we have managed to fight the fight.  Rather than talk about the past, I call on the Minister to outline a map for progress in County Donegal.  The Government must implement policy as it should be implemented.  The underspend of €400 million in 2003 on the BMW region, including Donegal, can no longer be justified, especially given what will happen in Donegal in the future.  The new institutions will be up and running as a result of the re-establishment of the Assembly and we must work closely with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, with Donegal County Council and with the people we represent.There have been lame duck excuses for not investing in the west, such as that offered by the Department of Finance two years ago which stated that the reason for pumping investment into infrastructural projects in the east was to clear the bottlenecks.  It is time Government representatives and Ministers realised that the solution to the problems in the east is to open up infrastructure in the west.  If proper infrastructure and access can be provided in counties Clare, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, IDA Ireland will start to source potential business for those regions.  If we provide free access to the west of Ireland, we can provide a solution to the bottlenecks in the east.We need a strategy that will work and that encompasses every aspect of infrastructure, from rail to broadband to port and airport solutions.  We must have that strategy.  An opportunity was missed in the past ten years.  People in the north west and west will no longer accept the lame duck excuses for successive investment in the east of the country.  The solution lies in opening up the west and north west.  We do not need any more excuses for the lack of progress and for not following the policy that has been mapped out for almost 20 years.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I thank Senator McHugh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Donegal employment initiative task force was established in September 1998 by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.  Included in its terms of reference were three specific actions: to assess and recommend the most appropriate responses to offset and compensate where there are any immediate risks to jobs in particular areas of Donegal; to draw up a set of priority actions for establishing Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creation; and to assist the development agencies in selling Donegal locations to prospective investors.The employment initiative task force report set targets for the enterprise, tourism, public, community and voluntary sectors.  The report also set out the resource and funding requirements necessary for Donegal over a seven-year period.  A review was undertaken by the Donegal County Development Board in 2005 of the implementation of the task force report.  Among the findings of the board was the belief that significant implementation had taken place of those actions and projects over which the local actors had control and were able to drive their implementation.While acknowledging substantial progress in the support of air access to the county and the extension of broadband, the review found that the area in which the most significant impediments to the economic development of the county continued to exist was its infrastructure, the development of which is dependent on Government decisions and various Departments' funding.  It was in that context, as well as some more recent major job losses, that the interdepartmental group on Donegal was subsequently established at the request of the Government.  In July 2006, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, published the report of the interdepartmental group.  The interdepartmental group was asked to focus on the progress being made on infrastructural requirements to make Donegal a more attractive location for enterprise creation, especially as it makes the transition from traditional to more modern and higher value added industries.The report showed that Donegal has no shortage of advantages and opportunities in so far as the promise of a brighter future for its inhabitants is concerned.  There is a dynamic combination of State development agencies active in Donegal which are committed to enhancing the attractiveness of the county for business.  These agencies have demonstrated the ability to provide a clear vision and focus for future economic development.  IDA Ireland aims to pursue more knowledge-based, greenfield foreign direct investment for Donegal and to convince existing IDA Ireland clients to transform their current operations into higher value activities.  Enterprise Ireland will encourage and assist more innovative, technology-led companies and promote a greater level of start-up activity.  These actions are in response to the challenges facing traditional industry in the county, which is under pressure for competitiveness reasons, and both agencies, as well as Údarás na Gaeltachta, are endeavouring to meet these challenges.Enterprise Ireland has also been very active in supporting the development of community enterprise centres in the north west which are critical to continued enterprise development in rural areas and to the development of an entrepreneurial culture.  Nine community enterprise centres in County Donegal have received funding of approximately €2 million under the community enterprise centre scheme to date.  In Donegal town, IDA Ireland has commissioned architects to design a 1,000 sq. m. office building at Lurganbuoy.  IDA Ireland has applied for planning permission for the building and a decision from Donegal County Council is imminent.  It is planned to enter discussions with the private sector regarding the construction and provision of this building as soon as planning permission is received.  I am confident a substantial number of new jobs will arise from this initiative. In Ballyshannon, IDA Ireland has undertaken a significant amount of site development work on the industrial estate and this work is now complete.  The county enterprise board will continue to provide existing and new supports to micro enterprises.The lack of much needed infrastructure has been highlighted as an obstacle to job creation in County Donegal over a number of years.  The interdepartmental report highlighted many developments under way or planned in the areas of roads and air transport, water supply and treatment, broadband, energy and education.  These have been solidified and strengthened in the recently launched National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Particular emphasis has also been placed in the NDP on North-South co-operation and developments which will be of direct benefit to County Donegal.  An important study on the development of the all-island economy has recently been completed and this sets out a clear and strong economic rationale for all-island economic activity.  InterTrade Ireland, the all-island trade and business development body set up under the Good Friday Agreement, is supporting the development of key business networks on the island of Ireland, including the North West Science and Technology Partnership.  This partnership between industry, academia and other key stakeholders is focused on strengthening science and technology-based innovation and business in the north west.I am confident that we will see major advantages for County Donegal and the north west flowing from the re-establishment of the political institutions in Northern Ireland.  The Senator will be aware that funding, to include Government investment of €580 million, is to be set aside for linking the North and South.  This will allow for considerable progress to be made under the North-South initiative regarding the national roads programme, in particular on the A5 Aughnacloy to Derry route via Omagh and Strabane.  The plan commits specifically to the completion by 2013 of a high-quality road network on the interurban routes linking the major population centres of Dublin, Belfast and the north west, especially the Letterkenny-Derry gateway.  The A5 Aughnacloy to Derry route via Omagh and Strabane and the announcement today are a major development in the achievement of this goal.We have already seen improvements along the A5, in particular the works that have been completed at Omagh, Newtownstewart and Strabane and the continued improvements are making a real difference to accessibility to County Donegal and the north west.  This will be further improved when the NRA completes the Castleblaney bypass later this year.  The Government is committed to improving the roads from the M1 to the Border at Aughnacloy and from the Border at Lifford to Letterkenny.Under the north-west gateway initiative launched by the two Governments in 2005 there was a commitment to examining the potential for joint investment in key infrastructure projects.  In line with that commitment, the National Roads Authority and the Roads Service of Northern Ireland undertook research on potential road infrastructure projects which would have cross-Border benefits.  Progress on the A5 in Northern Ireland will help in opening up County Donegal on a commercial and socio-economic level by providing the much-improved infrastructural access to the county.The north-west region is a priority area for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland as the agencies continue to market this region strongly for new investment.  The job creation achieved over the past year is largely as a result of the ongoing commitment to County Donegal from the State development agencies which will continue this commitment into the future.  The Senator will be aware of the significant employment developments for County Donegal recently.  In addition to the Abbott announcement, recent major job announcements include SITA, ZEUS, PowerBoard and AssetCo.The Government and the State development agencies are fully committed to fostering the environment for job creation in County Donegal with economic benefits accruing right across the county.
