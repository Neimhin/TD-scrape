          <p eId="para_1">I have consistently raised with the Taoiseach the disconnect between rhetoric and reality and between aspiration and delivery. Nowhere are they to be seen more than in the damning report issued yesterday by Professor Geoffrey Shannon, special rapporteur to the Government on child protection. It is a report that calls into question the commitment of the Government to fulfil its constitutional obligations in the protection of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The Taoiseach will recall that in 2012 the Government held a referendum on the protection of children's rights, whereby the State recognises and affirms "the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, protect and vindicate those rights". However, yesterday's report shows that the State has not vindicated the rights of the most vulnerable children in society. Professor Shannon calls it a wake-up call. It is a damning indictment of how we go about trying to protect vulnerable children. He analysed over 5,400 cases over eight years and said they revealed many unpalatable truths about our society. He also said: "Children are treated like human trash in some of these cases." He found failures in the PULSE, police using leading systems effectively, system, a lack of child protection training for gardaí, poor and limited inter-agency co-operation and co-ordination and repeat removals of children. In other words, children in vulnerable situations were removed by gardaí under section 12, only to end up back in the same vulnerable setting shortly afterwards. The complete absence of an out-of-hours social work service is highlighted in the report and Professor Shannon says there is also a troubling gap in how children with behavioural difficulties are treated by the system. This, in many ways, represents a damning indictment of the Government's performance since the enactment of the change to the Constitution in 2012. That amendment was all about protecting the children of the nation, particularly the most weak and vulnerable. Why is there no comprehensive out-of-hours social work service? What does the Government intend to do about this? Why is there so little emphasis in the Garda Training College in Templemore on child protection training as a core part of the training programme? This is something that emerged strongly from the audit. Why is that so? There is a need to fundamentally change our culture in how we protect vulnerable children in the community.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_3">Obviously, I am upset about this. The establishment of Tusla as the Child and Family Agency was part of the overall strategy of making children and the family central in Ireland, with the appointment of a senior Minister to the Cabinet, the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, holding of a referendum on children's rights and passing of subsequent legislation in various respects that would impact on society and social Ireland. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is funded by the taxpayer to a substantial amount. Last night's programme made for harrowing viewing, to say the least. It showed the unconscionable circumstances in which some children in this country found themselves. It is unacceptable. This is in the place, their home, where they are supposed to feel most loved, safe and valued. I believe I can speak for everybody here and every parent who watched in saying it was distressing viewing for parents. I say to the social workers who feel they are battling a system and the trainees who feel the same way that they should not be afraid to speak up and speak out. Many feel gagged and unable to speak the truth about what they know might be happening in some places.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> There are a number of criticisms made in the report, in the audit commissioned by the Garda and in the media coverage of it. They relate, in particular, to the out-of-hours social work service and the level of communication between Tusla and An Garda Síochána. It must be remembered that the period under review is 2008 to the end of 2015 and that there have been continuous improvements in the child protection area and Tusla operations since. Professor Shannon, whom I greatly respect, at the launch of the report on Monday, 29 May, expressed his full confidence in Tusla's child protection framework. On the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place in November 2015 and there is now a national service which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">There is emergency foster and residential care for a child removed from his or her family under this provision. As part of this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and on bank holidays to assist An Garda Síochána in what are the busiest areas, namely, Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow. In the remaining counties the volume of calls indicates that contact with Tusla social workers by telephone has been sufficient to date, but this is clearly under review. Some concerns have been expressed about the placement of such children in Garda stations and hospitals. I have been reassured that social admissions to hospital take place only in exceptional circumstances and only where a placement is for the child's own safety. Tusla does not request the Garda to keep a child over part of a night. That is a Garda decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> On the level of communication between Tusla and An Garda Síochána, I am informed that regular strategic liaison meetings take place at senior level to deal with the inadequacy pointed to.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">The Taoiseach's last line, that Tusla does not instruct An Garda to keep anybody in a Garda station and that it is a matter for the Garda, sums it up. It sums up the pathetic nature of buck-passing and is trying to mask the reality of the findings of the report, which states the initial <i>de facto</i> place of safety for children is the Garda station. There is no point in dressing it up or trying to sugar-coat it by saying it is a Garda decision. One should remember that section 12 contains a very rare power. A garda does not have to go to the courts or anything, but where he or she is convinced that a child is in danger, in the home or another setting, he or she must take him or her out of that danger. However, he or she has nowhere to put the child. There is no comprehensive out-of-hours social work service available.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> It is not about people being gagged and so on. This is a comprehensive report. In fairness, I commend the Garda for commissioning the audit, but it involved very extensive consultation with gardaí on the exercise of the section 12 power. There is frustration and annoyance and a lack of basic resources in terms of the number of social workers in the field in this area. The <i>de facto</i> position is that there is no proper comprehensive out-of-hours social work service available; that is the reality. We need to go behind the language, rhetoric and defensive position, acknowledge the essential truths in the report and resolve to deal with them. The next budget should be the first signal on the resource side of such a commitment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">As far as the Government and I are concerned, the issue should not be about the protection of the structure of Tusla but about the protection of children and accountability and transparency with regard to why the taxpayer puts money into Tusla in the first place. That should be evident to everybody. If that is not the case, we have to deal with the issue. My understanding - the Minister has obviously asked for a full report on it - is that work is already well under way on the many issues commented on by Dr. Shannon in his final report. Tusla will continue to roll out its national child care information system, which will significantly improve the information available on vulnerable children.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> I understand the Garda national child protection unit is carrying out an audit at local level of the child protection operations between Tusla and An Garda Síochána to see what is happening, or, perhaps more importantly, what is not happening. Divisional protective service units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions and effective liaison with Tusla will be a central feature of these units. Why not? In other places there are people who sit around the table from all of the various sectors to discuss these issues on a regular basis. A joint protocol is being finalised between Tusla and the Garda on the operation of section 12, which is an important section of the Act. This will provide clear and extensive guidance on a range of issues affecting children at risk. It will address many of the issues raised in the report by Dr. Shannon. </p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Best practice in child protection is evolving all the time. Research and reports like that of Dr. Shannon, commissioned by the Garda, provide a very necessary and valuable opportunity to review, reflect and strive to have an improved service.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">We are not finished with this at all. This has to be about the protection of children and not about the protection of the structure. I share the Deputy's view on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">The report from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the State's special rapporteur on child protection, on the use by An Garda Síochána of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 and the details that emerged on last night's "RTÉ Investigates" programme are, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, both frightening and scandalous. According to Dr. Shannon, co-operation between Tusla and An Garda Síochána is "overwhelmingly inadequate". He made 17 recommendations. As some of these are so basic and common sense, it raises the question as to why these were not put in place long before this. For example, there is a recommendation on the need for all gardaí to undergo diversity training and the need for inter-agency co-operation. The big failures in the system are the lack of capacity, the absence of an out-of-hours service and Tusla's reliance on private foster care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Dr. Shannon stated that vulnerable children are getting an inferior service and that it is absolutely scandalous that some of these private services refuse to take children with challenging behaviour. I cannot think of a more telling indictment of the State's child protection services than the charge that vulnerable children are receiving an inferior service. I am very certain the Taoiseach is upset by this. However, I am sure that he will also accept that expressions of regret just will not cut it anymore. The child protection system is broken and the Taoiseach's Government is charged with fixing it. I call on the Taoiseach to ensure Dr. Shannon's 17 recommendations are implemented in full and that this is done immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Citizens will be shocked to hear that child protection training for gardaí is basically non-existent. Contrary to what the Taoiseach said about strategic meetings at a senior level, according to this report, the lack of co-operation between Tusla and An Garda Síochána is simply breath-taking. Last week, we discussed the crisis in child and adolescent mental health services. This week it is a new set of scandals. What will be next week or the week after? This is not the first set of revelations about Tusla. It is the duty of the Taoiseach's Government to change that reality. The CEO of Tusla, Mr. Fred McBride, and Tusla must be held accountable. He should appear before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, should appear before the Dáil as quickly as possible to give the Government's response to this damning report.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The initial response of Tusla, apparently attempting to undermine Dr. Shannon, is totally and absolutely unacceptable. That is the knee-jerk reaction of most of the system in Ireland when criticised, whether by a whistleblower or the special rapporteur on child protection. It is to undermine the criticism first. My questions are very simple. Will the Taoiseach fully commit to ensuring 24-hour access to social workers throughout this State as an urgent priority? A total of 70% of the children taken in under section 12 were cases the gardaí were already aware of. Will the Taoiseach ensure that these cases are immediately followed up on to ensure the welfare of these children, including the children at the centre of the "RTE Investigates" programme? Will he initiate a whole-of-Government response, rather than just a ministerial response, to this scandal, including an audit like that carried out by Dr. Shannon being conducted across the entire child protection system?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I cannot disagree with the central issue of Deputy Adams's comments. This has to be about accountability and not about zero accountability. The Child and Family Agency was set up for a particular purpose as part of the response of Government to placing children and children's voices at the centre of Irish society, with a senior Ministry and Department dedicated directly to children. There was a referendum on children's rights and there is legislation, dealing which issues from sexual abuse to marriage equality, which have covered issues of family and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The report by Dr. Shannon speaks for itself. It is a very good report, a damning report and a very clear report. He has made 27 recommendations, which must and will be followed through on. The Minister will meet the Minister for Justice and Equality to address the issue of communication between Tusla and An Garda Síochána. As Deputy Adams is aware, section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 is an essential mechanism under which An Garda Síochána performs its child protection function and is only used as a measure of last resort. The Garda Commissioner must respond to the report in respect of the training of gardaí, including training for diversity, and the PULSE system and the deficiencies identified therein. Deputies will recall that the Government has already dedicated substantial resources for investment in Garda IT infrastructure. A total of €330 million, including €205 million in the capital plan, will be provided between 2016 and 2021. Members will appreciate that the design, commissioning and the delivery of such a large-scale IT project takes time and we must get it right in the first place. </p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The report comments on deficiencies in child protection training for gardaí, which is very concerning and needs to be seriously addressed. While the design of course provision is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance, I am advised that the current Garda student and probationer training programme incorporates modules that address issues like sexual assault and the Children First guidelines. The extent to which the existing training programme should be expanded or amended on foot of Dr. Shannon's recommendations must be addressed by the Garda Commissioner and An Garda Síochána in their response to his report. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> While acknowledging the serious issues raised for An Garda Síochána in the report, it is worth noting that there have been a number of important developments in Garda structures, including the establishment of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and the creation of the divisional protective services units. I am advised that it is also proposed to create a national child protection unit within An Garda Síochána so some things are happening. My answer to Deputy Adams's question about whether this will receive a whole-of-Government response is "Yes". The answer to the question about whether we will undertake to fulfil the 17 recommendations made by Dr. Shannon is also "Yes". </p>

          <p eId="para_21">I thank the Taoiseach for his answer. What we need now are results. In 2012, the people of this State voted to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution. Sinn Féin and others canvassed in that campaign. I met many people who were sceptical because they did not trust the State. If the Constitution is to have any value for these children, the Government must acknowledge that it is failing them and failing in our constitutional obligations to them. I understand that the issues involved go back a long time. The Taoiseach inherited this problem. He did not create it. In the past, this State outsourced its responsibilities to churches, religious orders and other institutions. This is clearly no longer acceptable and the Taoiseach played his part in that. Popular outrage is the guarantee that this will never happen again but we should not lose our sense of popular outrage. Outsourcing the responsibility for children, particularly vulnerable children, to private for-profit companies should be equally unacceptable. At the time that Tusla was established, we warned that without adequate resources, capacity and a change in culture, the initiative would fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Our child protection system is broken and is essentially dysfunctional. I welcome the Taoiseach's straightforward answer to my questions but if we are not to be back here next year or the year after or if somebody other than the Taoiseach and I is not to be back here again looking at another report like this, the Taoiseach needs to initiate that full Government response to which he committed and a complete overhaul of the child protection system.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I did not have time to say it previously but the Garda Commissioner's modernisation and renewal programme from 2016 to 2021 and the policing plan for this year contain a commitment to implement a new Garda diversity and inclusion strategy. I understand that this is expected to be finalised shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I am advised that the new Garda strategy will embrace the recommendation from the Ombudsman for Children, arising from its review of the manner in which the Garda Síochána invoked its powers under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 with regard to two Roma children, which was an issue of national public discussion and concern some time ago. As part of this work, the Garda Síochána is committed to further training its workforce to develop its cultural competence in interacting with minority communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> I will finally say to the Deputy that in so far as my tenure continues here, I will see to it that this is initiated in respect of children. We have done so much in terms of preparations, and one of the central features of the child strategy issue has been the setting up of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla. We want to see that this is enabled to do its work properly and, as I said to Deputy Micheál Martin, the central issue here is about the protection of children, not the protection of jobs or the protection of a structure. I will see that this happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">I do not doubt the Taoiseach's sincerity on this issue, but I think all of us were shocked by the report of the special rapporteur on children and the screening last night by "RTE Investigates". It was a special broadcast looking at the case studies and findings of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon as well as the detail of yet another disturbing case in my own region, the south east. Dr. Geoffrey Shannon has found chronic systems failures in the functions of Tusla. He called for a change of culture across the entire child protection system. How many times have we heard the phrase "a change of culture" in the last few weeks? His words at a press conference yesterday sear into us, that there were children treated as human trash in some of these cases. It is beyond shocking. To read the case studies of the report is sobering and shocking. An intoxicated woman slapped her eight-month old baby in a fast food restaurant, threw the baby in the air and dragged the child across wet ground. Three young children, aged five, two and less than a year, were wandering around the streets unsupervised, narrowly avoiding being hit by traffic. Two children, aged two and six years, were unsupervised and watching television while their mother was out drinking. These are not the worst of the cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Taoiseach has said that the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is to meet the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to discuss inter-agency co-operation between gardaí and Tusla. That is one recommendation. Improving the sharing of information between the Garda and Tusla is welcome but it is not enough. I cannot accept the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone's assertion this morning that Tusla is fit for purpose. I do not believe anybody who watched the programme last night accepts that this is the current reality, whatever the potential of Tusla. My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has been calling for some time now for a comprehensive 24-hour social work service for children at risk. It is not a phone line, but a service that delivers the same protection for children as that which is delivered during normal office hours, and to every part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Will the Taoiseach commit to the delivery of such a 24-hour comprehensive service, and will he set out the timeline? I do not expect him to set out the timeline this minute, but will he commit to setting a timeline for the instigation of such a service? Will he make sure that all gardaí receive appropriate child care protection training? He mentioned that there is a new module in training in Templemore Garda training college now. What about the huge existing cohort of gardaí? Will they be retrained? Will the Taoiseach tell this House what other changes will be introduced, so that the referendum that we passed to vindicate the rights of children - we worked together in government to ask the people to support that - will become a reality and not merely an aspiration?</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I am not happy about the situation that has arisen here. I am pleased that Dr. Shannon's report is as authentic and straightforward as it is. Tusla was the agency that said that it would be a ferocious corporate parent, looking after children. There are clearly questions to be answered here as to what was happening with public time, public money and public employees when children, as identified in this programme, were in the situation and circumstances in which they found themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I thank Deputy Howlin for his comment about being serious about this. It is a case where this structure will, like all other structures, seek to defend itself. The result is that vulnerable children are in very serious circumstances in some cases. It is our responsibility to see that everything humanly possible is done to put that right and if that requires further answers from Tusla, then so be it. As I said to Deputy Martin, this is not about zero accountability; it is about full accountability in respect of the most important people in the country who are our children. I want to meet the principals involved here. I want to speak to Dr. Shannon and to Tusla. I also want to speak to both Ministers. We cannot have a situation where there is a lack of engagement between the authorities and the agencies involved, the Garda and Tusla.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I remember attending the launch of Tusla in Dublin Castle with the then Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we put forward the proposition that Tusla was a radical step forward in the protection of children. Dr. Shannon's report points out serious inadequacies and we have to deal with those. I undertake to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">In the history of the State - we celebrated the centenary of 1916 last year - our most grievous failing has been in the protection of children. That is why, in Government together, we looked at issues such as constitutional change, a Department for children and a Minister dedicated to children. All of those tasks were done, but have they brought about this cultural change we are talking about that will deliver meaningful protection for every child?</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I welcome what the Taoiseach has said in terms of him taking the initiative to talk to everybody. We need now to have that conversation here so that we have constant reporting, not only when issues arise and because we have asked the rapporteur or some agency to tell us about it. We should have constant reviews and discussions about how we implement all of these changes that we brought about. In many ways, changing the law, establishing a Department and even changing the Constitution is the easy bit.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I fully agree. It is about the change of the culture here. The culture has been one of defence and structural protection. The purpose and focus of Tusla was to deal with children and the protection of children and the care and the comfort and facilities for children. As Deputy Howlin rightly says, we should not have to wait for any rapporteur's report to know what is happening here. If there are inadequacies between the Garda communications and Tusla, then I will rectify that. If this requires regular political oversight and monitoring, let us rectify that. One cannot have children living in fear in urine-soaked clothes in situations where they deserve the protection and the support of the State. There is nothing more important than this.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> I thank Dr. Shannon for his report, but let us see that the 17 recommendations are implemented. I will be speaking to both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but also to Tusla. I am not happy about this. It goes to the central issue here. This is about changing a culture from one of protection of structure and jobs to one of protection of children.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_36">Former Garda press officer, Superintendent Dave Taylor, claims that he sent a text to the Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan, some years ago in which he told her that a journalist had interviewed a person making allegations against Maurice McCabe. Superintendent Taylor claims Commissioner O'Sullivan sent a one-word reply, "Perfect." We are told now that Commissioner O'Sullivan's phone from that time has gone missing and cannot be provided to the Charleton tribunal - perfect. Superintendent Taylor's phone has not been provided to the Charleton tribunal either. It was taken from him as part of an internal Garda investigation led by Commissioner O'Sullivan's husband and has not been returned to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Commissioner O' Sullivan's husband has Superintendent Taylor's phone and the Commissioner cannot find her own phone - perfect, again. A senior Garda source told <i>The Irish Times</i> that "A search of Garda headquarters has taken place in recent weeks to try to find the missing phones, but there is little hope of the material being found at this stage". I would say not. Was that phone officially reported missing? If so, when exactly? Was Martin Callinan's phone officially reported missing? If so, when exactly? I am given to understand that Nóirín O'Sullivan used a second personal phone, known as the "off-site" phone, for some Garda business. Has this phone been sought or has she lost it too?</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> More than 1,200 people at 100 sampling points in all constituencies were asked last Tuesday and Wednesday, before the story of the missing phones broke, whether Nóirín O'Sullivan should resign. A total of 57% said she should resign, 23% said she should not, while 19% expressed no opinion. This means that nearly three out of every four who expressed an opinion said that she should go. The people who are policed by An Garda Síochána, the people who pay their wages, have spoken decisively on this issue. The Government's failure to act reveals a huge democratic deficit on policing and threatens to open up a crisis of legitimacy for An Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_39"> There has been lots of talk this week about legacy. This is all part of the Taoiseach's legacy and it is far from perfect. Is the Taoiseach going to continue to keep the Garda Commissioner in her position and allow the further undermining of the Charleton tribunal? </p>

          <p eId="para_40">The central point the Deputy makes is that the Government has failed to act on this issue but I disagree. I believe that Mr. Justice Charleton is the most appropriate person to carry out the required investigation. He has already adopted an absolutely no-nonsense approach to dealing with the business before him. He has set out the timelines, the strategy and the focus of public hearings. Deputy Barry has come into this House with a report from a journalist that a phone is missing that was in the possession of the Garda Commissioner. I do not know whether that is true or whether it is an allegation that stands up but I expect that Mr. Justice Charleton will find out the truth of that. He has already pointed out that public hearings on this matter will take place in July. Obviously he is a person of long experience, having worked on the Morris tribunal and having dealt with matters as complex as this in the past. He is the very best person to deal with the matter. I reject the Deputy's assertion that the Government has not done anything about this. The Government has set up a full formal commission of investigation under a very competent sole member to deal with the matter. The terms of reference of the tribunal are comprehensive and Mr. Justice Charleton will not stand on ceremony in getting to the truth of the issue. I would be loath to accept what the Deputy has said because I do not have any idea whether it is true. It is an allegation and a report. I would much prefer to leave the determination of the facts and the truth to Mr. Justice Charleton. I have every faith that he will discharge his duties and responsibilities to the utmost level of satisfaction.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">Perhaps the Taoiseach might ask the Garda Commissioner about the phone, try to establish the position and then let the House know.

In that report, the sole member outlined the parties who have been granted representation before the tribunal. They include Sergeant Maurice McCabe; Superintendent David Taylor, who is a former Garda press officer; the Garda Commissioner; and the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan. According to the interim report, the Garda Commissioner and the former Garda Commissioner have agreed to waive privilege in respect of records in their possession. A slate of public hearings on this matter will be held in July of this year under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Charleton. That is the place where the accuracy, the veracity and the truth will be established. The matters presented here by Deputy Barry, on the basis of a journalist's report or whatever, will then be established beyond "Yea" or "Nay".

          <p eId="para_73">It not agreed. On No. 4a, the terms of reference for dealing with the eighth amendment of the Constitution, the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, as will the Chief Whip, there was quite a debate about this at the Business Committee and our representative, Deputy Boyd Barrett, indicated that we disagreed with the disallowing of substitution on this committee and sought a debate on it. We would like this House to debate that change of Standing Orders, not least because it has quite a serious impact on the extent to which new politics applies in this House because it will hit Senators and Deputies who have a track record of fighting on the issue of abortion rights and for a pro-repeal stance disproportionately as against the way it will affect the larger parties. Some of the larger parties struggled to find people to sit on that committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> On an obvious point, substitution needs to be allowed because a Member could become ill, have a family disaster or fall under a bus and need to have a substitute on the committee. This issue is not so simple as the Business Committee portrays it to be. There should be room for a debate in the House, otherwise what does new politics mean if we cannot reflect it in terms of how we deal with this issue? Members of the Civic Engagement group in the Seanad are also very concerned about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">Please accept the basic parameters of a parliamentary democracy that when people stand up to speak, they are allowed to. I did not interfere with anybody or interrupt anybody on that side of the House when they spoke. I agree with the order of the Business Committee. There must be some degree of certainty and solidity about our work. If a recommendation comes from the Business Committee to proceed in a certain manner, we should take the vote. We cannot just have four or five people standing up every week and saying that because they do not agree with the order, we will not proceed. We are trying to accommodate every nuance and position. Being thrown under a bus in the political world is a regular occupational hazard.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">There is a commitment in the programme for Government that Ireland will play a part in promoting fundamental human rights, the rule of law and religious freedom across the globe through the European Union and the United Nations. We all agree with that commitment and, by and large, our diplomats have been very effective in promoting these objectives. However, every Deputy is equally clear and deeply concerned about the denial of fundamental human rights to Ibrahim Halawa, particularly now that his case has been deferred yet again. This is the 24th time his case has been deferred, which is a shocking undermining of his basic human rights and exceptionally unfair, given all of the previous commitments to allow the trial to proceed. His ongoing detention without trial and treatment while in prison speak to the core of the objective of the programme for Government. In that context, when did the Taoiseach last speak to the Prime Minister of Egypt about progressing matters for Ibrahim Halawa? Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade sought to utilise the European Union and the United Nations to make combined efforts to secure justice in this case and bring some solace to Ibrahim Halawa's very frustrated family who feel helpless in the face of ongoing events.</p>

The Cabinet made a decision to send an Irish medical doctor to Egypt to assess Ibrahim Halawa's health. I will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring the Deputy up to date on the latest position.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I agree with the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. The delay is worrying and the continuing detention of our citizen is unfair and unjust. On the specific questions posed by the Deputy, I raised the issue only last week at EU level with a number of EU foreign affairs colleagues, as well as with High Representative Mogherini and expressed the concern of the Irish people and Government. I meet on a weekly basis with the Egyptian ambassador who is in no doubt about the Government's position on the issue. I am concerned about the further adjournment until 4 July, but the reason for such a lengthy adjournment is Ramadan. In Egypt the courts do not as a rule sit during that season. In the meantime, the welfare and health of our citizen are very much to the fore and we are making representations and monitoring the position on a daily basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">Those who made submissions or gave evidence did a sterling job. Our policy goes further than the report, but I warmly welcome its publication because it commits to a public health service. There have been numerous reports on our health services and Governments of the day have refused to implement them. Members of the committee were part of those Governments at that time. This report will be no different unless a government implements it. The recommendations include an implementation committee, answerable to the Taoiseach as well as to the Minister for Health, and a Cabinet subcommittee. I do not know whether the Taoiseach has had a chance to be briefed or to read the report, but will he look positively at the report and will he commit to it?</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I have not had time to read it, but I expect there should be an early debate on it in the House. The important thing is there is cross-party political consensus on the main issues in the report, and from a politician's perspective, this is an important element which we have not had before. I commend the members of the committee, who have worked to remove elements of the health system from becoming political footballs. It is a matter of assessing the full report and having a debate on it here and, in so far as possible, following through on it. We will do this and come back into the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">Since the formation of the Government we have listened to the Minister, Deputy Ross, pontificate about the dramatic reforms he proposes in the appointment of the Judiciary. It is no exaggeration to say he seems obsessed with an area for which he has no ministerial responsibility. Many of us may have concerns about what he proposes, but we will debate it when it actually happens. Having listened to plenty of hyperbole from the Minister, Deputy Ross, over the past year <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> made for staggering reading this week. We discovered that in advance of the new system coming into play, the Minister, Deputy Ross, last week agreed to the appointment of a batch of new judges, including one for a vacancy which, we understand, will not arise until next November. Having acted as the arch critic of any Government interference or of a political fingerprint on the appointment of judges, apparently the only political interference to be allowed is his own. We read about his double standards in the newspaper. Apparently, not only did he determine who was to be appointed but, according to the report, he went through each of the appointments with a fine-tooth comb. Since the Minister, Deputy Ross, seems to think, like Donald Trump, that his vetting is non-political because he is a non-politician, will the Government continue with the new judicial appointment system or is the new Ross system to be the norm?</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I expect the Whip will bring in the new judicial appointments Bill on 20 June. Members will have different views on it, but it is agreed from a Government perspective. This is a radical departure bringing transparency, yet it retains the responsibility of Cabinet making decisions at Government level on judicial appointments and having a choice to do so. It is expected to be come in on 20 June and let see how it progresses. The intention is to have it resolved and put through before the summer recess, but this depends on the views of Deputies who comment.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_153">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to provide for improved health and safety standards in funfairs and for related matters. </p>
          <p eId="para_154">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this opportunity to introduce the Health and Safety (Funfair) (Amendment) Bill. Many people are aware that at this time of the year, particularly as we head into the holiday season and the season of long evenings, people will attend the theme parks and funfairs that operate throughout the country during the holiday period. A very informative and detailed RTE "Prime Time" programme screened recently brought this issue to my attention. The degree of regulation and oversight for members of the public in our theme parks and funfairs is pretty much negligible. The only oversight we have at present of parks and funfairs is that when they are being established they must apply for a safety certificate from the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The problem has to do with public safety. We have an issue with public safety, as was detailed in at least one case outlined in the RTE programme. If a member of the public is hurt, or has a concern about his or her own safety or the safety of any member of the public, in a theme park or funfair there is nowhere to go to ask for an issue to be investigated. The Bill sets out to amend the enabling legislation of the Health and Safety Authority to give it an oversight role in receiving and investigating complaints by users of funfairs and theme parks. It will be a new departure for the Health and Safety Authority. It will broaden its remit and give it the authority to receive such complaints and investigate them. With regard to it being a public safety initiative, it is something which will go a long way towards addressing some of the issues and concerns which have been brought to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> We met the showmen's guild, which is the umbrella group and representative association of the operators of funfairs and theme parks, and we received very constructive input from it. My colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, was instrumental in arranging the briefing session we had with it. The guild was quite happy with what we have set out in the legislation and with what we are trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The legislation is to broaden the remit of the Health and Safety Authority on a public safety initiative and I am offering it to the House on this basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_223"> As regards the meeting of 25 May, its purpose was to review the State's arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of a major terrorist attack.</p>
            <p eId="para_224"> As well as the Tánaiste and me, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment attended, with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and senior officials. The meeting was briefed on the current threat assessment by the security authorities. It was noted that while a terrorist attack was possible, it was unlikely and that there was no specific information on any threat to Ireland from international terrorism. This assessment will remain under continuous review. The authorities remain in daily contact with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the European Union and beyond. The Garda authorities, supported by the Defence Forces, are engaged in ongoing work aimed at preventing an attack taking place. Detailed preparations have also been made in the event of an attack. Other agencies also have plans in place to deal with the outcome of major incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_225"> Ministers were also briefed on the overall national emergency management arrangements, involving all of the agencies of the State, and how the arrangements would operate in the event of a major incident. The meeting was advised that the Garda authorities were working closely with event organisers to ensure appropriate safety and security measures were in place at major events. The Garda is asking the public to remain vigilant and report immediately any issue which gives rise to concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_226"> Of equal importance is ongoing work to ensure people do not become alienated from our society and radicalised. Terrorism is caused not by particular religions or peoples but by hatred. The aim of international terrorism is to change our way of life through creating fear. We cannot and will not allow that to happen. It is important that we abide by our values and continue to live our lives to the full in a free society.</p>

            <p eId="para_228">Accountability and transparency are essential ingredients of a well functioning democracy. National security issues, however, allow governments that are basically democratic to opt out of these responsibilities and justify actions which often constitute gross infringements of human rights under the guise of protecting citizens. Ireland's national security committee, NSC, by its nature, deals with sensitive information and intelligence on both dissident and international threats, some of which must be kept confidential for obvious reasons. However, the secrecy surrounding this organ of the State is unparalleled. Although operational matters regarding State security fall to various units within An Garda Síochána, the NSC dictates the State's response to issues of defence, intelligence and national security and advises the Government on them. All information on meetings of the NSC, including the dates of past meetings, is kept secret and the NSC answers to nobody but itself. The equivalent UK body reports directly to the Intelligence and Security Committee of the Westminster Parliament which was set up in 1994 and is responsible for the management and oversight of the policy on, administration and expenditure of all security services, including the Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, and provides for oversight of defence intelligence in the Ministry of Defence and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_229"> In June 2015 the Taoiseach admitted to the House that Ireland could not consider itself to be immune from international terrorist threats. However, at the same time he is happy to continue Ireland's complicity with the US military machine by allowing US aircraft operating in theatres of war to land at Shannon Airport and overfly Irish airspace. Some of these aircraft are even thought to have stopped at Shannon Airport while on rendition flights. Permitting US aircraft to use Shannon Airport unchecked is a tacit declaration of support for the United States' murderous policies in the Middle East. This breach of our neutrality is surely a prime reason Ireland might be seen as a target for international terrorism. Does the Taoiseach think we should re-think allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base?</p>

            <p eId="para_230">My question is about the mechanisms for oversight of the national security committee because while there is an understandable need for confidentiality, it must be balanced with proper accountability mechanisms. Will the Taoiseach outline the accountability and scrutiny mechanisms in place for overseeing the role of the national security committee? Does the committee share or authorise the sharing of intelligence information with other governments? Is anybody politically responsible for clearing it? There has been some speculation about the possibility of establishing an overarching, more structured agency with responsibility for security. Willl the Taoiseach give us an update?</p>

            <p eId="para_231">I wish to focus on the security of the State in the light of some of the comments made last week after the horrific bombing in Manchester. It would be extremely naive to think this country could not possibly be the site of an attack. We must have a proper debate about these matters. To put it bluntly, the notion that there is a secret committee examining and hearing about threats to the State is fine, but there must be some democratic exchange about these matters, either through a committee of the House or the briefing of leaders. Some mechanism must be found. We have moved into a new space. For example, have efforts been made to assess the number of people moving from conflict zones back to Ireland? How do we identify such persons? Are they monitored in Ireland?</p>
            <p eId="para_232"> During my period in government I recall that when I introduced Estimates, there was always a Secret Service Vote. It was a matter of conjecture what that Vote was. It was always for a token sum of €1 million, a relatively small sum of money. Do we have a Vote for a proper intelligence service? To pick up on the last question asked by Deputy Gerry Adams, the last time we held this discussion in the House, I raised the need for a separate intelligence security unit. There are two reasons, one of which is that we are now in a different space or paradigm. Second, cyber security is an area into which we must put effort and resources. We saw what happened - I am not saying it was a cyber attack -- when there was a breakdown in a computer system at British Airways which crippled that enormous company worldwide. Are we protected against cyber attacks? We must have such capacity, but I am not sure we have. Will the Taoiseach give his views on the matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_233">I agree that there is a need for greater democratic involvement in, and oversight of, what we are doing in this area. There is an immediate question that requires an answer. How will we co-operate with the UK Government in the post-Brexit era if we are to have a common travel area? It was reported, although it is only conjecture at this stage, that one of the people detained after the bombing in Manchester last week had spent some time in Ireland. That will continue post-Brexit. I also recall reading in some of the British media last weekend that one of the concerns post-Brexit was that the sharing of intelligence information with European colleagues would be increasingly difficult. What is the mechanism post-Brexit for us to share security information with the British Government, especially given that we have a common travel area and such strong connections? I also call on the Taoiseach to provide for the wider involvement of Members of the House in overseeing what our security officials are doing in this regard. It is important that it not be done in secret. Obviously, one understands the need for secrecy, but there is a requirement for democratic oversight, as occurs at Westminster but not here.</p>

            <p eId="para_234">The most important matter is the narrative for how we describe acts of terrorism. There can never be any justification - I do not quite agree with Deputy Mick Wallace's perspective - for slaughtering innocents and civilians in the manner in which they were slaughtered in Manchester. We have had experience of this in the past. The IRA campaign of bombing civilians was no different from what we witnessed in Manchester last week, including the bombings in Birmingham, Enniskillen and at La Mon. There can be no moral equivocation about which is worse. The fundamental difference between the two is that, in the case of the IRA, in motst cases the perpetrators made sure that they got away before many civilians were brutally slain for no justifiable reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_235"> I agree with Deputy Brendan Howlin that we cannot be complacent. We are a soft target, like many others. The <i>raison d'être</i> of ISIS operators is to hit where they can and to hit the softest target they possibly can. In the past, owing to what happened in Northern Ireland because of the IRA's campaign, we had much stronger security capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">That is my sense of it. Since the peace process, we have lost a lot of corporate intelligence and so on. We really need to recreate it in the context of the ISIS threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_237"> On the issue of having a separate crime and security agency, the Kathleen O'Toole commission should be asked to ascertain the optimal approach for us to intelligence and security. The battle against ISIS and others is about trying to counter extremism on the ground and in communities, which is very important, and also about having deep and good intelligence to avert atrocities. Are Irish citizens who return having fought in Iraq or Syria on behalf of ISIS tracked? Is there any penalty for those who participate with ISIS overseas? Are they just allowed back into the country? The Minister for Justice and Equality said in answering questions that it was known that up to 30 people had participated in Syria and Iraq. Can they just fly back in with no penalties? Do our laws need to be overhauled in that regard? We have to have zero tolerance of anybody who participates in such activity overseas and who has the freedom to come back and carry on as if life were normal.</p>

            <p eId="para_238">In the aftermath of the dreadful events in Manchester, are there plans for a national intelligence agency? What would be the cost of such an agency? We are all aware that many reports are being produced and that many commissions are working on various elements of An Garda Síochána. Is this one of the issues that will be examined?</p>
            <p eId="para_239"> Deputy Enda Kenny, as the outgoing Taoiseach, may be very well placed to offer some insights, in the context of his experience as Taoiseach, into what would be the optimum. We hear a lot of dissatisfaction being expressed about how protected Ireland is. We hear suggestions of inadequate resources at various points at ports and airports. In my constituency and most of the Leinster region there is a very high number of people from other countries, which is very good. We also know that we have a very significant Libyan population living in Ireland. There should be more focus on integration, particularly of young people, in schools and colleges and, in particular, our efforts to ensure they do as well as possible in the school system and will also have opportunities to engage in further education and employment. Otherwise, we could end up with people with great hopes but who are left outside our systems, as happens in other countries. Therein lies the danger.</p>

            <p eId="para_240">This is probably one of the most serious matters that can ever be considered here. There are some things one can say and some things one cannot say. Facilities at Shannon Airport have been used for many years by members of the US Air Force, but I have no evidence of rendition flights through it. Deputy Mick Wallace has been there on a number of occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_241"> Deputy Gerry Adams has stated we cannot consider ourselves to be immune. That is true and there is no complacency. The weapons of bombers have changed and are changing. Clearly, the incidents in France, Belgium, Berlin and Sweden lead us to believe this. There is now the capacity to take remote control of a vehicle and drive it at speed into a crowd of people, with or without a driver. More primitive weapons are being used to carry out the same destruction, leading to international incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_242"> The question of having a separate security group or force has been raised. I am not sure we want an MI5 or an MI6 here, but the O'Toole commission which is examining the structure, policing and security matters, as raised by Deputies Mícheál Martin, Brendan Howlin and Joan Burton, can consider the matter in a way which allows us to reflect a very dangerous and changing world. </p>
            <p eId="para_243"> As Deputy Mícheál Martin is aware, the Defence Forces obviously have intelligence available to them on small numbers of people who might be in the country for purposes other than peaceful living. They are under review on a constant basis. That intelligence is made available to the Garda and shared on a very regular basis. Clearly, the Garda and the security forces generally are in constant touch, or daily contact, with Britain, the rest of Europe and beyond, where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> Deputy Mícheál Martin referred to the slaughter of innocent victims. While all cases are tragic, one of the differences is that suicide bombers want to be blown up. The Provisional IRA did not want that to happen. It caused the same destruction and no warnings were given and people suffered tragic consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> The preparations for a serious incident here have covered and do cover a range of options, about which I cannot speak. No matter where one puts the cordon of security, however, people have to gather outside it to get in and these are always issues of grave concern. I expect the O'Toole commission to examine the issue of security or a security element-----</p>

            <p eId="para_247">As the Deputy is aware, we have had enough discussion here about the structure of the Garda to get it right. If there is to be a second element, which may well be worthwhile, that is another matter. I do not want to prejudge the expertise available to the O'Toole commission. The evolution through the independent Policing Authority and the changes with GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate will all lead to a change in culture in the Garda over a number of years. Whether it would be right to have a second intelligence and security element is a matter I do not want to prejudge, but it is working well in other countries. We have had our own system. Obviously, there have been inadequacies that we are trying to rectify.</p>
            <p eId="para_248"> Radicalisation has been mentioned. It is not a religious issue. The Garda has the capacity to engage with different and diverse communities to understand what is happening and what is likely to be of interest to us. There is a lot of activity in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_249"> Deputy Mícheál Martin mentioned people coming back to Ireland having fought with ISIS. As I said, there is a small number of people in the country who are certainly under scrutiny. </p>
            <p eId="para_250"> Deputy Joan Burton raised the question of having an intelligence agency. It will certainly be an element of the focus of the O'Toole commission. I do not want to prejudge it. Let us get the system we have in place right. I assure Members that at the meeting I attended with representatives of the Garda, the Defence Forces and the health, transport and aviation sectors they informed me that they were all very active in looking out for potential incidents that might occur here. The sharing of information is important. It is quite complex and very complicated in terms of the information stored on servers here with major companies. Privacy and the protection of data are very strongly valued by them, yet we have to share information with our UK colleagues who might see potential terrorists passing through Britain, including to case a place with the intention of carrying out an incident later. That is a matter we have to deal with through legislation, which is very complicated. At the same time, we have to and do share information on potential terrorists with our colleagues across the water. That is an issue that is being focused on by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

            <p eId="para_260"> In A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government stated its intention to reform Seanad Éireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the report of the working group on Seanad reform, the Manning report. That report was published in 2015 and is available on the Department's website. One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the report. </p>
            <p eId="para_261"> As I said previously, I agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by Deputy Micheál Martin that this group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the Dáil and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required. I wrote to party leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to this approach and their intention to participate. Contacts are still continuing with parties to finalise nominations with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_262">Would I be right in suspecting that of all things, the Taoiseach will forget most quickly and with the least amount of regret the different questions about Seanad Éireann? I know that Mr. Maurice Manning chaired of the implementation group. The group carried out a very detailed report and everything like that. Now we apparently have an implementation plan. From a human point of view, I think we all understand the Taoiseach's reluctance. I am sure that whoever his successor is will go at the Seanad with great gusto. In the meantime, could the Taoiseach possibly update us on where matters stand at this point in time? Is there anything else that he would like to see Seanad Éireann do now that it is available as part of the democratic process, notwithstanding the fact that the Taoiseach once had some ideas to the contrary?</p>

            <p eId="para_263">As the Taoiseach has said, it is almost ten months since he wrote to the party leaders on the make-up of the implementation group. He also went on to say, if I got it right, that contact continues with the party leaders about the chair. That is news to me and, by the response of the other leaders in the House, it must be news to them as well. Therefore, it is two years since the Manning report on Seanad reform was published. The Taoiseach has not even agreed who the chair of the implementation group will be. At the time, we welcomed the Government's commitment to the Manning recommendations. It was also about the right to vote in Seanad elections for citizens in the North and the diaspora. That reflects, as the Taoiseach knows, the views of the Constitutional Convention of September 2013. However, like other issues, this is a mark of the paralysis of this Government. Before the Taoiseach leaves office, perhaps he could appoint someone to chair the implementation group on Seanad reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_264">In a bout of complete honesty, perhaps the Taoiseach will admit that nothing has happened with this set of proposals and nothing is intended to happen with them. I would like to ask a few very direct questions. Is it the fixed Government position that the Manning proposals are the blueprint for what should happen into the future? If the answer to that question is "Yes", why has no action been taken to begin the process of implementation? Will there be any changes in the structure of the Seanad or in the electoral process to elect the next Seanad before the next general election?</p>

            <p eId="para_267">Which political party has not sent in its names? Could the Taoiseach identify who has not responded to his request? We wrote back on 2 December with three names. Has the Fine Gael party finalised its nominees? There has been a kind of silence for the last couple of months. I note from previous meetings that we had during the last Government that the Taoiseach was, to be fair, decidedly unenthusiastic about the whole project. I heard recently that the former Senator, Mr. Maurice Manning, is a good cordial friend of the Taoiseach's and has had the occasional pint with the Taoiseach. He never mentioned anything to do with politics when he had the odd pint with the Taoiseach but one would have thought that the old matter of the implementation of the Manning report might have surfaced as one pint turned to two or maybe even three. I thought it might have been slipped in at some stage. In a serious vein, we are all committed to it. We have compromised. Our position was for a stronger mass electorate but we accepted the Manning compromise. It can be facilitated through legislation. Everyone in the House wants it to happen. As one of the Taoiseach's final acts before he hands on to his successor, perhaps he might get it up and running and get it formed.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_281">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 17, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> I met with Mr. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit, in Government Buildings on Thursday 11 May. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister of State for European affairs. The meeting provided an opportunity, following the European Council's adoption of the EU negotiating guidelines and in advance of agreement on the more detailed negotiating directives, to thank Mr. Barnier for his openness to Ireland in relation to our particular concerns arising from Brexit and to highlight our thoughts about the process ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> We discussed the serious implications in relation to peace and stability in Northern Ireland and the Border, and for the Irish economy, particularly the fisheries and agrifood sector. I commended Mr. Barnier on his address to the Oireachtas that morning and expressed confidence in his ability to negotiate on behalf of the EU 27 and to take account of Ireland's particular concerns. </p>
            <p eId="para_284"> Mr. Barnier stressed the complexities of the issues involved in the negotiations and outlined his intention to be firm but fair. He committed to ensuring that the task force remains accessible to all Member States and especially to Ireland, given our unique concerns. </p>
            <p eId="para_285"> There is ongoing daily engagement on Brexit and on other EU issues between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, indeed, with the permanent representation in Brussels and our network of missions across the EU, with a view to ensuring a comprehensive approach to EU affairs. There is also of course ongoing interaction across all Government Departments on the range of EU issues, including through regular meetings of the senior officials group on the EU and the inter-departmental group on Brexit, which is chaired by the second Secretary General in my Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_286"> This is consistent with the approach set out in my Department's statement of strategy, which identified the need for a whole-of-government approach to the Brexit negotiations. </p>
            <p eId="para_287"> The second Secretary General also acts as Ireland's sherpa and, in this capacity, meets and engages regularly with his EU counterparts. Since the triggering of Article 50 on 29 March, there have been two formal sherpa meetings under the Article 50 format, one on 11 April and another on 24 April. Ireland participated fully in both of these. </p>
            <p eId="para_288"> The discussions focused on the EU negotiating guidelines, which were subsequently agreed by the European Council on 29 April. </p>
            <p eId="para_289"> The negotiations on Brexit, which will be conducted by the Commission, will be guided by the European Council in its Article 50 format, that is, the heads of state and government of the 27 member states. </p>
            <p eId="para_290"> In addition, Ministers at the General Affairs Council now also discuss issues relating to Brexit in the Article 50 format.</p>
            <p eId="para_291">At official level, the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, COREPER, and the new working party are also meeting at 27 to discuss issues relating to Brexit. COREPER meets on a weekly basis. The new working party first met on 23 May and it is expected to meet twice a week from now on. Of course, there are also daily meetings of working groups on the full range of EU issues and these groups include representatives of all member states, including Ireland. </p>

            <p eId="para_295">The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, is again referencing a hard Brexit or indeed no deal if the British fail to get a deal from their discussions. This makes the decision of the Government, if the Taoiseach can confirm it, to sell off a significant portion of AIB for something like €3 billion and apply that €3 billion under the un-amended fiscal rules to the writing down of something like a point on the national debt all the more extraordinary. This is an entirely futile exercise in the context of the economy growing and the debt reducing. In his discussions with Michel Barnier, did the Taoiseach look for special arrangements relating to Ireland in the case of no deal or a very difficult Brexit whereby we would get additional resources and a specific change in the fiscal rules? The Government has put forward the barmy idea of using the AIB money to unnecessarily pay down the national debt instead of investing in our roads, public transport, schools, housing and hospitals. The Government's decision is mind boggling and a disgraceful use of resources the Irish people paid for at great cost.</p>

            <p eId="para_296">Yesterday, Michel Barnier published two documents relating to Brexit negotiations. The first deals with essential principles on citizens' rights and covers the protection of EU citizens' rights and British nationals following Brexit. This is the one on which I will concentrate. The paper on citizens' rights sets out the protections EU wants to secure for nearly 5 million people who will be affected by Brexit, including Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. The document stresses that the European Court of Justice must have full jurisdiction for ruling on disputes about citizens' rights while the European Commission ought to have full powers for monitoring whether the British Government is upholding that part of the bargain. The British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, has already railed against this. Can the Taoiseach confirm when the Irish Government will discuss these papers with our EU partners and whether the Government has any amendments or proposed amendments to these papers? According to the EU, further policy papers are expected in the next few days. Will the Government agree to distribute all such papers? Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, has called for a referendum on a united Ireland following Brexit. Will the Taoiseach join me in welcoming this?</p>

            <p eId="para_297">The Government promised to publish a new paper on economic and tax issues relating to Brexit. When will we see this publication? I have a brief question relating to the very worrying position that was repeated last night in the British general election debate that the likely outcome of the hard line taken by the UK will be no deal. Have our officials produced any scoping of what the consequences of this scenario will be? In respect of the UK declaration that it also wants to hold on to the EU agencies currently sited in the UK, is this a possibility? What is the formal view of this Government and the EU in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_298">My question was not about Michel Barnier but the level of meetings that have been held between Irish officials and their counterparts in other member states. Since I posed that question, new information has emerged from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the number of officials. It turns out that when we look at the number of officials who have been hired, we can see that we have hired less than one quarter of the allocation. The allocation was not enough to begin with. IDA Ireland was allocated ten Brexit staff but it turns out that it has hired one. Enterprise Ireland was allocated 39 Brexit staff but has hired just 12. Science Foundation Ireland was allocated three but has yet to hire a single person. The Health and Safety Authority was allocated two but has yet to hire a single person. Of the 54 Brexit officials the Government has given sanction to hire, only 13 have been hired. This is less than one quarter. As Deputy Howlin pointed out, we are moving closer and closer to no deal and need to start scenario planning around what a cliff would look like. Can the Taoiseach tell the House why, given the severity of Brexit and the mounting materiality of Ireland hitting a cliff, the State agencies tasked with dealing with this have hired less than one quarter of the already insufficient allocation they were given?</p>

            <p eId="para_299">I appreciate that the Government has published the document entitled "Ireland and the negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union - The Government's Approach". This document sets out the sectoral consequences of Brexit. The list is endless with regard to agriculture; fishing rights; trade issues generally; transport and aviation; tourism; health, including treatment abroad; education, including the recognition of qualifications; financial services; data protection; global security; the common travel area, including social welfare and pension rights; the single electricity market; used car imports; cross-Border crime; and research and development. On and on it goes. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there is co-ordination between Departments? Even at this late stage, does he not think we need a Brexit Minister to co-ordinate the response across Government Departments and among the different sectors affected by Brexit?</p>

            <p eId="para_304">I would like to be heard. We all know Theresa May is an absolute horror who is trying to use the exit vote to pursue her little Englander, anti-immigrant, hard-line austerity agenda. However, when Monsieur Barnier was here, he gave fairly strong indications that the EU is also going to play political games on the issue of exit - talking about how there must be consequences for exiting the EU. I put it to the Taoiseach that between the horror of Theresa May and the politicking of the EU, this country is piggy in the middle in a political game between these two blocs. The question is whether the Taoiseach is going to stand up to this politicking and demand that we have a say in whatever deal or arrangement they come up with. It is clear that neither Theresa May nor the EU gives a damn, or are cavalier, about the consequences of their approach to the exit negotiations on this country. They clearly do not give a hoot about the Border or the common travel area and are playing politics. Are we going to demand a referendum on the final deal? I ask this question very seriously. Are we going to demand a veto on any deal they hatch or that impacts on us and does not suit us in respect of the issues on which there is consensus North and South?</p>

            <p eId="para_305">Monsieur Barnier made it very clear when he was here that while there would be flexibility on the issue of the movement of people on this island and indeed between Ireland and the rest of the UK, there would be no movement or even talks in the first stage of talks about the issue of trade in services and goods between ourselves, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_306">Does the Taoiseach agree that there are no negotiations in the first phase about how we deal with trade of goods and services? Given that the British Prime Minister again last night went back to the "no deal is better than a bad deal" scenario, will the Taoiseach or his successor insist that this issue - that the UK Secretary of State, Mr. David Davis says is going to be the row of the summer - should be raised at the June council on 22 June so that we can have our Irish interests represented immediately rather than waiting for events to unfold? Will the Taoiseach put trade issues with regard to the Border on the June council agenda, or would he recommend his successor do so, to ensure that they are not ignored?</p>

            <p eId="para_307">Deputy Burton raised the question of AIB. The Minister for Finance has taken a lead role on this. Under EU fiscal rules, the proceeds of any sale may not be used to fund increased expenditure irrespective of whether such expenditure is classified as current or as capital. On the accounting treatment of any proceeds from such a transaction, the position is that the sale of such financial assets does not result in a beneficial impact to the general Government balance under EUROSTAT rules. This is because it is classified as a financial transaction whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of assets, such as shares, for another kind, such as cash. Consequently, the sale of any share-holding in a bank would not count as general Government revenue, and would not create any scope for increased spending on the basis of the proceeds that are realised. There will be no increased capacity for spending following any sale of bank shares. The Minister for Finance will make his decision on this matter in the next 48 hours.</p>

A lower debt level is not only beneficial for the fiscal sustainability of the State, but will also lead to reduced interest payments in future years. It is crucial that increases in funding for public investment are based on sustainable economic growth, and the Government is well aware of the challenges that arose in the past when one-off amounts of money were used to fund ongoing commitments to the State.</p>

I do not believe that the conditions are right for it at the moment but I was happy that the European Council reflected carefully on the visionaries who put their words together on the Good Friday Agreement such that, if that process ever happens and people decide to have a democratic vote by consent to join the Republic, the entire island becomes a full member of the European Union, irrespective of the decision to leave as part of Britain under the Brexit negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_316"> Deputy Brendan Howlin raised the question of the EU agencies here. Clearly, Ireland has applied for both of them, as other countries have. These are European agencies that will be based in a European country. We are competing with Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Luxembourg for the financial one and with other countries for the medical agency and we will compete strongly for those. We tick many of the relevant boxes. That will eventually be decided by the European Council, probably in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_317"> Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly raised the level of meetings in the negotiations. These negotiations have not begun at all yet. All we are doing is setting out the strategy and groundwork, and we have those principles established. When the Deputy says that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have not taken up all of the approved numbers, they will be employed as needs be, and outside expertise will be employed if necessary. The negotiations have not begun in detail yet. The Deputy also spoke about what he termed "mounting materiality", which is not a common phrase used down in the country, I have to say.<b>
							</b> In any event, there is a daily contact going on about all of these issues. As needs be, the staff and personnel will be recruited, and if expertise is needed, that will also be recruited.</p>
            <p eId="para_318"> Deputy Seán Haughey mentioned co-ordination between Departments. There is co-ordination on a daily basis. On having a Minister with responsibility for Brexit, I made the point before that the decisions are made by the European Council. If a Brexit Minister was appointed, he or she could not even attend the General Affairs Council, which makes the initial preparatory decisions before they go to the European Council. Let us say that Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett becomes the Brexit Minister, he cannot attend the General Affairs Council, he cannot attend at the European Council-----</p>

Ireland has a veto, along with every other country if they so wish, and that is contained clearly within the rules and regulations. If at the end of the day, when it is all over and done with, and a proposition comes - the European Parliament will have its say - to the European Council, if Ireland is not in agreement, Ireland has a veto, the same as everybody else-----</p>

            <p eId="para_348">As of 26 May, there were almost 80,000 passport applications in the processing system. Of these, approximately 34,000 were first-time applications and 46,000 were renewals.</p>
            <p eId="para_349"> The turnaround time for online applications is 10 working days plus postage. The target turnaround time for Passport Express renewal applications is 15 working days and this is currently being met. The target turnaround time for first-time applications and applications for renewal of lost, stolen or damaged passports through Passport Express is 20 working days. These categories of application take longer due to the extra security checks involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_350">The average turnaround time for these applications is currently 24 working days. This is mainly as a result of the exceptionally large volume of applications in the processing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> As more applicants use the online passport application service, the efficiency gains will help improve turnaround times more broadly. I urge all Deputies to promote the use of this service to all adults who qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> I take the opportunity also to reiterate how important it is that applicants choose the most appropriate application channel, depending on their individual circumstances. The Passport Express option should only be used by those who are travelling in three weeks or more. Anyone renewing a passport who needs to travel in under three weeks should make an appointment online to apply in person at the Passport Office, in either Dublin or Cork. Naturally, there is a limited number of such appointments available and it is important that we collectively promote best practice and encourage citizens to check their passport is in date before booking travel. It is considered best practice to allow six weeks for a passport application, as difficulties can arise where an application is incomplete or where further information is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_353"> My Department provides a free renewal reminder email service and I ask Deputies to join me in promoting the use of this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_354"> All applicants are advised on notes accompanying the passport application form to check current turnaround times online on the website of my Department. These are updated on a weekly basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_355">I thank the Minister. I commend the staff in the Passport Office who are under severe pressure and who are doing their level best to deal with the increased demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> The Minister may have heard the Irish ambassador to Britain, H.E. Mr. Dan Mulhall, earlier today talking about the dramatic increase in passport applications from the United Kingdom. There was a 9% increase last year, year on year. It is probably projected to increase further.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> I met the head of the Passport Service quite recently. I want to know does the Passport Office have the resources it needs. Is the Minister confident that they have the manpower and systems in place? I note the online renewal and online passport application has been successful in the short time since it has been launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> Like all other Deputies and the Minister, I receive on a daily basis calls from distressed citizens whose passports will not be available in time for them to travel. It is particularly stressful. There are families paying a lot of money for probably the one holiday they will get each year. Has there been any thought of looking at changing the application in so far as those with travel documents are concerned as opposed to the increase in applications coming in from Britain merely to have the passport but not necessarily with a need to travel? Is the Minister looking at any changes in procedures at present and will we be able to continue to cope with the increased demand?</p>

            <p eId="para_359">I recognise this is an ongoing challenge of significant dimensions having regard to issues as raised by Deputy Darragh O'Brien. A total of 75,145 applications have come from Northern Ireland and almost 70,000 from Great Britain between 25 June last year and 29 May this year. This is an increase of 50% from Northern Ireland and 55% from Great Britain over that period. I keep the situation under review at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> I welcome suggestions from Deputies. I was pleased to have the matter introduced by way of discussion at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> We have taken on new staff. As of January this year, 301 permanent full-time equivalent staff were assigned to the Passport Service. This is up 272 full-time equivalent staff from January 2015. To assist with strong seasonal demand from April to July, we have almost 230 temporary clerical officers in place. The matter remains under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_362"> It is a challenge but we are anxious to provide a level of service that will deal with all of applications in a timely manner. My advice must be for citizens to check their passport and apply in time.</p>

            <p eId="para_363">I thank the Minister for his response, and also for the fact that this is under continual review. As I have said, all of us will be aware of the stresses that this generates for families when they find their passports may not be processed in time or are out of date. The first thing people should do, before any holidays or travel is booked, is to check their passport.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> The figures the Minister has given me in relation to the increases in applications in such a short time, from the North of Ireland of 50% and from Britain of 55%, are stark. Has the Department, in conjunction with the diplomatic service in Britain, looked at projecting that forward into next year? If anything, when we get into the Brexit negotiations further, when those in Britain realise that they are leaving the European Union and the value an Irish passport will hold with regard to freedom of travel across the rest of the European Union and residence, we should prepare for the worst. The applications of those who need passports to travel are being caught up in the system with those of others who are simply and understandably concerned about their travel rights within Europe at any time in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_365">We are in the course of a comprehensive reform programme in the Passport Office which will involve upgrading and modernising all system across the Passport Service up to 2019. This includes newer technology, new business processes, extra staff, improved service. We also moved office. This is medium-to-long-term planning in the Passport Office. We have also taken steps to improve communications with citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> Of course, the online application will considerably improve the situation. Already, the online service has processed over 30,000 applications. Public feedback has been positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_367"> I recognise the challenge here. I understand the frustration on the part of many citizens but I acknowledge that we are providing an important service, albeit under challenging circumstances. I urge Deputies to encourage use of the online system as the default option for anybody renewing his or her passport. The greater the uptake, the more resources that can be devoted to the more complex cases, such as first-time applicants, including first-time children applications, which take a bit of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_368"> My advice, at the end of this question as at the commencement of the question, is to allow sufficient time, advise applicants to apply online and check their passport, particularly now as we are entering the holiday season.</p>

            <p eId="para_371">I am aware of the comments to which the Deputy refers, and I am concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_372"> Dealing with long-outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland is of the utmost importance to me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Government. A Programme for a Partnership Government makes specific reference to the Government's commitment to the establishment of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, placing the needs of victims and survivors at the core of these institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_373"> In pursuit of this, I participated for the Government in recent months in the currently paused talks process in Belfast, where a critical element is to achieve a way forward on the setting up of the Stormont House legacy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> In the discussions on legacy issues, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation. I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_375"> The talks in Belfast will resume after the UK general election.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> In light of the speculation around the issue raised by the Deputy, it is worth stating clearly that there are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent agreement, including the Stormont House Agreement. The Government would not look favourably on any proposal to introduce such a measure, for State or non-State actors.</p>
            <p eId="para_377">The Government’s position is that the rule of law, including the requirement under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights for effective investigations of unlawful killings, must be upheld by all responsible authorities. In this regard, comments which effectively propose a selective approach to upholding the rule of law are not helpful. I have made clear that the legacy process is not about seeking to find an artificial balance or equivalence in investigations but about ensuring we have a comprehensive approach. That means looking at all Troubles related deaths, regardless of the affiliation of the perpetrators.</p>

            <p eId="para_378">There has been a clear abuse of parliamentary privilege. Those who remain without a voice, namely, the families of the victims, have an expectation that those elected to any parliament will respect the rule of law. In response to concerns raised by the Pat Finucane Centre on behalf of the families, the Speaker's office confirmed that the House of Commons had a long-standing resolution that references should not be made in debates to cases which were active in the courts. Does the Minister share my deep concerns about the underhand and devious attempts to undermine the rule of law and the independence of the prosecution service using the cover of parliamentary privilege? The concern is that this will prejudice the trial process. Does the Minister believe this is a crude attempt to try to collapse the trial process? I am sure he is aware that this is the first of many similar cases. The two cases involved go back 43 and 45 years, respectively. Those involved have been waiting a long time for justice and should not have to deal with comments made in the House of Commons and the British tabloid media.</p>

            <p eId="para_379">I am very concerned by the issue raised by the Deputy, but I repeat that the Government is fully committed to the architecture set out in the Stormont House agreement which provides the best framework for dealing comprehensively with the legacy of the past. There is no provision in the Good Friday Agreement for an amnesty from prosecution and the Government would not look favourably on any proposal to introduce such a measure. The rule of law, including the requirement for effective investigations of unlawful killings, must be upheld by all responsible authorities. In this regard, it is important that, as soon as practicable after the UK general election, all parties in Northern Ireland, including Deputy Crowe's party, sit around the table and ensure we will have a functioning Executive and that the institutions will be up and running in Northern Ireland, as per the wishes of the people expressed as far back as 2 March. It is regrettable that the parties have not reached agreement. I assure all parties involved that my Government colleagues and I will ensure we will take our responsibilities, obligations and duties very seriously under the Good Friday Agreement, of which we are co-guarantors and subsequent agreements. I look forward to a resumption of the talks, in a positive frame of mind, at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_380">I share the Minister's concerns about the Northern Ireland Executive which I also hope to see up and running and doing its work soon. My concern about this case is that it is a backdoor to providing immunity for British soldiers. We know that throughout the history of the conflict only four British soldiers were convicted of shooting civilians while on duty and that all four were freed within five years of beginning their life sentences through the use of the royal prerogative. The families are concerned that this is an attempt to try to collapse the cases in an underhand and devious way. They are also concerned because these are the first cases of many in a queue. I ask the Minister to relay his concerns on this matter to his British counterpart and write to the new Speaker of the House of Commons about same following the general election.</p>

            <p eId="para_381">Let me make it clear that I have already raised this issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire. I will also raise it with important elected representatives as soon as the talks get under way again.</p>
            <p eId="para_382"> I acknowledge the many men and women on both sides of the Border who performed their official duty to protect the public with honour, dedication and diligence throughout the Troubles. Their service has not been and must not be forgotten. There is no contradiction between this acknowledgement and the need for a clear-eyed holistic approach whereby wrongdoing and those responsible for such wrongdoing will be identified and pursued in accordance with the rule of law. That is the approach reflected in the Stormont House agreement and the one I will pursue.</p>

            <p eId="para_384">Everyone will agree that Ireland's corporation tax rate and our capacity to determine it are key components of our economic strategy. We must do all we can to protect it. Our corporation tax rate should not and cannot be used as a stick with which to beat us in the negotiations ahead. I ask the Minister whether, as part of the preliminary negotiations or discussions he has had with our European partners, Ireland's neutral status or corporation tax rate was discussed.

            <p eId="para_385">Over the course of the past 11 months, since the referendum in the United Kingdom I, with my Government colleagues, have been involved in an extensive programme of engagements with our EU partners on Brexit. There have been over 400 such engagements with the 27 EU member states and institutions which included, most recently, the visit of the European Union’s chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, to Ireland. The programme of engagements has been led by the Taoiseach, as well as my colleagues across government, complemented by official level meetings. For my part, I have had nearly 100 engagements with my EU counterparts and the EU institutions. A central goal of the engagement has been to ensure Ireland’s unique circumstances in the context of Brexit are understood by our EU partners and to seek explicit recognition of these issues and priorities in the European Union’s position for the withdrawal negotiations. Throughout my engagement with partners I have emphasised the political imperative of achieving flexible and imaginative solutions in the context of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, in particular, with a view to avoiding a hard border. In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland’s place in it. </p>
            <p eId="para_386"> The EU guidelines adopted by the Taoiseach and his counterparts on 29 April fully take account of the Government’s priority of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid a hard border, as well as recognising bilateral agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including the common travel area.</p>
            <p eId="para_387"> Neither Ireland’s status of neutrality nor our corporation tax rate has been raised in any of my engagements with EU partners, or those of my officials, in the context of the European Union’s negotiation guidelines and directives. These are matters which have no bearing on the forthcoming negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom. I have been struck by the very genuine level of engagement and understanding demonstrated by our EU partners of the significant political challenges Brexit poses for Ireland and, in particular, the peace process. Finding solutions will be a challenging exercise but my engagement with EU partners has left me fully confident that we can count on their support as we seek the right outcome for Ireland at the end of what will be a complex set of negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_388">I thank the Minister for his very clear response. I am sure he will agree that our need to be able to determine our own tax rate is greater than ever, given that we will probably be most affected by Brexit. It will potentially have a disproportionate effect on Ireland in comparison to other EU member states. I tabled my question in the context of remarks made by the new French President, Mr. Emmanuel Macron. I congratulate him on his election, but during the election campaign he singled out Ireland's corporation tax rate and said he believed the gaps in taxation between member states needed to be closed. There have been other similar signals, although perhaps they were only given in the context of an election campaign. Does the Minister agree that our neutrality, our right to set our own rates of corporation or other taxes and the common travel area are red line issues for Ireland in the Brexit negotiations?</p>

            <p eId="para_389">I am satisfied that Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality is sufficiently safeguarded by the existing constitutional provisions, such mechanisms as the protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, the various Defence Acts and our long-term policy documents. Tax rates remain within the exclusive competence of member states. All member states are free to set their own corporation tax rate, as they see fit. Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate has been a long-standing element of Government policy and remains the centrepiece of our competitive tax offering.</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> As I have said, the issue of Ireland's corporation tax rate has not been raised with me or any of my officials during our engagements with our EU partners on Brexit. I have to acknowledge that during these engagements, our position has received a very positive reception from our EU colleagues. There has been speculation about the UK's post-Brexit corporation tax plans. It should be noted that the UK's intention to reduce its current 20% corporation tax rate to 17% by 2020 was announced well in advance of the Brexit vote. I do not believe Brexit will have any impact on the UK's ability to set its own corporation tax rates, no more than it will have any impact - adverse or otherwise - on our ability to set our own corporation tax rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_391">I am glad, if somewhat surprised, to hear that this issue has not been mentioned. I wonder whether we have made it clear that we do not intend to move on these issues. We are firmly on the EU side of the table in these negotiations. The Minister has rightly mentioned that Britain intends to reduce its corporation tax rate to 17% by 2020. It is not just our corporation tax that makes this country attractive for inward investment. The most important factor is our educated workforce. We have a track record and a reputation as a place where companies can do business and employ people. I ask the Minister to keep it to the forefront of his mind that we cannot be complacent in this regard. We do not know what his new boss will do. I wish him well in that regard. It is very important that Ireland does not take its eye off the ball in case some of our more jealous European partners see this as an opportunity to squeeze what they might see as some concessions from us in areas like neutrality, corporation tax and the common travel area.</p>

            <p eId="para_392">I assure the Deputy and the House that there is no question of any form of complacency on the part of the Government in respect of this issue. We have made a reasonably positive start to these negotiations. Our priorities have been included in the negotiating guidelines and in the commencement position of the British Government, as outlined in its White Paper and in the letters sent to the EU from Prime Minister May. Ireland's long-standing policy of neutrality, which has been pursued by successive Governments, including one supported by Deputy O'Brien, is well known throughout the EU and Europe. I do not believe there is any EU member state that is not fully <i>au fait</i> with our long-standing policy of military neutrality, which goes hand in hand with our belief that international engagement is critical to enhanced co-operation and reduced conflict throughout the world. I am conscious of both issues raised by Deputy O'Brien. I assure him and the House that we will continue to be mindful of our unique position regarding our rate of corporation tax and our long-standing policy of military neutrality.</p>

            <p eId="para_394">Since I originally tabled this question, which seeks the Minister's views on the hunger strike among 1,500 Palestinian prisoners and calls on him to raise the matter with the Israeli authorities and to make a statement on the matter, the hunger strike has finished - this happened three days ago - on foot of a concession that will allow prisoners to get two visits every month. Talks are now taking place between the prison authorities and the prisoners. This is a victory, in a way, for the hunger strikers.</p>

            <p eId="para_395">Thankfully, the hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners has ended following an agreement at the weekend. It is understood that a new arrangement for a second family visit per month, and possibly other understandings, was the basis for ending the strike. The hunger strike by over 1,000 prisoners was a matter of great concern as it was entering its seventh week. I am relieved that it has ended without tragedy. We spoke directly about the need to avoid a tragic outcome with the Israeli ambassador and in other contacts with the Israeli authorities. The EU missions in Palestine, including Ireland’s mission in Ramallah, issued a public statement concerning the hunger strikes calling on Israel to respect fully the rights of prisoners. A further EU statement at higher level was being prepared when the strike ended.</p>
            <p eId="para_396"> I have said on the record that I do not believe there is any positive use of hunger strikes. When we expressed the concern of the Irish Government, we had to be conscious that many prisoners, including some of those who were on hunger strike, have been convicted of serious and violent offences. In addition, we were conscious that we could express similar or stronger concerns about prisoners in many other jurisdictions in the region, including Israel. We raised this matter in a low-key way for two reasons. First, we cannot support or encourage the use of hunger strikes as a means of exerting pressure. I have rejected its use on numerous occasions internationally and I will continue to do so. Second, we are aware from our own history of the real risk of attitudes hardening on either side, leading to tragedy, and of the danger of hunger strikes leading to increased tensions and clashes on the streets. We did not want to say anything that could add to that risk. I will not comment on the specific issues raised by the strikers. We have little detail on what has been agreed. I reiterate that my essential position and that of the Irish Government is that detained Palestinians should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords to its own citizens when they are under detention. Under international law, Palestinian prisoners should be held within their own territory. In that context, I emphasise that when Palestinians are being held in Israel, special attention must be given to ensuring family visits are realistically facilitated.</p>

            <p eId="para_397">Nobody would ever advocate that anyone should ever go on hunger strike. I think the 1,500 prisoners in this case were driven to desperation. Most of those who are in jail in Palestine are not even tried. They are held after raids in the occupied West Bank as part of what is known as "administrative detention". It is akin to the system of internment without trial that was in existence in the North some years ago. At the end of April, the number of Palestinian prisoners stood at 6,100, some 300 of whom were children. As the Minister has said, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners is much worse than the treatment of Israeli prisoners, even though many of them have not been convicted of anything. For example, Palestinian prisoners have no access to phones, study or work. The main demand of the hunger strikers was to be able to access phones to call their families. Israel responded brutally, for example by transferring prisoners, placing prisoners in solitary confinement, blocking visits from lawyers and confiscating property. It began a media offensive against a particular leading prisoner. We have our own experience of hunger strikes in this country. I think everyone should condemn the Israeli response in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">I acknowledge that some of the demands of the prisoners were made to seek forms of treatment that are broadly in line with international law. It should always be the case that prisoners receive such treatment. Some of the other demands, such as those relating to prison conditions, seemed reasonable. I do not really know all the circumstances so I am not going to comment in any great detail. Prison conditions in the Middle East generally are not the same as in Ireland or in Europe. For these reasons, I do not wish to comment specifically on the demands which were made. I stress the obvious principle that all Palestinian and Israeli prisoners should enjoy the same conditions and protections that Israel deems appropriate for its own citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_399">Next month's 50th anniversary of the occupation of the Golan Heights, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Sinai Peninsula will be a massive political issue. We should be calling for an end to arbitrary arrests by the Israeli authorities. In most cases, it is utterly illegal for people to be held without trial. Military raids on homes, dozens of which take place routinely, need to be brought to an end. I commend the Israeli Medical Association - the doctors' trade union - for refusing to take part in the force-feeding of hunger strikers. This made it difficult for the Israeli Government to implement force-feeding as a threat. I support utterly the demands of prisoners for access to education, communication and family visits. We need to end the occupation and the military courts that are in place in the Occupied Territories. All political prisoners should be released. The Government's position should be to support those basic demands loudly and clearly.</p>

            <p eId="para_400">I know that the Knesset passed a law two years ago authorising force feeding. My understanding is that this law has not been used to date. I am also aware that the Israeli doctors' organisation has stated that its members will not participate in force feeding. Fears that have been expressed about the use of force feeding have thus far not been borne out, but I want to avail of the opportunity here, in response to Deputy Coppinger, to say that I would consider the use of force feeding in the circumstances to be unacceptable.</p>

Telling me that a letter of request and a reply is the same as a robust procedure is simply not acceptable. We, as a neutral country, are now complicit in wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and so on. The death rate is appalling. If we look at Yemen alone, where a military raid was ordered by President Trump over dinner, 23 civilians were killed in that raid, including ten children aged 12 and under, an 80 year old man and several women. That was called a win by President Trump, although his senior officials have since confirmed that it was a mistake and that it was wrong. In Yemen, 19 million of the total 28 million population are in need of humanitarian aid, and one child under five dies every ten minutes from preventable diseases. We are complicit in that war and in this slaughter. I again put that simple question to the Minister. If his answer is that we are relying on assurances, I will take that but I ask him please to spell it out for me.</p>

            <p eId="para_407">I reject what the Deputy has said about our military neutrality. The practical implementation of the conditions for granting permission for landings is guided by and reflects Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, to which the Government remains fully committed. The statement of foreign policy entitled "A Global Island" approved by the Government in January 2015 clearly states that our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy. This policy goes hand in hand with our belief that international engagement is critical to enhance co-operation and to reduce conflict in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_408"> I assure the House and the Deputy that prior permission is required for all foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports and permission, if granted, is subject to strict conditions. In accordance, with international practice, foreign military aircraft which are granted permission to land in Ireland are not subject to inspection. Sovereign immunity, a long-standing principle of customary international law, means that a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in respect of another state and its property, including state or military aircraft. This principle applies automatically to foreign state or military aircraft in the same way as it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad. This is not a specific issue in regard to the United States; this is in regard to all foreign military aircraft landing at Irish airports.</p>

            <p eId="para_409">It is specifically in regard to America because international law has gone out the window with the election of President Trump. Prior to that, there were also the most serious breaches under the previous regime. The Minister is telling me that he is relying on reassurances. The lack of evidence has been raised in various court cases and those brave people who protest on a regular basis have been told to go and collect evidence. The word "protest" is wrong; rather they highlight and raise awareness about what is happening down in Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> More than 3 million American troops have gone through Shannon based on reassurances from them that they are carrying no arms. They are going through Shannon to refuel in order to wage war in countries that are innumerable at this point and the loss of life is appalling. We have a duty to live up to our neutrality and the Minister is simply not doing that and neither is the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_411">I do not accept that. In considering requests for landings by foreign military aircraft, my Department's focus is on ensuring that the information provided with regard to flights and aircraft demonstrates that they comply with the conditions as applicable. Matters such as the times at which landings take place are operational ones for the pilot or pilots in consultation with the airport in question. They do not affect the decision on whether the aircraft meets the strictest conditions which the Department has laid down. Officials in my Department are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to process any requests received and to maintain ongoing contact with embassies, particularly from those from which, by reason of geography, we receive the most applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> I wish to assure the House again that Ireland's traditional and longstanding policy of military neutrality, which I am pleased is the stated policy of all parties in the House, is in no way adversely affected or threatened. The practical implementation of the conditions reflects Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. The Government firmly remains committed to that policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_418">Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there has been enormous progress on this island which has been particularly beneficial for Border communities. The people whom I have the privilege of representing in two of the southern Ulster counties will not countenance a return to the imposition of the restrictions we had in the past on the movement of people, goods or services. Has the Minister had any contact or discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland since the commencement of the British general election campaign? The Secretary of State is in the very fine position in political life of having a safe majority of 16,000 so he is not under considerable pressure during an election campaign. I hope that he has been giving some time to the urgent need to have the Northern Ireland institutions restored and also to have ongoing contact and work done in the context of Brexit and particularly as it will affect our island.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_419">I have spoken directly with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, since the campaign in the UK commenced some weeks ago. I assure the Deputy and the House that the avoidance of a hard Border on the island of Ireland and the maintenance of the common travel area are at the core of the Government’s priorities in the EU-UK negotiations. As a symbol of and a dividend from the peace process, an open Border is essential to the social and economic fabric on the island and to the continuing normalisation of relationships that has been facilitated by the Good Friday Agreement. The Government is clear that the withdrawal agreement should create no impediment to the free movement of people on the island and should create no circumstance where the normalisation of peoples' lives that has accompanied the peace process is undermined.</p>
            <p eId="para_420"> The avoidance of a hard Border on the island of Ireland is a shared objective of the Irish and British Governments and our EU partners. This has been confirmed by Secretary of State Brokenshire and British Prime Minister May on her visit to Dublin earlier this year. It has also been confirmed by the European Council. The EU negotiation guidelines contain a very strong acknowledgement of Ireland’s unique circumstances, including the need to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland. The negotiating directives for the task force, adopted by the General Affairs Council on 22 May, fully reflect this acknowledgement. The European Parliament has also recognised the need to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland in a resolution supported by virtually all the main European political groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> The UK Government notification letter, which formally triggered Article 50, placed a strong emphasis on the "unique relationship" between these two islands. The letter confirmed that the UK Government wishes to avoid a return to a hard Border, to maintain the common travel area and to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> As laid out in the negotiating guidelines, the avoidance of a hard Border will require flexibility and creativity on the part of both the United Kingdom and the European Union. Ireland has made clear its expectation that there will need to be a political solution and not just a legal or a technical solution, given this represents a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_423"> Achieving this objective will not be easy and compromises will be required by both the UK and the European Union, in order to find a solution that realises the shared objective of avoiding a hard Border, and one which protects Ireland’s obligations, interests and advantages as a continuing and committed member of the EU 27.</p>
            <p eId="para_424"> The maintenance of the common travel area following the UK withdrawal from the EU is a priority for both the Irish and UK Governments. The common travel area predates Irish and UK membership of the European Union and is not dependent on EU membership. The common travel area is particularly important in underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process and relations on the island of Ireland, and it has been acknowledged by our EU partners in the negotiation guidelines and directives.</p>
            <p eId="para_425"> As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during the discussions following the Assembly elections, I strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland's interests can be effectively represented as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations. Additionally, I have been in frequent contact with all my EU counterparts, including my British counterparts, approaching 80 engagements over the past ten months.</p>
            <p eId="para_426"> In the negotiations, which will commence after the British general election, the Government will pursue an outcome that protects our headline priorities and Ireland’s fundamental interests, including avoidance of a hard Border and the maintenance of the common travel area. We are not under any illusions about the challenge and complexity of these negotiations and have engaged in detailed and ongoing planning in order to prepare for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> As the Deputy represents a Border area, I assure the House that whether before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence or in the course of plenary session of the House, I at all times welcome the observations of Deputy Smith on issues concerning the Border area. I look forward to the House fully engaging once the negotiations commence.</p>

            <p eId="para_428">I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and I welcome his strong statements. I do not for one second doubt the Minister's absolute commitment and hard work in this area. I sincerely hope that work will continue into the future. The Minister basically outlined again what we discussed at our meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence last week and we will have another meeting during the course of next month specifically devoted to Brexit. That is very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_429"> Apart from that, there have been some unwelcome developments over the past few weeks from the Conservative Party in Britain. It has made several statements that, while not directly challenging the common travel area by name, undermine it by implication. I refer to a tweet from the Conservative Party that states "Brexit gives us an opportunity to get control of our borders but only if we get the negotiations right.". Broad and sweeping statements like this from the Tories are sending mixed signals, as many commentators see a clear and glaring conflict between the absolute commitment to "control our borders" while also supporting the common travel area, as EU citizens have the right to travel to Ireland. What is worrying is that the Secretary of State's party - the Tory Party - is more firmly committed to controlling the borders than positively maintaining the common travel area in its current operations. The Minister knows that with the common travel area we have heard references from British Government Ministers and others to keep it "as frictionless as possible" with "no return to borders of the past". Has the Secretary of State or the British Head of Government given to the Minister or the Taoiseach any indication of what is meant by those phrases?</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_430">Avoiding a hard Border on the island of Ireland, with the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in its entirety, remains an absolute priority for this Government. This is a position that has been well heard and is well understood right across the European Union. I am pleased to say it has been expressly reflected in the negotiating guidelines. As set out in the guidelines, imaginative and flexible solutions will be required. Our absolute priority and preference is to maintain the closest possible trading relationship, based on a level playing field, between the UK and the European Union, including Ireland. There is much negotiation yet to be done around trading arrangements, and by extension, any customs regime that might apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> It is premature to set out detailed possible solutions, in particular when the negotiations have yet to properly begin. However, it is important that technical solutions do not anticipate or drive outcomes at political level. I agree with Deputy Smith. There has been an extensive level of engagement with and by our EU partners to understand this issue. Ireland will continue to work with the task force and our EU partners to find solutions in line with our commitment to the integrity of the Single Market but the UK has its own responsibilities. It will need to show with its actions the commitment to the stated objective of protecting the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard Border.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">I thank the Minister. The Tory manifesto put before the electorate contains a rather vague commitment with respect to the Northern Ireland position. It states: "As we leave the European Union, we recognise Northern Ireland's unique circumstances and will seek to ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are protected." The phrase "will seek to" does not reassure any of us, and I am sure it does not reassure the Minister. The Minister may not have had the opportunity to ask the Secretary of State what his party and Government mean by that phrase. I suggest to the Minister that with the negotiations taking place with the new British Government, the Irish people would want to know as soon as possible what is meant by "as frictionless" a Border as possible and the meaning of "no return to the borders of the past". Will the Minister ensure that at an early stage in the negotiations with the new British Government, he will be able to give the people I represent and all those on this island a commitment that there will be no return or impediments in any way for people travelling North or South or anywhere within the island following Brexit? We need a clear message for the people of this island that there will be no countenance of a return to the impositions on travel, whether affecting people, goods or services.</p>

            <p eId="para_433">I agree with the Deputy on the need to ensure we can maintain the open Border and the bilateral arrangement of many years standing, the common travel area, in the context of the negotiations. In this regard, let me repeat that Ireland, in conjunction with and as a member of the EU 27, is pleased so far that our EU colleagues have recognised fully the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">However, as I said earlier, the UK also has its responsibilities and will need to come to the table with an open mind and show by its actions its commitment to its stated objective of protecting the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and the maintenance of an open Border. It is premature to begin setting out in detail possible solutions. I expect the negotiations will commence shortly after the conclusion of the British general election on 8 June. Ireland will work with the task force and our EU partners to find solutions in line with our commitment to the integrity of the Single Market, our priorities being the maintenance of the open Border and the full protection of the common travel area in line with our commitments, obligations and duties under the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">I very much welcome the Minister's statement that the British Government will have to show its commitment early on. That is the message we need to get out to the electorate here, that our Government and its European counterparts will ensure we will not have meaningless phrases from the Head of the British Government or other members of that Government or at official level. This is the last Question Time we will have before the British general election and the resumption of talks on the need to have the Northern Ireland institutions restored. There is a huge urgency, as we all know, in ensuring that the Northern Ireland institutions are restored. They are critical to ensure we have the outcome to the Brexit negotiations that we all want and to try to limit the damage as much as possible to all of this island. I appeal to the Minister again to ensure that at Government level, after the formation of the new British Government, he repeats again the need for the British Government to show its commitment early on and to show clarity regarding what it would see as the arrangements that will exist between this island and Britain post-2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_436">The Deputy raises two issues. First, regarding the Northern Ireland Executive, on behalf of the Irish Government, I look forward to being in Stormont on or around Monday, 12 June, in order to ensure there will be an appropriate level of momentum in the talks. There has not been a functioning executive in Northern Ireland this year. I believe it is long overdue and I believe there is a role and function particularly for the parties that have been elected to the Assembly to ensure we have a full work-out of the institutions. I believe that with the appropriate level of political will, that can happen before the statutory deadline of 29 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> Regarding the second point, I reassure Deputy Smith that the Government has made clear our commitment to minimise the impact of Brexit on the Border region in particular. I do not accept what the British Prime Minister repeated again last night, that no deal is better than a bad deal. I believe it is fundamental to the process that both the European Union, of which Ireland will continue to be a member, and the UK negotiating team come to the table in a spirit of goodwill in order to do a deal. We are committed to ensuring that there will be no impediment to movement on the island of Ireland and that the withdrawal agreement will in no way create circumstances which will undermine the peace process and the normalisation it has brought to people's lives, as the Deputies, particularly those from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, will be aware.</p>

            <p eId="para_441">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 67 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> I thank the Deputy for her question. I reiterate the points I made in response to the previous question asked by Deputy Smith. My expectation is that these negotiations will commence in June. It is absolutely essential that both parties - the EU, including Ireland, and the UK - address these negotiations in a spirit of compromise but also of goodwill and constructive engagement. The negotiating guidelines make reference to Gibraltar within the context of the framework of the future EU-UK relationship, which is the subject of a separate negotiation. This is entirely distinct and separate from the Irish Government's priority, which is to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement, are recognised. The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty registered with the United Nations, and this is a key distinguishing factor of our unique position in Ireland. It is important to note that any future trade deal between the European Union and the UK is likely to have to be ratified by national parliaments as well as the EU institutions. This is where the European Parliament has a role to play along with the leading role of the EU Council, comprising the heads of state or government of the member states. It is important to note that these negotiations will not be concluded in their entirety until such time as there is a trade deal between the European Union and the UK. Any trade deal will, in all likelihood, have to be ratified by national parliaments, including Ireland's.</p>

            <p eId="para_444">My understanding is that the negotiations will be concluded. At this stage it is too early to speculate on any detail of the negotiations, but I encourage the European Union, including Ireland, to approach these negotiations with a view towards concluding a deal. Our wish and priority is that there will be as close as possible a relationship, ultimately, between the departing UK as a former member of the European Union and the remaining EU 27. This is why I do not agree with or subscribe to the view that no deal is better than a bad deal. I believe it is important that everyone approach these negotiations with a view towards reaching a deal in what will be a very difficult and challenging environment. No EU member has ever left the Union, which is why detailed negotiations over a period of two years or more need to be approached in as constructive a way as possible in order ultimately to give rise to an agreement on the part of EU heads of state and government which will be ratified by the European Parliament.</p>

            <p eId="para_445">In the event that the final deal has elements which are unfavourable to, unacceptable to or difficult for Ireland, is the Minister suggesting Ireland will have a veto on the deal? It is a factual question about the rules regarding the final, final negotiation when the UK chooses to leave. This is important in the context of recent statements - as recently as last night - by the British Prime Minister that no deal and a simple exit would be better than a bad Brexit. This has profound implications. In a certain sense, I do not think we wish to see this happen. We do not wish to see Britain leave the EU at all, but Britain seems set on its particular course, and last night the Prime Minister reiterated again, admittedly in the context of a general election, that no deal is better than a bad deal. Therefore, when it comes to the final, final stage, which we have been told many times by the Taoiseach will be for the heads of state after all the different institutions and so on have had their say and their participation, will the decision be made by qualified majority voting, as has been suggested, or will Ireland as a country have a veto?</p>

Any form of side negotiations between Ireland and the UK or any bilateral arrangements would, given the circumstances, be unhelpful. We are firmly on the side of the solidarity and support we have received from our EU partners.

            <p eId="para_451">Ireland has taken careful note of the decision of the Court of Justice of 21 December 2016, in which it set aside the decision of the General Court to annul the EU-Morocco agricultural deal. The judgment upheld the validity of the EU association agreement with Morocco, but stipulated that it does not apply to the territory of Western Sahara.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> Ireland has a long-standing position in support of the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> As a matter of practicality, almost all goods from Western Sahara are likely to be exported to, or via, Morocco. It would not be in the interests of the farmers, fishermen and other producers of Western Sahara wishing to sell their goods abroad if they were to be prevented from doing so due to the territory’s disputed status. However, the court has made clear that in order for the association agreement and related protocols to apply to Western Sahara, the consent of the people of Western Sahara will first be required. </p>
            <p eId="para_454"> The<b>
							</b>possible renegotiation of the association agreement, or modification of its protocols to provide for treatment of goods coming from Western Sahara, is currently under discussion at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_457">The Minister might remember that when the agreement was going through the House I raised concerns in respect of this matter at the time. People said it was not a concern at all and so on. Clearly, the European Court of Justice has difficulties with the agreement. It involves the issue of consent. My concern is that unless we talk to those who represent the people of Western Sahara we will be going down the same road. My concern is that the Commission is trying to rebrand the same agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_458"> Can the Minister confirm that the Government will block any attempts by the European Commission to negotiate exclusively with Morocco and ignore the only legitimate and UN recognised representatives of the people of Western Sahara, namely, the Polisario Front? It seems obvious to me that the EU and the European Commission must speak to the Polisario Front urgently in order to find a viable solution and address the status of European companies and goods exported from Western Sahara. What different approach will Ireland be taking following the European Court of Justice judgment?</p>

            <p eId="para_459">Ireland considers Western Sahara to be a non-self-governing territory. Ireland, as I have said, supports the right of self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We do not have a view on the outcome of the court's decision, be it independence, integration, autonomy or some other legal or constitutional framework, as long as it is decided in what must be a genuine exercise in self-determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> We have taken careful note of the court's decision of last December which upheld the validity of the EU's association agreement with Morocco. It stipulated that it does not apply to the territory of Western Sahara. Ireland, as the Deputy will be aware, has a long-standing position in support of the right of self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p>
            <p eId="para_461"> These are complex issues and a resolution will take some time. For example, the agreement on agricultural products was negotiated and agreed in the agriculture working group at the Agriculture Council. That was within the framework of the EU-Morocco association agreement that entered into force some 17 years ago. It was ratified by all EU member states, including Ireland. I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to express an interest in this area and, ultimately, the issue will be a matter for the people of Western Sahara.</p>

            <p eId="para_463"> There are two cases pending before the European Court of Justice regarding the EU-Morocco fisheries partnership agreement. The agreement secures EU fishing rights in Moroccan and Western Saharan waters in exchange for Morocco receiving €40 million annually, nearly half of which was supposed to be spent on developing the fishing industry in Morocco.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> The EU approved funding of specific projects, including projects in Western Sahara. This means that Brussels is directly assisting the Moroccan Government in developing its infrastructure in a territory that, according to the European Court of Justice, lies outside of Morocco's internationally recognised borders.

One of the key moves we could make is to get our European Union colleagues to start monitoring his case and show a real interest in it. We made that case to the European delegation when we were in Cairo. We were led to understand that one or two countries, in particular Greece, were against such a move.

            <p eId="para_469">This matter was raised on the Order of Business today. I wish to assure Deputy Ryan that this remains a priority consular case in my Department. We are now running at just under 3,000 consular cases per annum. I can say without a shadow of doubt or fear of contradiction that this is the case that is receiving the most priority in terms of resources and interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> I am very concerned about the ongoing situation. Since the last adjournment of the case, I have had the opportunity to raise the issue directly with a number of my EU colleagues in Brussels, in particular the High Representative and Foreign Affairs Council Chair, Federica Mogherini. I have raised this issue consistently with her over the past number of years and I know she has raised the issue directly with the Egyptian Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">I also raised the issue as recently as last Monday week with a number of EU Foreign Ministers, in particular my colleague, Mr. Jean Asselborn, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg and dean, or senior member, of the Foreign Affairs Council. I have also had the opportunity on a number of recent occasions to raise the issue with senior Members of the European Parliament which has adopted a resolution on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> I am very concerned at the delay in bringing this trial to a conclusion. I acknowledge, however, that there was an element of progress at the last two hearings. Witnesses are being called, evidence is being heard and the case is proceeding. I regret that the next return date is not until July but I note that courts do not sit in Egypt during the Ramadan period.

            <p eId="para_473">I am afraid the Minister's activity is not working. Something needs to change. While the Minister says there has at least been some progress, there is no sign of this court case coming to an end. It is a mass trial of 480 people, including one European citizen from this State. Why is the European Commission delegation in Cairo not monitoring the case given that this is a European citizen? What has the Minister done specifically to change that so European Union monitoring takes place and the Egyptian Government knows that it is not just the Irish Government but the whole European Union which finds this situation intolerable? What has the Minister done to get EU monitoring of the case and why has it not happened? Our parliamentary delegation to Cairo could not have made it more plain to the European Commission that we wanted that monitoring to happen. It was one of the most heightened exchanges of our visit but nothing has happened since. What is the Minister going to do to effect that one lever over which we at least have some control rather than to say there is some progress and that some witnesses have been heard? Why is the European Union not in that court to see what is going on and to represent the European and Irish citizen in the case?</p>

            <p eId="para_474">It is regrettable that Deputy Ryan does not acknowledge the fact that there has been an element of momentum in recent times in this case. The trial is proceeding. I regret, however, that it has not yet concluded. I assure the Deputy that the European Union has been a strong ally of Ireland on this matter. I refer to my representations to Federica Mogherini and her role, in particular, as well as that of her colleagues in the Commission who have advocated strongly and consistently on our behalf with the Egyptian Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> We have been pursuing the question of EU trial monitoring at local level in Cairo. This requires consensus among all member states represented in Egypt. I admit that such consensus does not exist currently but we are continuing to follow up actively on the matter. We have made representations to a number of EU member state governments and continue to work to achieve a consensus on the issue. As the Deputy will be aware and as I assure him again, this is the No. 1 priority consular case in my Department. We will continue to actively engage on the issue until such time as our Irish citizen is released and home with his family to resume his studies here in the city of Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">Does the Minister believe he will have a European Commission delegate at the next hearing to monitor the case? He has not answered the question. I may be wrong and I do not want to defame any particular country, but I understand that one of the obstacles to consensus is opposition from the Greek Government to such monitoring. Whatever about the Minister's meetings with Madame Mogherini and the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, what specific communication has he had with the Greek Government to overcome that key blockage to get EU monitoring of the case and increase the pressure on the Egyptian judicial system? Surely, we have the right to do that at this stage because our European citizen is stuck for the 24th time going to court without any case being heard or concluded in a mass trial of 480 people. What specifically has the Minister done with the Greek Government to overcome that block and does he believe there will be European monitoring of the case when it returns in July?</p>

            <p eId="para_477">It is my hope that we will be in a position to have EU monitoring. I assure the Deputy in the meantime, however, the Irish Government and our representative in Cairo continue to be actively engaged and to attend at each and every one of the hearings to date. While we await the conclusion of the trial, I assure the House that every effort is being made to secure the health and welfare of our citizen while he remains on remand. The Government's strategy is under continuous review. We have engaged in continuous and constant consultation with the family of Ibrahim Halawa, the lawyers acting on his behalf here in Ireland and in Egypt, experts from civil society and NGOs which have shown an interest in the case. As I have said before, if any Member of the House believes he or she can be of any assistance, I am happy to speak to him or her.

            <p eId="para_481">The Government is strongly committed to responding to the unprecedented humanitarian needs in east Africa, in particular in the Horn of Africa. Conflict, drought, severe food insecurity and now famine are causing massive population displacements and suffering throughout the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> As a consequence, the humanitarian situation is continuing to deteriorate and 5 million people are classified as severely food insecure in South Sudan. Famine is affecting 100,000 people in parts of the country and a further 1 million people are now on the brink of famine. In Somalia, 3.2 million people are in crisis and the risk of famine remains extremely high. Over 10 million people in Ethiopia and Kenya are also now facing an acute hunger crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> As such, the continued provision of timely humanitarian assistance to avert a catastrophe in the region is essential. Through the Irish Aid programme, Ireland has provided €120 million in humanitarian assistance in the Horn region since 2012, including €29 million in 2016 and €17 million so far this year. Our assistance is supporting our UN and NGO partners in their responses with a focus on providing food assistance, treating malnutrition, providing shelter and protection for displaced people, and providing emergency services in water, sanitation and health care.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> Last month, we airlifted over 100 tonnes of emergency relief supplies to Somalia while earlier this month a further 34 tonnes were airlifted to South Sudan for distribution to displaced families.

            <p eId="para_486">With the humanitarian crisis, there is breakdown in civil society and some of the official and unofficial bodies in the region are acting against the humanitarian agencies.

            <p eId="para_487">This is an area of severe and consistent challenge, where there is severe drought following poor rainfall over the past two years. This is coupled with conflict and violence, as the Deputy has said, with particular reference to Al-Shabaab's insurgency. Inter-clan fighting has led to a very worrying deteriorating situation in Somalia and other countries in the region. Ireland's response is, in the main, by way of humanitarian assistance. This is delivered on the ground by our partners, in particular the UN Refugee Agency and the World Food Programme. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the programme's headquarters in Rome, where I saw the great work done by everybody there, in particular scores of young Irish participants. I acknowledge the work of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the UN Children's Fund, the International Red Cross, the International Red Crescent and non-governmental organisations, in particular, Concern, Trócaire, Oxfam Ireland, World Vision Ireland, Plan Ireland and Christian Aid. These NGOs have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable of communities. Our partners, in particular, the International Committee of the Red Cross, are best placed to provide assistance in conflict situations and gain access to areas where other organisations are unable to operate, such as Syria, Iraq and South Sudan. I share the Deputy's concern. This is a real and serious challenge.</p>

            <p eId="para_488">The Minister has outlined very comprehensively the humanitarian work being done, but there also needs to be diplomatic work and political intervention, perhaps in South Sudan where the civil war is ongoing and in northern Kenya, to ensure humanitarian workers do not become targets themselves and ensure they can deliver humanitarian aid because this is becoming a very real concern. It is unusual that they are becoming targets and this needs diplomatic intervention.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">I do not disagree with what the Deputy has said. In the course of my earlier responses, I dwelt, in particular, on the humanitarian aid and assistance to which Ireland has been to the fore in contributing. We are very concerned about the unprecedented level of humanitarian need globally and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in many parts of the world. In respect of assistance towards the resolution of conflict, the international community, including the European Union, continues to strongly support the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region. Those with influence on warring parties must bring it to bear on those involved in conflict and those in search of peace because without peace needs will continue to rise and millions more will suffer from acute hunger and famine. In addition to seeking political solutions, we must also urge respect for international humanitarian law so in the interim period humanitarian assistance can reach those in need. We must urgently scale up our humanitarian assistance to help those now on the brink of famine to avoid catastrophe, and encourage other donors to step up their assistance. I am proud of the response of Ireland in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_491">My question relates to the Palestinian prisoners being denied basic human rights and forced to go onto hunger strike. The question is also about Ireland's role in bringing these concerns to the relevant authorities through our diplomatic services in Tel Aviv and Ramallah, and the engagement at EU level on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_492">I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Question No. 49 and to the Topical Issues debate on 10 May, when I was able to address this matter in more detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_493"> I acknowledge the end of the hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners following an agreement reached at the weekend. It is understood a new arrangement for a second family visit per month, and possibly other understandings, were the basis for ending the strike.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> As the hunger strike by more than 1,000 prisoners was entering its seventh week it was a matter of great concern, and I am relieved that it has been ended without death or tragedy.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> We had spoken directly about the need to avoid a tragic outcome with the Israeli ambassador and in other contacts with the Israeli authorities. The EU missions in Palestine, including Ireland’s mission in Ramallah, issued a public statement concerning the hunger strikes, calling on Israel to respect fully the rights of prisoners. A further EU statement at higher level was being prepared when word came through of the ending of the hunger strike.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> In expressing our concerns, I want to make clear we had to be conscious that many prisoners, including some of those on hunger strike, had been convicted of very serious and most violent offences, and that we could express similar or stronger concerns about prisoners in many other jurisdictions in the region, as well as in Israel.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> We raised this matter in a rather low-key way for two reasons, namely, as I made quite clear earlier, we cannot support or encourage the use of hunger strikes as a means of exerting pressure and we are aware from our own history of the real risk of attitudes hardening on either side, leading to death and tragedy, and the danger of a hunger strike leading to increased tensions and clashes on the streets. We did not want to say anything that might increase the risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> I will not comment any further on specific issues raised by the strikers. I have little detail on what has been agreed. However, I will state Ireland's essential position was that detained Palestinians should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens when detained.</p>

            <p eId="para_499">I thank the Minister. I listened to his earlier reply. I also welcome the fact there has been resolution. The question has to be asked why do these men and women feel the need to go on hunger strike and take such a drastic decision, which could have had very serious repercussions on their health and lives if it had continued. When I saw what they achieved by going on hunger strike I asked myself whether that was all they were looking for. They were very basic rights, which other people would take for granted. Prisoners have human rights, and international human rights law guarantees them basic human rights, such as freedom from torture and freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. What they achieved was very simple, including landlines in prison, better health care, which one would assume would be taken for granted, and more regular family visits. There is a need to respect the rights of prisoners, regardless of where they are, and there are concerns about increasing use of solitary confinement.</p>

            <p eId="para_500">I acknowledge and agree with what Deputy O'Sullivan has said about the role of international law. Under international law, it is fair to say Palestinian prisoners should be held in their own territory. After 50 years of occupation, there is not much of an excuse for failing to have adequate detention facilities in the occupied territory. I understand holding prisoners in Israel creates difficulty for family visitors, given how difficult and onerous it is for Palestinians to cross into Israel. For as long as prisoners are held in Israel, appropriate and expeditious arrangements should be made to facilitate family visits under reasonable conditions. I understand this has been part of the agreement reached with the prisoners to facilitate their ending of the hunger strike. However, there are no circumstances in which I would condone the use of hunger strikes to exert pressure or increase demands.</p>

            <p eId="para_501">I raise this matter because numerous complaints have been made to me about how individuals, be they farmers, veterinarians or people generally in that sector, are treated by officials. I raised this matter previously in a Topical Issue Debate and I was told at the time that action would be taken. Since then, I must admit that some action was taken. I thank the Taoiseach for his particular interest in the case which I raised that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> However, the same individuals are now causing the same difficulties with businesses, by entering the business, practice or farm and treating the individuals as if they were criminals and as if a decision had already been made on their case. Actions such as people taking a particular medication from a vehicle, entering an office and taking papers, not explaining who they represent and essentially taking the law into their own hands and treating people very badly comprise the general complaint I am receiving. On the last occasion that I mentioned a case, it was dealt with. It is unusual that the case brought to my attention recently is one in which an individual, who at that time was asked to present himself as a witness and refused to do so on the basis that he had nothing to do with that case, is now being investigated by the Department and being treated like a criminal. Before the case is even heard he is now asked to answer a fitness to practise complaint from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> An individual in this State is innocent until proven guilty. Surely the Department must go through a process to find out the extent of the wrongdoing or non-compliance with a regulation before it goes anywhere else. That is the least one would expect, but that is not happening in this case. I believe it is not happening due to the fact that he refused not so much to co-operate but to support a story, which was untrue, of another veterinarian on another occasion. Protocols and regulations must be put in place to ensure that this does not happen and to ensure an innocent individual, who has not been convicted anywhere, is treated fairly. The leaks from the Department to the media about these cases must be stopped. They are putting jobs in the country at risk as well as the reputation of an individual or individuals who have never been convicted and have yet to go through the process. The Department is using the might of its legal arm and taxpayers' money to chase down those people, break them before they go into court and have their reputations and businesses ruined.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> There was a case in which Judge Reynolds made certain references to individuals. That type of case still occurs. I am aware of one such case. It is really offensive that the State would ruin a person's life and business without first going to the courts and finding out the facts. I also believe the might of the State's legal arm and taxpayers' money should not be used to force an individual into a position where they must accept something that they believe they are innocent of, because they cannot afford, on either a reputation or financial basis, to go through the courts. It is unacceptable.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Michael Creed)<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_505">I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this matter. Officials in my Department carry out a significant range of on-farm inspections annually for the various EU funded schemes and other sector-specific requirements. Inspections are also carried out on commercial producers, wholesale and retail outlets, meat plants, milk processing facilities and forestry nurseries. Veterinary related controls cover a wide range of regulatory activity including animal health, animal welfare, veterinary medicines, animal identification and registration, animal movement, fallen stock and animal by-products and public health.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> The EU regulation governing the various area-based direct payment schemes and rural development measures requires my Department to carry out on-the-spot inspections annually to ensure compliance with the eligibility criteria of the various schemes. Inspections are also required to ensure compliance with cross-compliance requirements, as set down in EU legislation, and the standards for good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC. These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. These EU funded schemes are worth approximately €1.5 billion annually to farmers. Inspecting officers undergo regular training on the procedures for inspections and carry out inspections in accordance with the EU regulations. Procedures and guidance documents issue to all officers. Inspections are subject to supervisory and performance checks to ensure accuracy and consistency.</p>
            <p eId="para_507"> There is a comprehensive review and appeal system in place for applicants if they consider that inspections are not conducted in accordance with legislative requirements or if they are unhappy with the inspection findings. This incorporates an internal review process and the option to appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent agriculture appeals office. In the event that an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome he or she may pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> As indicated, controls by veterinary personnel and other departmental officials cover a broad range of areas including animal health, animal welfare, veterinary medicines, animal identification and registration, animal movement, fallen stock, animal by-products and public health. Each of the inspections is carried out using standardised forms and reporting arrangements with a system of oversight by line managers, fulfilling requirements relating to EU or national legislation. Officials from the investigation division of my Department conduct a small number of investigations where serious non-compliance is suspected. At the end of the investigation, the evidence is assessed to determine if the matter is to be prosecuted. In such cases, a file is prepared and sent to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for assessment and, if appropriate, the commencement of the prosecution process.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> In addition to compliance with EU and national legislation requirements on inspections, the Charter of Farmers' Rights agreed between my Department and the various farming organisations sets out commitments relating to inspections. Compliance by Department officials with these commitments is reviewed regularly by the independently chaired farmers' charter monitoring committee. My Department has a customer complaints procedure which allows an individual to have his or her case examined. All complaints are investigated thoroughly. This procedure involves a three step process and if the complainant is still not satisfied with the response it is open to him or her to contact the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> I assure the House that the various inspection regimes operated by officials of my Department are implemented in accordance with EU and national legislation governing these requirements. The inspection regimes are subject to audit by various EU, national and certifying bodies to ensure compliance with the requirements. Furthermore, inspections and investigations are carried out in line with the principles of the farmers' charter, including that of treating everyone properly, fairly, impartially and with courtesy.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> Finally, officials in my Department, including all inspecting officers, are required to comply with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2011 and, where applicable, complete an annual statement of interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">All of that sounds fine but it is not what has happened in this case. Due procedure was not followed and the individual veterinarian is almost guilty before he is taken through the process. Surely the Minister can intervene to insist that justice be done and that the regulations and process be adhered to. I ask him to do that. I gave him the details of the case last week. I stress the fact that because of what happened historically this individual is now caught up in the antics of a veterinarian from the Department, which is carrying out an investigation that does not comply with any standards at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> Furthermore, what action can the Minister take against a veterinarian within the Department who is breaking the law by providing unlabelled bottles for intravenous medication and so forth? Who monitors that? What action will the Minister take on the case I outlined to him to prevent further damage to the business concerned and to ensure that everything is done in accordance with best practice? That includes the leaking of information to the media to blacken a person's name. There were two cases, the Fannin and Farrell cases, before the courts and they were dealt with but the Department never came back to the people to pay what it should have paid. It never addressed the Judge Reynolds judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">Now the same thing is happening again. Veterinarians within the Department are doing what they like to individuals, going into offices and taking paperwork. In the case in question, the secretary left. In the previous case, it was a pregnant woman in the office whom they offended. They would not comply with the requirements of the Garda either. Something has to be done to stop the individual concerned from doing what is going on in Kilkenny.</p>

            <p eId="para_517">I abhor media-inspired leaks about cases under investigation. I am not aware of the contact point for the stories in question. Leaks make cases that are difficult more difficult to adjudicate on in a fair and impartial manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> On the specific case to which the Deputy is alluding but not referencing, which I appreciate, he will appreciate the <i>sub judice</i> rule. He will also appreciate that I cannot comment on a specific instance because the case is listed before the courts. I assure him, however, that for officers of my Department involved in inspections across a range of activities, including veterinary and other inspectors, there is a code of practice which is framed within the context of EU and domestic legislation. The code which has been in place since 2004 is under review. I hope all those employed in my Department carry out their duties in accordance with it. I refer, in particular, to the obligation to be civil and courteous to those under investigation or subject to spot checks. In recent days the Deputy furnished me with the details of a specific case, about which I am inquiring further in my Department. It would not be appropriate at this stage, therefore, to comment further on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">I thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, for taking this Topical Issue in the light of yesterday's report which made for harrowing reading, to say the least. I commend Dr. Geoffrey Shannon for the audit he conducted and also An Garda Síochána for requesting it. The findings are absolutely shocking and horrifying, to say the very least. We are not talking about historical cases but about the current context. We are talking about cases dating from 2014 and 2015 which are now before us. In 2012 we voted to enshrine the rights of children into the Constitution, but what good is that if we are leaving some of the most vulnerable children exposed to horrific abuse? Clearly, we need strong inter-agency co-operation to ensure the rights of the child are upheld. We discovered yesterday that inter-agency co-operation was not taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_520"> We are talking about a 24-hour service which we have in four counties in the entire country. The rest of the country does not have an out-of-hours service. The ISPCC has been discussing the issue and was bringing it to the attention of previous Governments for the past ten years. It is absolutely shocking. What is the Minister going to do to address the issue of having a 24-hour, out-of-hours social care service which social care workers have been looking for? We need to know that the Minister has confidence in Tusla and that she and her Department will support its expansion. I also want her to address the issue of recruitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_521">It is fair to say the revelations in the report on yesterday evening's programme were deeply upsetting and quite shocking. Some of the examples given and cases highlighted indicated that children were on the floor with excrement on their clothes and in dirt. Some violence may have been inflicted on children in public places. The case that stood out the most for me was that of the child identified as Mark. It is quite chilling to think he may still be in circumstances of abuse and neglect. It was quite shocking.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> There are two issues that I believe need to be followed up. The first was touched on by Deputy Anne Rabbitte, namely, having a 24-hour resource. This is a matter on which the Garda respondents touched. They suggested the system was systematically inadequate and under-resourced and could not facilitate access to case files on particular children. There should be a 24-hour resource. Having a telephone line is simply not enough. There should be a real, substantial resource.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> The shocking revelations indicate a broken, dysfunctional system. We cannot just have periodic expressions of outrage and then move on. We need concrete action to make sure this will not happen again. Central to this is implementing the recommendations made, but we have to go beyond this. The report was excellent, but it covered a very discrete area of child protection, specifically related to section 12 of the Child Care Act. We have come across various issues in recent years in regard to Tusla. Public confidence in the agency is quite low. We are now compelled to consider the overall child protection picture. We would benefit greatly from an audit of the child protection system of the kind carried out by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. The Government should appoint a leading independent expert to head up such an audit, a much broader audit, across the range of child protection structures in place in the State.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Katherine Zappone)<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_524">I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I am conscious that Dr. Shannon's report has given rise to serious and understandable concerns and welcome the opportunity to set out the actions being taken. </p>
            <p eId="para_525"> Under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, An Garda Síochána has the power to remove a child urgently from a situation for his or her safety and welfare. Tusla social workers have no powers to enter a home or remove a child from a dangerous situation in an emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> The issues raised in Dr. Shannon's report can be summarised under the following headings: inter-agency co-operation and communication; the repeated application of section 12; section 12 and out-of-hours services; and the lack of suitable emergency accommodation, leading to young people being admitted to hospital or kept safe at Garda stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> On inter-agency co-operation and communication, Dr. Shannon's review examined PULSE data from 2008 to 2015, all cases where section 12 had been applied by An Garda Síochána in 2014 and a sample of cases where it had been applied in 2015. Since this time, Tusla has been fully established and set up processes to enhance inter-agency working. Both An Garda Síochána and Tusla confirm that there is excellent communication and co-operation at senior management level. It is recognised that there is always a need to ensure this is realised at local level. In order to address this, both organisations have recently developed a joint protocol on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 which I am assured will be signed off on by the two organisations very shortly. The joint protocol covers the application of section 12 and the process to be adopted during office hours and out-of-office hours as emergencies arise, in addition to notifications to Tusla.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> A dedicated Tusla official will be co-located at the Garda national child protection unit in the coming days. Divisional protective services units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions and effective liaison with Tusla will be a feature of these units.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> In addition to the high-level Garda and Tusla strategic liaison committee, Tusla has put in place dedicated intake teams that monitor and manage section 12 cases, including consideration of the repeated use of section 12. It has set up a team to review the contextual and situational factors and their actions in the 91 cases cited in Dr. Shannon's report and to consider the common themes arising. The actions in these specific cases and the overall concerns raised in the report will be examined by the Tusla team. The team will also consider specific cases to clarify the number of and reasons for repeat applications of section 12. The report will be completed by the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> With regard to the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place in November 2015. A national service now exists which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where the removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated. It facilitates emergency foster and residential care for children who are removed from their families under this provision. As part of this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and bank holidays to assist the Garda Síochána in the busiest areas of Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow. In light of Dr. Shannon’s report, I have asked Tusla to look at the current demand for a similar service in the rest of the country. Tusla will report back to me when it has reviewed this.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> In line with best child care practice, the majority of emergency accommodation is provided with foster family carers. This meets the needs of the majority of children admitted in an emergency situation. There are some situations where family care is not suitable, including where the young person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or is exhibiting suicidal ideation and may require medical assessment or treatment in hospital. I have been assured that social admission to hospital only takes place in exceptional cases and where such a placement is for the safety of the young person. I will be meeting Dr. Shannon within the coming week to discuss further the matters raised in his audit.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">I thank the Minister for her response. She spoke about the national service that came into being in 2015. I am not being flippant here, but there are more than four counties in Ireland. We have to look at the whole of Ireland and at the 26 counties. Where are we going to roll this out if it is already being called a national service at this moment in time? I personally believe that it is falling far short. We have to be looking throughout the whole of the country to know that we have a 24-hour service. The period in which most of these calls are made is from 10 p.m. at night to 3 a.m. in the morning. That is when An Garda Síochána is most needed to be called into service. Gardaí do not have proper training as child protection workers or social care workers. That is why we need to crank it up so that we have social care workers working 24 hours a day. We also need weekend cover. That is what the ISPCC keeps saying. We need weekend cover and cover after 5 p.m. as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> There needs to be a radical overhaul of the current system. I completely concur with what Deputy Ó Laoghaire is after saying. We should bring in Dr. Shannon to look at child protection in its entirety. We should not just focus in on section 12 cases. If we look back over the cases we have discussed in this House over the last number of weeks, we have talked about the Grace case and the Mary case. Child protection needs to be looked at in its entirety.</p>

            <p eId="para_534">I will pick up the first point raised by Deputy Rabbitte. Yes, there have been improvements in some counties in the out-of-hours social worker services and I recognise that there is a contact number for gardaí, but, as I said, gardaí have found it to be generally inadequate and under-resourced. It is an important issue. They have not been able to facilitate access to case files on particular children. That is my understanding at least from the respondents' answers. It hampers their ability to make informed decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> The Minister read the prepared full response and did not have the opportunity to respond to the audit point. I ask her to respond to that. I believe it is important as it would assist us. There are gardaí, social workers, people in management in Tusla and people in the Department doing their best, but a full audit of child protection services throughout the State is needed, rather than dealing with this in a piecemeal basis. I thank Deputy Rabbitte for her support on this call. It would allow us to take a step back, view the system in its entirety and offer us a roadmap to delivering a high-quality child protection service for the twenty-first century in order to be able to live up to the commitments of the children's referendum.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">I will first address the question of the sufficiency or adequacy of the out-of-hours services. As I already indicated, the establishment of full social work service teams in those four areas is something new and enhanced since the audit was undertaken in 2015. Why the four areas? Because that is where most of the cases occur. That enhancement also has to do with the establishment of Tusla and of seven regions for the purpose of having a social worker on call out of hours to engage directly with a child in particular circumstances. I heard Deputy Rabbitte saying that perhaps that is not sufficient. I know others are calling for it to be extended. I have asked Tusla to review the adequacy of the wider availability of speaking directly to a social worker in the other places where the use of section 12 are not as frequent. Tusla will give me an analysis and I will look at decisions on whether or not it is the most effective way to use resources throughout the country and have social work teams available everywhere for out-of-hours service when it may not be required from an efficiency perspective. At the same time, we must ensure that our children are protected. We are looking at it. It is one of the issues, but there has been an enhancement of the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> In response to Deputy Ó Laoghaire's point, since 2015 there has been improved access to the child protection register for An Garda Síochána. That was not the case before. Gardaí can get access to and take a look at a file to see what the risk of harm is for a particular child when they are making considerations with regard to section 12.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> With regard to Deputy Ó Laoghaire's question about a full audit of the child protection system, as always, I am willing to consider recommendations or suggestions from the Deputy. One of the first things I will ensure in the audit that we have - involving the inter-agency group of a strategic liaison committee between An Garda Síochána, Tusla and the HSE - is that we will take a look within a year's time at the recommendations, whether they have been implemented and whether they have been moved forward. In addition, as the Deputy knows, there are a number of other reviews that are going on in the context of Tusla. I need to look at those first before making a decision to call for a wider audit in order to see whether or not there would be overlap in that regard. However, I will consider the Deputy's suggestions on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_539">St. Catherine's Park, also known as Lucan Demesne, is a very beautiful regional park created in the Liffey valley. It serves three counties. Fingal is the largest part of it, followed by Kildare as well as Lucan in south County Dublin. It is a regional park for three counties. People have become very concerned in recent times as to whether or not a major new road may be built through the park. I have to say that one of my proudest achievements as a Minister in the 1990s, along with then Minister, Michael D. Higgins, was securing funding for the purchase of the lands at St. Catherine's Park in the Lucan Demesne from the farming family that had made it available for sale. Importantly, it is also in the Liffey valley amenity area, which is a protected area of amenity that is absolutely vital to the enormous populations that live in Dublin 15, from Castleknock out to Mulhuddart and Clonsilla, in Lucan, Palmerstown and north Clondalkin, and in Leixlip and the surrounding areas in Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> Controversy arose recently when it was discovered that an indicative road line in the Fingal county plan showed a major new road cutting through the Liffey valley right on the Dublin-Kildare border. The indicative line clearly shows that the road would basically slice straight through St. Catherine's Park, affecting the whole of the park, but - I have to be honest - particularly the Kildare side. The reason I want to raise this issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is that I am aware, as I am sure the Minister is in his own constituency, that people like road engineers and planners from time to time put down desire lines, indicative lines and such like on how we might have a major new road or road linkage in a particular spot but are oblivious to the concerns and interests of the local community. In this case, the N3 and the N4 to the west of Dublin might be linked by a road through this indicative line that would basically avoid the M50.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">The destruction of this wonderful regional park would be far too high a price to pay. If it was to go through, given the topography of the area with the Liffey located down in a valley with the heights on the south and north sides, it would effectively require another much larger high-level bridge over the Liffey so it would be extraordinarily expensive. </p>
            <p eId="para_542"> The existing indicative route could not only destroy St. Catherine's Park, it would bring HGV traffic into the Ongar-Littlepace area in Dublin 15 to the particular detriment of estates with thousands of families, including Beechfield, Blackwood and Littlepace. The Minister could set aside the fears of residents by making a clear statement. I want the Minister to ensure that notwithstanding various plans that may come from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Liffey valley amenity is preserved. In respect of the capital plan, which is inadequately funded, as the Minister is aware, I had no idea that we could spend ransom sums of money on a huge new bridge over the Liffey at this point. I would like to hear whether the Minister has been briefed on this and whether he is aware of it. I know he is very positive about parks and green spaces as amenities, as am I. I would like to get his assurances on this point. </p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_543">I thank the Deputy for raising this subject. On the surface, the destruction of amenities is something we must take very seriously. I accept what the Deputy has said, particularly if a park is in danger of being destroyed or divided and if communities are being badly affected. Have I been briefed on this? Today was the first time I knew about this so I have not been briefed on it in any detail but I am aware of it. The Deputy has put a strong case but she might be in the wrong place.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> I would like to clarify that link roads are generally regional or local roads and as the Deputy will be aware, the development and maintenance of such roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended. The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority concerned. Nonetheless the possibility that the lives of people in St. Catherine's Park could be ruined must be taken very seriously if this is a real plan. I know it is only an indicative plan at the moment. It is also a matter for the relevant local authority in its capacity as the planning authority for its area to consider and adopt a development plan. My Department has no function with regard to such matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> Where road projects are adopted, works are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. Arising from the arrangements in place relating to local property tax receipts, the four Dublin councils became self-funding for regional and local roads under the main road grant categories from 2015. These grant programmes cover general road maintenance and strengthening, safety improvement and bridge rehabilitation works. Provision was made in the capital plan for the upgrade of roads in the vicinity of Grange Castle Business Park and the Department is providing grant assistance for that strategic scheme. This is, however, the only strategic road project in the Dublin area being grant assisted at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> The NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, 2016-35 sets out principles for future road development in the GDA. The strategy refers to the future enhancement of orbital movement between the N3 and N4 by widening existing roads and the development of new road links. As I have outlined above, however, implementation of any such measures is a matter for the local authorities concerned. </p>
            <p eId="para_547"> Even though it is entirely a matter for the local authorities, my division made inquires of Fingal County Council today and got some information that the proposed link between the N3 and N4 has been a specific objective of Fingal's county development plan since 2005. The road proposal is shown on sheet 13 of the current Fingal development plan 2017-23. A small portion of the road proposal is also indicated in table seven of the current development as road schemes N3 and N4 link Ongar to Barnhill. This would allow for access to zoned residential lands to the south of Hansfield train station on lands known as Barnhill. All road proposals in the county development plan are indicative. The N3-N4 link road is an indicative line on the development plan and no detailed route alignment map with a selection of road between the N4 and the approved road alignment within the zoned lands at Barnhill is available for inspection on the Fingal website.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_285">

            <p eId="para_548">I thank the Minister for his reply and for taking an interest in this proposal. This is a park of under 200 acres in an area with the most enormous population growth. I invite the Minister to see it because the Liffey runs through it and there are plenty of opportunities for the Royal Canal and the Liffey to be linked via a pedestrian footbridge up at the Royal Canal and to expand a very significant walking, and possibly cycling, route for west Dublin and possibly continue it on the southside. This could eventually link up with the cycle way that is being developed in Dublin Bay via a Liffey route. We should exercise our imagination about the potential of this for people living in very heavily congested areas. This is an enormous amenity that is widely used. Admittedly, when I persuaded the then Government to acquire this land, a proposal supported by Michael D. Higgins, Bertie Ahern and John Bruton, it was with a view to providing an amenity for people.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> I hear what the Minister is saying, namely, that his Department has no role in respect of regional roads. He referenced the Hansfield development. Hansfield is a special development zone that has been zoned for over ten years which if completed, would provide for another 3,000 houses. Those houses would be very popular with people and I am totally in favour of that. However, the road entry that is required for that does not impact at all on Lucan Demesne or St. Catherine's Park. It is quite a distance away. It is the question of that route, which would be relatively small and which is needed to access the housing, not then being used as a Trojan Horse to create a linkage at that point and in St. Catherine's Park between the N3 and N4. If the council is telling the Minister that it needs the Hansfield access route to be developed, I would say "Yes" in the context of housing but that has nothing to do with that then passing over the Liffey or potentially destroying St. Catherine's Park. Although Fingal County Council has given the Minister information, what it has given him is not quite fair. I can certainly given the Minister more details. When he sees the detailed map, he will see what I mean.</p>

            <p eId="para_550">The only part of the road that is indicated on the current development plan is within the zoned lands at Hansfield-Ongar to serve the existing schools and residential development. A Part 8 procedure for local authority development has also provided for the design of a section of road to cross over the railway line south of this into zoned residential lands at Barnhill. No work has been done on the construction of this section of road to date and no further design or route options further south have been commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">If it is any comfort to the Deputy, I am sure she will already know that any impact on the Liffey valley and St. Catherine's Park, to which she referred, would be carefully considered in any design process or route options.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> Furthermore, any project of the likely scale required for the proposed road would have to follow the processes required under various EU directives and related Irish legislation, including the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive and the habitats directive. These environmental assessments must take account of a number of environmental receptors and themes, including landscape, cultural heritage, biodiversity, impact on humans, material assets, air and noise. They must also look at realistic alternative options and set out the preferred option. This will be subject to public consultation in the future. This is all set out in legislation. There has to be an integral and transparent part of any decision-making process for the identification of any proposed new road route and design. As I outlined above, no process has started for this road proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important issue here this evening. I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath - who has been a champion of disability rights for years - is answering it, but I do not know how he is going to answer this one, because it is just not very fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> Under the Disability Act 2005, the assessment of need must begin no later than three months after receiving a completed application and be completed no later than three months after the date it begins. In December 2016, a constituent of mine who was told that her daughter would be waiting 12 months for an assessment of needs made a complaint to the disability complaints officer. At that time, she had complaint number 1,111 about the application of the assessment of need process, and she was told that there was a five to six month delay in even responding to complaints. I ask the Minister of State, for God's sake, if that is right in this day and age? Her complaint was received in December 2016, and now, in May 2017, she is still months from her complaint even being heard. This child was referred for an assessment of need in May 2016. We are only one day from the end of May 2017, and there is no sign of any assessment of need coming down the tracks. It is now likely that it will be May 2018 before the child is assessed. That is shocking.</p>
            <p eId="para_555"> Just yesterday, I had two separate calls from parents whose children are attending child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, with severe social anxiety and other mental health issues. These children have been referred to the early intervention and disability services team for an assessment of needs, but they have been told not to expect one for 12 to 18 months. These children are due to start secondary school in September and have no services. Even the fact that they have received urgent referrals from CAMHS should be sufficient to ensure these children are seen to, but that is not sufficient. There are major issues even after the assessment, where children who have been assessed are left waiting for occupational therapy, speech and language, and physiotherapy, among other services. What are we doing?</p>
            <p eId="para_556"> The issue with staff vacancies has compounded an already dreadful situation in Clonmel, south Tipperary, and throughout the county and it needs to be addressed urgently. What is the HSE doing to ensure that these vacancies are filled? The last Topical Issue matter here was about children's rights and the abuse of children in Tusla. Legislation on children was passed here. The Government campaigned for a referendum which I campaigned against, and children have been flagrantly violated. It is just as bad again to allow children on the autism spectrum and with many other disabilities to be in a situation where they cannot even get a diagnosis. If they can get a diagnosis, then at the age of 11 or 12, they cannot get any support when intending to attend secondary school. This is outrageous and it is happening on the Minister of State's watch. When he was on this side of the House, he was always jumping up and down about these issues, and rightly so. I want to know now what he is going to do about these services. It is appalling.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> When some people telephone the HSE, they are told that services have been suspended. I heard from Mr. Chris Monahan, the senior manager there, that it is not suspended, but the services may as well be suspended, because one has to wait 12 or 15 months. When one makes a complaint, that person finds that he or she might be placed at 1,111 on the list of complaints. There are over 1,100 complaints in Tipperary alone. How in God's name are we going to deal with that system? How is the Minister of State going to make a difference to this situation? We have layers of bureaucracy. We have all chiefs and no Indians. When is the Minister of State going to get physiotherapists, occupational therapy specialists and other people in place with the necessary qualifications to deal with the rights that these children and their parents are entitled to? It cannot not just be lip service and people being fobbed off and told to wait until next year. These children cannot wait. They need these services now. I ask the Minister of State to make some meaningful reply and not read out a load of waffle and spin from the Department, because I will not accept it.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I will not read out any spin. I will deal with the facts and lay on the line exactly what is happening. I am pleased to respond and update the Deputy and the House on the progress under way in developing services for children with disabilities and the current position on waiting times for assessment of need, in particular with regard to the disability services in South Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> Under the Disability Act 2005, a child can request an assessment of need. The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory timeframes which apply to the assessment of need process. I accept that as a valid argument. The number of applications for assessment under the Act has increased steadily each year since the Act was introduced. More than 6,000 applications were received country-wide last year. This compares with just over 1,000 in 2007. There are 6,000 applications in there. This increase has created a requirement for additional resources, particularly in the area of psychology, in order to meet the demand for assessments and the provision of therapies.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> There is an overall shortage of psychologists nationally and there is also a problem in south Tipperary. We accept that as a fact of life. There is, at present, a deficit in psychology services, a function which is essential for the completion of the assessment of need report. In October 2016, approval was given to recruit for an additional full-time senior psychologist post for the south Tipperary early intervention team. However, the recruitment process via the national recruitment service was unsuccessful. That is a problem that we have. The HSE has subsequently approved one full-time basic grade psychology position for south Tipperary. In the meantime, one has to deal with the crisis. In addition, the HSE in South Tipperary has had to engage a private psychologist, who is conducting four assessments per month, along with speech and language therapists. However, the south Tipperary psychology service for school-age children has been suspended on an interim basis, given ongoing staffing deficits and pending filling of posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> The HSE and I acknowledge the concerns of the Deputy and parents and we regret the difficulties in accessing assessment services. The local management in South Tipperary is working toward resolving this issue as quickly as possible. The current programme for partnership Government commits to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly in the areas of early assessment and intervention for children with special needs. The HSE has recognised that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively. I accept those points.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"> To this end, a major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities aged up to 18 years is well under way. The national programme, "Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People", from zero to 18, aims to bring staff from different service providers together into children’s disability network teams. Since 2014, the roll-out of the programme has entailed targeted investment of €14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with disabilities. The HSE service plan for 2017 commits to completing this process of reconfiguration by the end of this year and it is expected that this will have a significant and very positive impact on our ability to meet the needs of children and young people, and in particular on our ability to comply with statutory timeframes governing assessment of need.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">What services are there? They are services that we do not have. A total of 1,111 complaints were lodged. There are commitments that complaints would be heard at a certain time.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">They broke every commitment they gave. I am surprised at the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, because he has been passionate about disability rights over the years, giving me that kind of a reply which referred to the reconfiguration of services and stating that a private psychologist has been hired to conduct assessments of need, at four per month. With so many waiting, children will not see the psychologist until they are married or they are in their 80s or in their graves. It is a joke to give me this kind of an answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> This is ineptitude of the highest order. There are too many chiefs and not enough ordinary therapists. The HSE got approval to recruit but it failed to do so. It did not try very hard. Its people are more interested in recruiting managers for their staff and their own posts. It is the same in the case of nurses. Wards in hospitals have been closed because the HSE cannot get nurses. It can get plenty of managers and other officials but cannot get the staff for the services the Minister of State, under the children's rights legislation, is obliged to provide. It cannot get the therapists to provide these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> This is a disgraceful response to give me and the constituents of Tipperary, who I represent, as well as to other Deputies from all over the country. It is shameful to treat our children like this. We are paying them lip-service, as did the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who spoke before the Minister of State on other issues. We have all the regulations, CEOs, offices and Tusla.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> In this case, we have HSE staff. I was told last night there was no suspension of services but the Minister of State stated there was. Who is codding whom? The services are not there; they have been suspended. There is a total lack of engagement, a lack of interest and a lack of humanity in treating parents and children, especially heading into secondary school with all the pressures that brings, without even being seen by a psychologist, not to mention any support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> The Minister of State should have a big think tank. If there is to be a new Taoiseach next week, the Government will hold a mid-term review of the programme for Government. It is time the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Independent Alliance put their foot down and got services for those who are entitled to them.</p>

The reality is we have an issue of staffing and getting psychologists. The reality, which the Deputy ignored when he stated nothing is being done, is that €14 million has been invested in these services but I accept the point that it is not enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_574"> If one looks at the therapy services over the past 12 or 13 months, one will see an additional 275 were provided nationally. In south Tipperary, there is the additional full-time psychologist. I accept that it is not enough, and I take the Deputy's point in that regard, but it is wrong to say we are doing nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">My amendment has been ruled out of order under Standing Order 154. I contest that because the amendment is in line with the provisions of the Bill.

The provisions of the Bill are to ensure that Inland Fisheries Ireland has the power to bring summary proceedings, to provide for certain penalties and to provide for related matters. I contend that this amendment is in line with related matters because it relates directly to how the situation has arisen that this Bill is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">I will not oppose the passing of the Bill. It is required to correct a mistake that was made in 2010 when the original legislation was passed but it is important we discuss what happened to ensure this legislation is required. I thank the Minister for providing me with a report from the Department on some of the events that took place that led to this legislation being required. I have a concern in regard to the fact the problem with the 2010 legislation was identified by the Department's counsel in March 2015 and reiterated to the Department in April 2015 and that in May 2015 the Department sought advice from the Attorney General as to what it needed to do, but it took until February 2017 for the Attorney General to advise that emergency legislation was required and that Inland Fisheries Ireland did not have the power to take summary cases before the courts. There was almost a two-year period in regard to when the Attorney General was consulted about the problem with this legislation and to my mind, that is far too long for something like this to have gone unnoticed.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> While I accept there may be case law which provides that if the State was acting in good faith in carrying out prosecutions and was not aware there may be a problem with the legislation, the courts would uphold convictions that took place during that period, but there certainly is a serious doubt as to whether the State was acting in good faith in regard to any prosecutions taking place from March 2015. That is a serious situation. While case law might give some comfort to the Government, it is not acceptable that legislation should be let go on this long in that period. These are serious breaches of law in terms of pollution incidents and illegal fishing. I accept that totally. However, we must be sure that we have the legal power to prosecute people. When the issues are identified, they need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Two years is too long.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">I am of the same opinion. I have no issue with people being prosecuted for pollution or fish kills. I do not refer to that but to where those I represent were tending to the waterways, as they have always done. Indeed, we did not have as much flooding when they were tending to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Two and a half years ago they were cleaning out the watercourse. They were taking out timber that was blocking the river with the potential to cause flooding on the roads and even to wash away a bridge across the N24. They were brought in and prosecuted, with no legislation. They were servants of the State, doing work for the State. They were cleaning out the rivers to make sure that the water could flow and not flood property and roads and cause damage. When people come along in their suits, with their briefcases and badges we must ensure there is proper legislation. People should not have been hauled through the courts and made examples of, even if it was two years ago. Justice delayed is justice denied but this represents no justice at all for ordinary people. We are here to make that situation right and I am opposing this Bill and will vote against it for that reason.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">I thank Deputies for raising various issues. I note their concerns, which we discussed at length on Committee Stage. Deputy Mattie McGrath raised the question as to why concluded convictions are not affected. His amendment provides that "any person convicted or prosecuted prior to the commencement of this Act shall have their conviction erased and prosecution withdrawn". The finality of criminal convictions was addressed in the advice of the Office of the Attorney General. This advice is that there are no implications as regards cases already concluded and for which no appeal against conviction has been initiated within the statutory appeal period. In those cases, a conviction and penalty would stand. Following receipt of the Attorney General's advice in February 2017, IFI prosecutions that were pending at that time are not being proceeded with and are being withdrawn on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> In effect, this Bill aims to ensure that the intention of the law that was passed by the Dáil in 2010 is brought through now. Everything we do is done with the advice and guidance of the Attorney General's office. Legislation dealing with the removal of material from rivers includes the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 and the Local Authorities (Works) Act 1949, neither of which are affected by this Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_603"> In response to Deputy Pringle, while I appreciate the comments he has made, my Department provided a very thorough briefing to him following the Committee Stage debate, which I am happy to summarise now. The requirement to amend the principal Act arose from two court cases for pollution heard over 2015 and 2016 and the offences in question occurred in mid-2014. Due to various adjustments, it was July 2016 before the court found that the prosecution's case was appropriate and that IFI had proven its case against the accused. Originally the advice received from the Attorney General's office was to the effect that the Department may wish to consider whether an amendment to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 was appropriate in order to confirm the powers of IFI under that Act. It was important that both cases were concluded before any assessment of the implications of the legal challenges to IFI's powers and what legislative action, if any, was required, could be made. In any event, the issue of the challenge to the powers of IFI was not finally determined by the court. Following the conclusion of both cases, the Department set out to consider what legislative amendments would be necessary to confirm the powers of IFI under the 2010 Act, on the understanding that the powers of IFI were susceptible to challenge on a case-by-case basis and the legislative amendment required would confirm the relevant powers. This matter was not an urgent one at that stage and was pursued in line with a normal legislative timeframe. However, having prepared a draft general scheme of the Bill to confirm the powers of IFI, officials were notified on 9 February 2017, during consultation on that draft scheme by the Office of the Attorney General, that there was a more fundamental issue at play, namely, that the IFI did not have the power to prosecute and that a new draft Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill should be prepared to explicitly confer such rights and powers on the IFI. The Department was only made aware on 9 February 2017 that it is was not sufficient simply to confirm the powers of IFI but that there was a need for new legislation - this Bill - which has been progressed at speed since then.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill. The question of the delays has been raised and the Minister of State has answered that reasonably well. In passing this legislation, we must bear in mind that enforcement is the key. It is very important that the work of local voluntary angling clubs, who restock rivers and carry out local improvement works in conjunction with IFI, is protected. We have seen some terrible instances of pollution in recent times. The Clodiagh River in County Laois suffered serious pollution just over a year ago, which wiped out an enormous amount of fish. Enforcement is so important because pollution is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> There is an ongoing debate about drainage and the cleaning of rivers. Reference has been made to the problem of getting permission to remove obstructions from rivers. Those who argue against such removal do so on the basis of the need to protect fish stocks. Years ago bodies like the board of works and the drainage boards carried out substantial clearance works. I remember huge machinery in rivers such as the Nore and the Barrow but the fish stocks did not decline sharply. However, fish stocks and the variety of fish in our rivers have reduced drastically in more recent years and the main cause of this is pollution. This is the issue on which we must focus. I ask the Minister of State and his officials to take note of that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Sinn Féin supports this legislation. We must get on with it now. We need to get this Bill through the Houses and enacted with no further delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">I thank Deputy Stanley for his comments and for his support for the Bill. I agree that in the context of the conservation of fish stocks and the work that is done across the country by angling clubs to preserve and promote the angling potential of their local rivers, this legislation is important and necessary. In terms of removing obstacles from rivers there are other authorities that must be contacted including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and the Office of Public Works, OPW. In general, IFI has not stopped any removal of materials as long as that removal takes place at the correct time of the year. Under the national strategy for angling, funding will be available to angling clubs and community groups to support the works suggested by Deputy Stanley. Local authorities deal with permits for the cleaning of rivers or the removal of obstacles. The Department turns such applications around quickly. Again, I thank the Deputy for his support for the Bill and agree that it is important to proceed with it forthwith.</p>

We recognise its importance in dealing with a technical matter in order to ensure that those individuals who are not treating the waterways as we would like will be sanctioned and fined. We must recognise the importance of our inland fisheries resource, not just for people who live here and use our waterways for leisure pursuits but also for tourists. They are a very important aspect of our overall tourism offering and it is vital that we retain and maintain the image of our waterways and fisheries as premium products. While there are issues about which we might quibble from time to time, it is important that this legislation is passed quickly. In that context, Fianna Fáil has engaged with the Minister of State and his Department in trying to move this Bill through the House quickly. We welcome the open approach of both the Minister of State and his Department and would like to see this Bill become law as soon as possible.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_619">I wish to share my time with Deputy John McGuinness. I will speak for 12 minutes and he will have eight minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill. For the past number of years we have been calling for and proposing specific measures to improve consumer protection for persons who purchase financial services products. It is worth reminding ourselves why stronger consumer protection is needed in this sector. We have seen banks and lenders in this country undoubtedly treating customers very shoddily in recent years. We have had a number of examples of that. As a party we have consistently highlighted the high standard variable interest rates to which mortgage holders in Ireland are subject, particularly by certain banks. Most recently we have had the tracker mortgage scandal where thousands of customers were denied their contractual right to return to a tracker mortgage interest rate following a period of time on a fixed interest rate. We know in some cases that this has cost families their home and in other cases families incurred very serious financial costs for which they cannot be recompensed given the impact it had on their quality of life at that time. Those are just some of the reasons strong financial regulation is required to protect consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Fianna Fáil welcomes this Bill and will be supporting its passage through Second Stage. The Bill essentially provides for amalgamating the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into one single Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. This move in itself is worthwhile as clearly a pension is a financial product and I believe this will clear up much of the complexity around the area of consumer complaints. This Bill is in many ways inspired by the Redressing the Imbalance report published by the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, in 2014. This report is a comprehensive piece of work that has played a substantial role in the debate on consumer protection across the financial services industry. FLAC and the authors of that report need to be commended for the extensive work they have done and in respect of other projects around legal protection for individuals who purchase products.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> Fianna Fáil's Bill on this area predates that 2014 report but also sought to address some of the issues highlighted in it. The Sinn Féin Bill passed Report Stage last week. I would like to again commend Deputy Pearse Doherty on his work on that Bill. We are also pleased to support that Bill, which addresses the issue of the six-year rule, and we brought forward our own legislation on that issue previously. </p>
          <p eId="para_623"> However, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a concern that we have, which I mentioned during the later stage of the debate on the Sinn Féin Bill last week, namely, the need to ensure that we have consistency regarding the terms and conditions that govern access to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, clarified last week that the Government Bill, when it is eventually enacted, will supersede the Sinn Féin legislation, which is likely to become law first. We have to ensure that the terms governing the Statute of Limitations, also known as the six-year rule, are treated consistently so that we do not have one cohort of customers accessing the ombudsman under one regime and then a new item of legislation replacing that with new terms. We need consistently, and that is very much our position on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> A further concern I would have is that by merging the two bodies we must ensure that we are not in any way diminishing the service that they provide currently separately to society. This change must not lead to a reduction in the quality of services that they provide. The new ombudsman must be adequately funded and resourced to do the job that it has been asked to do. Will the establishment of this new ombudsman lead to a hike in the levy charged on financial service companies? That is an important question that needs to be answered because, as we all know, ultimately these levies get passed back to the end consumer who has to pick up the bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> There are a few very important provisions in this Bill that I believe everyone in the House will support. According to the FLAC report in 2014, the legal definition of "consumer" was deemed to be too loose. The ombudsman’s primary goal is to provide a strong appeal and complaint process for small businesses, clubs, partnerships and individuals. With the definition of the consumer tightened up in this Bill it ensures that the ombudsman will be solely accessed and have its services used by these people. </p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The Bill covers any individual acting outside the course of business. It covers a sole trader, partnership, trust, club or charity with an annual turnover of €3 million or less in the previous year. The Bill also covers small incorporated companies with a turnover of €3 million or less in the previous year. This is a welcome development as it guarantees that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman will be there for the people who need it the most, the people who do not have the ability or resources to go straight to the courts system.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Another major criticism of the current system lies in the area of the six-year rule, an issue on which I have spoken many times in this House. </p>
          <p eId="para_628">Today a customer has six years from the date the alleged offence or subject matter took place to make a complaint. This is wholly inadequate. First, it is regularly much later when a customer realises that an offence has taken place but by then it is too late to make a complaint, leaving the customer in the lurch and, quite possibly, out of pocket. This Bill seeks to address the matter by extending the time limit for pensions and long-term financial products. Where a complaint relates to pensions or a long term financial product - we had a debate last week about what constitutes a long-term financial product - the six-year period can be extended to up to three years after the complainant knew, or ought reasonably to have known, about the alleged offence. Further, the ombudsman has a discretionary power, in certain circumstances, to extend the limitation period for pension and long-term financial service complaints where he or she considers it just and equitable to do so. There is a baseline provided for in this respect from 2002 onwards in the Bill. This is again a welcome development. However, I would strongly urge that this is regularly monitored to assess if it is having a desired effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> It would be interesting to see over time how often the ombudsman decides to use this discretionary provision. Specifically, it may highlight areas where the current provisions in this Bill may have to be improved. I spoke last week about the mis-selling of payment protection insurance policies. The Central Bank carried out an investigation and consumers who bought from 1 July 2007 onwards and who qualified got some compensation. All those who bought prior to July 2007 are currently excluded from claiming compensation but I hope and expect that people who were genuinely mis-sold a product from 2002 to 2007 will have the potential to gain access to the ombudsman under the provisions of this Bill. These changes are welcome and it ensures customers are given adequate opportunity to make a complaint against the financial service or pension provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> To move to more functional areas and the operational elements, the Bill removes the Financial Services Ombudsman's bureau, the Financial Services Ombudsman council and the office of the Pensions Ombudsman. Complaints will now be overseen by a new financial services and pensions ombudsman and it will cover a wide range of financial products. This will simplify the whole complaints process. The ombudsman will be overseen by a newly established financial services and pensions ombudsman council, which will assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the ombudsman and will determine the levy on financial service providers. This will partly fund the ombudsman but make no mistake, it will not be the financial service providers who foot this bill; as I stated earlier, the customer will do it and that is why we must ensure this is carefully monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> The newly established financial services and pensions ombudsman will be tasked with overseeing the complaints process. Its primary function is to receive and resolve complaints relating to financial products, long-term financial products and pensions. The ombudsman is still required to act "in an informal manner” and "without undue regard to technicality and legal form". In the 2014 Free Legal Advice Centres report, this was highlighted as potentially encouraging complacency in the ombudsman and as a result it led to investigations that were unsatisfactory for the complainant. This amendment appeared on Second Stage in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 from last week but was removed from that Bill. As it does not appear in this Bill, the Minister of State might clarify intentions in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The Bill outlines the different ways the ombudsman can facilitate a settlement to each complaint. Very often mediation has proven to be very successful at reaching a resolution to many complaints and this process should be encouraged in the appropriate circumstances. Where mediation is not possible, the new ombudsman, similarly to the Financial Services Ombudsman, will be able to undertake a full investigation. The ombudsman will have extensive powers in this regard. For example, the ombudsman will have the power to require attendance and compel the relevant parties to provide documentation that is relevant to the complaint. Again, in the 2014 report it was discovered when an oral hearing was not held by the ombudsman, many complainants felt they were denied their day in court, as such, where they could deal with the financial service provider face to face. Under this Bill, the newly established ombudsman will have flexibility and discretion when it comes to holding oral hearings. I urge the ombudsman to be cognisant of this issue when making such decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> No complaints mechanism is worth the paper it is written on unless there are sufficient powers to arrive at a decision and to order financial redress to the complainant if found in his or her favour. These powers are enhanced with this Bill. First, under the new regime there will a number of possible decisions from the ombudsman, including that the complaint may be substantiated, not substantiated and partly substantiated in one or more specified respects, for example. A substantiated decision means the financial service provider not only has broken the law but has unreasonably done so and was improperly or unjustly motivated. The compensation ceiling is currently set at €250,000. I have a concern that in some cases this ceiling may be too low and would urge the council and the Minister to regularly review this ceiling to ensure customers are being compensated in full for the cost of complaints that have been upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> The decisions of the ombudsman will be published in anonymised form. This is important so there is transparency in the process and everyone can see the type of complaints that are being brought to the ombudsman. This is important for individuals who feel they have been poorly treated but may lack the confidence to proceed with a complaint. Further serial offenders against whom three or more complaints are wholly or partially substantiated in a year will be named and shamed, and this is a power we sought as well. This is a welcome power to give the ombudsman as it will serve to encourage financial providers to take consumer protection seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> In summary, Fianna Fáil welcomes this Bill as an important step in the right direction to strengthen the protections available to consumers. We look forward to engaging in a process when this Bill comes to Committee and Report Stages.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_636">I also welcome the Bill, the various changes that will support the consumer and the definition of "financial services". We must reflect on exactly what will happen. Amalgamating an office and putting this office in place is only one step in the right direction. The next step is seeing how seriously the ombudsman will take up the legislation and implement its various parts. In the past we have seen that as a country we are almost incapable of regulation. We must reflect on what happened in the banks and other financial institutions during the collapse. We had legislation, an ombudsman and regulators in place but when it came to it, no risk manager was ever challenged within the banking system as to whether they saw anything going wrong in the banks that they should have reported to the regulator or Central Bank. I still pose the question, as many do, as to what action was ever taken to find out if risk managers ignored the signs in the financial institutions at that time so that the collapse that happened could have been averted, along with the burden of debt heaped on the Irish citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> In his evidence to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, Mr. Jonathan Sugarman made it perfectly clear that he and his superiors went to the Central Bank and the complaint was made and lodged but never followed up. Look at the banks that went bust and the rescue package that had to be put in place, yet nobody has answered the central question of what risk managers did relative to the legislation and their obligations at that time. Judging from Central Bank reports, we must ask ourselves the very same question now. Are there practices in the banks that give rise to the concern shared by others over the years relating to the activities of the bank?</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> When we move from the banks to the consumer we can see the number of complaints that have been made, for example, relating to insurance. Insurance for property, cars and trucks has increased and taxi drivers complain bitterly. A submission was made to me by the taxi drivers who service Dublin Airport, which come in or out of town at a general fee or charge of €20. Against that, their monthly cost for insurance has risen from €100 to €150 to €290 per month. Where is the explanation for that or the action of the regulator or Central Bank given the complaints being made? Why is it that people coming home from abroad cannot get cover or driving history recognised?</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Why are businesses throughout the country threatened because of insurance costs? They cannot afford them. The Minister has a report and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has a report yet nothing concrete has been done to reduce the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Many of the complaints made have not been processed to the extent that action has been taken arising from them. The same goes for the pension funds, and one could speak of the ward of court funds in the same regard. Who will monitor these funds? What responsibility will the ombudsman or this office undertake to ensure in reality that the wrongs we have experienced in the course of the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach are addressed? The consumer feels unrepresented, and the argument put forward by the Central Bank or those responsible for consumer issues is less than convincing. In fact, when some of the tracker mortgage issues were raised with the banks, in the beginning they did very little - everything, in fact, not to address the issue. Now that the issue has been exposed and is being dealt with, again through the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the banks are still doing their best not to take on their full responsibility. There are individual tracker mortgage holders out there who still cannot get themselves included in the review process even though everything written down in their cases would point to the fact that they should be in the process. There has been the Ulster Bank Global Restructuring Group, and Ulster Bank has questions to answer about that. The commitments it gave regarding actions it would take were never fulfilled. It then uses the power of its might to deal with the customers, and the customer again feels unrepresented.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> I point the Minister of State to what happened recently with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Why in the name of God did that happen? I ask the House to consider all the other regulators, including the regulator with the bank, and consider what happened. It seems the citizen is shortchanged all the time and as soon as the banks and other institutions can get to their feet and get themselves covered, they again turn around and kick the customer. They do not observe customer rights in most cases and, in fact, in general, pay lip-service to the committee system of these Houses. As a result, the customer does not get the rate that should be applied and the families concerned have to carry the brunt of poor administration in this country. We seem to be incapable or institutionalised to the extent that nothing matters but the institution itself. Now, as we sell the State's shares in AIB and begin to release them from public ownership, we are throwing further to the wolves those who are in debt to those banks and who cannot get to grips with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I wish to point to the courts system and the cases that end up there. The repossession courts are an absolute disgrace, and we have not addressed that problem. As a result, thousands of cases are poorly managed by the bank and ignored by regulators and anyone else who took the complaints from the individuals concerned. Citizens of this country are being forced to go to court as defendants when the State has abandoned them in the first place. This is the kind of strong regulation we need. We need strong regulation, we need strong legislation and we need strong personalities not to be afraid of the might of the banks but to put the citizen at the centre of their thinking regarding the implementation of this law or any other laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> When one looks back on the financial collapse, what was sold and the various accountancy organisations that stood over what was being sold, stood over the poor regulation and stood over the breaking of laws and did not regulate their own members, is it any wonder we are where we are today?</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceQuinlivan" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_644">Sinn Féin welcomes the Bill. I speak on behalf of Deputy Pearse Doherty, who sends his apologies. This is a Bill of two parts. First, it merges the Offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman and, second, it overhauls much of the consumer protection rules when it comes to making complaints. Of most importance is the removal of the so-called six-year rule. This second part has been debated a great deal because much of it is found in Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill, which is now awaiting a Seanad reading.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> I will return to that content, but it is worth considering first the merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and Financial Services Ombudsman. It is important that this merger does not pass without scrutiny as the other details of the Bill are discussed. In this country, we have become so used to the language of austerity that words such as "merger" set off alarm bells for many of us that the real intent is cuts. After all, there seemed to be no democratic demand for such a merger. The basis seems to be the regulatory impact assessment by Mr. Hinz of the World Bank, who concluded there was no compelling evidence of negative consequences. This is a very weak basis on which to proceed with merging two very important bodies that protect consumers. After all, when we consider the tracker scandal and the PPI scandal, can we really say this is the right time to tinker around with the consumer protection bodies of the State? This is not to mention the rip-off being carried out by insurers on drivers, small businesses, home owners and now community groups and facilities day in, day out.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Reform of consumer protection law is required, and this opportunity could have been used to take a more radical approach. The strict power of the ombudsman to only rule on what is legal as opposed to what is fair frustrates many people, and this frustration is understandable. The Central Bank does not want to hear from individuals, and the ombudsman can only stick to narrow legal battles. That is the situation for consumers in this country: when something stinks, everyone smells it but no one seems to be able to do anything about it. This merger should not and cannot put consumers at a disadvantage relative to where they are today. That means ensuring the new office is properly resourced at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> As I said, much of the Bill complements Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill. The Dáil has already spoken on a number of issues in this regard and it only makes sense that those decisions are reflected in this Bill. It is in no one's interest that we have conflicting pieces of legislation one after the other. Regarding the six-year rule, which is of huge public interest, it is important that the public is not let down by the small print. The proposal before us in this Bill excludes many people who rightly believe they should have their day before the ombudsman. The definition used in this Bill, excluding as it does annually renewable products and unilaterally cancellable policies, is far too narrow. It goes against the spirit of what this House wants and it needs to be changed. This is an area where my party will table amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> The Bill also represents a big step forward in making mediation the rule, not the exception. This mirrors the reality on the ground whereby the Financial Services Ombudsman has vastly increased the use of mediation. I note the Minister successfully amended Deputy Doherty's Bill to mirror this section 58. The Bill also differs on the issue of the window in which an appeal can be made to the High Court. The Government Bill seems to go along with the standard rules of the court which allows 21 days as a rule although recognising the right of the courts to be flexible. Deputy Doherty managed to win the support of the Dáil for a 35-day window, so this should be reflected here in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> I warmly welcome the new provisions allowing the Ombudsman to publish findings in full. This is a significant improvement. As the Minister knows and as he has accepted, Deputy Doherty's Bill brought in a new range of findings so that now there are four possible findings instead of three. Again, I see no reason this Bill should not follow the Dáil's view on that issue. My party supports the Bill and will engage fully through amendments on Committee Stage. However, the issue of the merger is not a foregone conclusion for us and the rationale given so far is quite weak.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_650">Regarding the Bill, which seeks to merge the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman with those of the Pensions Ombudsman, I and my Solidarity colleagues need to hear some guarantees on the issue of resources and staffing before we can give any measure of support.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> A case can be made that the intermeshing of pensions and other financial products is a reality and that the same private financial institutions span both areas and that, therefore, having two separate ombudsman offices may not make sense. However, the genesis of the Bill lies in the previous Government's public services reform plan, the brief of the steering group for which was to merge and cull various Government offices, with a view to reducing overall public service numbers. Some of the recommendations made by the group are highly objectionable from a policy perspective such as the downgrading of the Irish Human Rights Commission. Overall, the approach of reducing the number of people delivering public services is one we oppose.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> In the case of the office of the Pensions Ombudsman, prior to the proposed merger it has dealt with understaffing issues, while at the same time witnessing an increase in its caseload of almost 80% between 2011 and 2015. If anything, the merged entity should have an increased staffing level to deal promptly with complaints that come to its door. I challenge the Minister of State to detail the resources the office will have available to it. It would be remiss of us to debate the topic of having a statutory office to deal with the massive increase in pension related complaints without getting to the root source of the crisis in the private occupational pensions system. In the final analysis what use is it to perfect a complaints procedure when the problems are systemic? </p>
          <p eId="para_653"> Under capitalism, we are going backwards. Despite the rise in productivity achieved on the basis of technology which, if we had a sanely organised economy, should mean that the economically active population could easily support those in retirement, what do we have instead? I have figures from the Pensions Authority which show the dramatic decline in the number of defined benefit pensions in the private sector and the number of people covered by these schemes since 1991. The high point in the number of schemes during that time period was 1992, when there were 2,533 schemes. In 2015 there were a mere 715 schemes, of which 163 were frozen, while scores more underfunded. As for the number of workers covered, the high point was reached in 2006 when 269,529 workers were covered. Subsequently, there has been a catastrophic decline of more than half the number of workers covered to 125,955, well below the number in any period in the 1990s when the workforce was half of what it is today. </p>
          <p eId="para_654"> What can be deduced from this? Simply put, any private sector defined benefit pension scheme that is confined to one workplace, or even one branch of industry, as in the case of the construction sector, is doomed because of the demographic changes that take place within firms and branches of industry, leaving progressively fewer people paying into the funds and greater numbers of retired persons drawing from them. The ESB is a case in point. At one point, it employed 15,000 people and for the first four decades of its existence it had relatively few drawing from the pension scheme. Today, thanks to progressive job cuts and outsourcing, it has fewer than 4,000 employees and is projected to have 2,000 in the medium term, with multiples of that number drawing from the pension scheme. The solution is not to meekly accept the massacre of occupational pension schemes but rather to have a unified and society-wide occupational pension scheme into which the State pension would be fully integrated, as in the case of civil and public servants. Only this type of arrangement can deal with the demographic shifts that are inevitable within and between the different branches of the workforce. </p>
          <p eId="para_655"> The former Minister for Social Production, Deputy Joan Burton, made an announcement in 2013 that a universal pension scheme would be established for private sector workers. On the surface, it could have been a step in dealing with the crisis many workers without pensions will face on retirement, but, of course, it never happened. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, was asked by the former Minister to come up with recommendations by February 2013 for how such a scheme would work. The OECD is one of many international institutions the publications and commentary of which consistently seek to drive a pro-capitalist agenda. I do not have time to go into the eventual recommendation with which it came up, but the parameters it was set by the then Minister were very flimsy. Essentially, similar to the scheme that was supposed to be in place in the construction sector, the Government suggested every employee in the private sector automatically opt into a pension scheme which would be supervised by the National Treasury Management Agency and that deductions be made from wages, alongside contributions from employers to fund pensions. The then Minister went on to say it was not the time to introduce such a scheme but that it could be implemented when the recovery happened. There is still no sign of it today.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> There are a number of major problems that need to be addressed in how pension schemes are run for private sector and semi-State sector workers. First, the private pensions industry, to be blunt, amounts to daylight robbery. In October 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, published a damning report which revealed that private pension companies were siphoning off up to 30% of funds in various administrative charges and that the smaller the number of workers paying into a particular scheme the higher the deductions. What PwC did not mention was the additional waste of resources by private pension companies engaging in competitive advertising. Second, the investment decisions of private pension firms proved to be a disaster in the course of the crisis. The investment practices of schemes run by firms operating in Ireland are among the least regulated in Europe. In a 2009 report the OECD highlighted that Irish-run funds had lost an average of 37.5%, compared to 16.8% in Denmark where risky investments were limited by regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate. The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017 will establish a new office that will amalgamate the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman. The Bill will provide for the investigation and resolution of complaints by a number of means, including internal procedures, mediation and formal investigations. The range of financial services covered has been extended to include creditors not otherwise subject to regulation by the Central Bank such as, for example, pawnbrokers and certain hire purchase and mortgage lenders. The Bill will also consolidate the statutory arrangements for handling consumer complaints about financial services, pensions and related products and provide for the staffing and oversight of the merged offices. It will also define the power and functions of the new ombudsman and establish a new council that will oversee the functioning of the ombudsman's office. It is clear that the amalgamation of the offices will not significantly reduce the overall costs of the running of the services, but it will allow for the sharing of expertise and a greater pooling of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> It is important to make reference to the review carried out by Bearingpoint management consultants. As part of the amalgamation process, Bearingpoint was commissioned to undertake a strategic and operational review of the practices and procedures of the two bodies. It found a number of difficulties, including, in the case of the Pensions Ombudsman, a loss of skilled personnel and, in the case of the Financial Services Ombudsman, a lack of flexibility, transparency and customer orientation. The review also identified problems in both offices caused by the length of time it was taking to resolve cases. It recommended a number of proposals, including increased resources for mediation and a greater sharing of information with stakeholders so as to highlight customer protection issues and increase awareness of how to address potential issues before they became systemic. </p>
          <p eId="para_659"> I would like to highlight some provisions included in the Bill which I believe it is important for the public to understand and of which they need to be made aware. The new office will be funded by way of a levy on financial service providers in the case of complaints about financial service providers and moneys will be provided by the Oireachtas to deal with complaints against pension scheme providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Future appointments to the position of ombudsman and deputy ombudsman will be made by the sitting Minister for Finance following consultation with the sitting Minister for Social Protection from among persons selected by the Public Appointments Service. I trust that this will lead to a transparent selection process. The maximum term of office of an ombudsman or deputy ombudsman will be five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The functions of the ombudsman as set out in the Bill will be to investigate complaints in an appropriate manner proportionate to the nature of the complaint by either informal means, mediation, formal investigation, including oral hearings if required, or a combination of these approaches. Other functions of the ombudsman will include improving public knowledge or understanding of the role of the ombudsman in the types of disputes he or she may handle. The ombudsman will also be charged with engaging with financial institutions and pensions providers to promote active engagement and consumer education in respect of their internal dispute resolution practices and processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> It is important to set out the role of the financial services and pensions ombudsman council. The primary role of the council will be to oversee the operation of the ombudsman and provide funding by means of a levy on financial services providers. The council will replace the current Financial Services Ombudsman Council and comprise between five and seven members, including the chairperson. In practical terms, the current chair and members shall be deemed to assume equivalent positions on the new council on its establishment. All subsequent members are to be recommended by the Public Appointments Service and appointed by the Minister for Finance except for one ordinary member who will be the nominee of the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I welcome the fact the chairperson will be required to have knowledge and experience of consumer issues relating to the provision of either financial services or pension services. I also welcome the fact that at least two ordinary members of the board are to have experience of consumer protections issues relating to financial services and that at least two of the ordinary members are to have experience in the financial services and pensions industries, respectively. This represents a considerable increase in consumer representation on the board. The functions of the board will include the following. It will determine and prescribe the financial services industry levy. It will oversee the efficiency and effectiveness of the office and advise the sitting Minister for Finance on matters relating to it. The board will also advise the ombudsman when requested including on guidelines for complaints processes and investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I am pleased the Bill clearly identifies who can make a complaint under the legislation. Complainants may include a consumer, an actual or potential beneficiary or a person acting on his or her behalf, or a person specified by way of ministerial regulations. An actual or potential beneficiary includes a current or former member of a pension scheme. While I welcome the Bill, I have concerns about public awareness of the measures available to people who believe they have been mistreated in matters relating to either financial services or pensions. I have dealt with a number of cases on behalf of constituents in Dundalk and Drogheda where it was obvious they had been treated unfairly by a financial institution or pension provider. The remedies available to them were inadequate and in many cases the people concerned were afraid to take on large institutions on foot of the perception that one simply cannot win in such circumstances. I hope the Bill will help to address some of the issues faced by my constituents and others throughout the country who feel they have been treated unfairly by financial institutions.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Seán Kyne)<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_665">I thank the Deputies for their contributions and constructive engagement on the Bill. The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will be involved in the more detailed consideration of its provisions on Committee Stage. Everyone can agree that the Bill is important and will be a milestone in the further development of consumer protection legislation. I will respond to some of the issues raised by Deputies in the course of the debate and we will have an opportunity to deal with other matters on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> Deputy Michael McGrath referred to the need for adequate funding and resources for the office and also asked for an increase in the levies on financial services providers. The levies are a significant element of the funding of the office and will be prescribed by the council under section 43. It will be a matter for the council to ensure the ombudsman has adequate funding but the amount of the levy must not exceed the sums necessary to fund the operation of the office under section 43(4). Funding in relation to pension complaints will come from funds provided by the Oireachtas as heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> Deputy Quinlivan referred to the rationale for the amalgamation of the offices. This was set out in a recommendation of the 2013 report and amended by the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, in 2013. The lines between financial services products and pension products are increasingly blurred and some pensioners would not be able to complain to the Pensions Ombudsman if the product they were sold was in fact a financial service. To reply to Deputy McGuinness, court proceedings can be stayed to allow the ombudsman to investigate a complaint. That might be relevant in some repossession cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> As discussed, the most important provision in the Bill is a proposal to extend the time limits to complain to the ombudsman. There is a strong rationale for the changes set out in the Bill which extends the time limits for complaints about conduct in relation to a long-term financial service to the same time limit that applies to pension products, namely, six years from the date of the conduct complained of or three years from the date the complainant knew or ought reasonably to have known about the conduct. The Government's definition of "long-term financial service" in section 2 is intended to include many long-term financial services products and also income-continuance policies. Our understanding is that there is a standard clause in these income continuance policies whereby providers cannot unilaterally cancel them. This is to ensure that providers cannot just cancel a policy when a customer becomes ill. We may wish to review the clause on Committee Stage to ensure that it captures our intention correctly and is not open to misinterpretation. I am sure Members will also want to ensure that this occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> For short-term financial services, the time limit for a complaint to the ombudsman remains unchanged at six years from the date of the conduct complained of. Examples of the short-term services in this category are car insurance, home insurance and travel insurance. Six years from the date of the conduct should be sufficient time to make a complaint on issues because the service will most likely be concluded within that timeframe. Furthermore, if short-term annual products were to be considered long-term in nature, it would place a larger administrative burden on companies which might have to insure against the cost of possible future claims resulting in higher costs for customers. This is not an outcome any Member of the House would want when many of us have worked hard to address higher costs in recent months. It is critically important that we do not inadvertently legislate for actions that result in higher costs for consumers which would become embedded in the insurance industry and in premium costs in the years ahead. Long-term financial services include mortgages and tracker mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> When the heads of the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny last October, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014, which was introduced by Deputy Pearse Doherty, was also reviewed and debated by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. The Private Members' Bill aims to provide for the strengthening of the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the consumer complaints procedure and related matters. Many of the principles of the Bill are also represented in the Bill before the House. We welcome the progress of Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill, which passed the Final Stage in the Dáil last Tuesday, 23 May, and now proceeds to the Seanad. A significant amount of work has been done by Sinn Féin on its Bill which took into account many of the issues we debated during pre-legislative scrutiny and other Stages and this must be commended. A good engagement was also had with officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> As the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said on Report Stage of the 2014 Bill, however, we have some concerns about Deputy Doherty's definition of long-term financial services. We are concerned it might include a wide range of policies or services which are subject to annual renewal or policies which are not and cannot be considered to be of long-term duration. We are concerned that the impact of this very wide definition of long-term financial services might increase the cost of policies like car insurance or house insurance because insurance companies would be mindful of the possibility of claims being taken in a longer timeframe. As a result, they would pass additional costs to consumers. These costs would relate first to the administrative burden of keeping records for longer and second to the requirement to carry insurance against more possible future claims in a longer time period. In addition, there is concern that providers could deter their short-term customers from becoming long-term customers under Deputy Doherty's definition. They might refuse to cover customers after a five-year period or in the alternative increase annual premiums substantially after a five-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> As Deputies know, the high cost of insurance was debated on a number of occasions in the House, including as recently as Wednesday, 17 May. Increased costs are not an outcome any Member would want. We will have to review the definition of "long-term financial services" again in advance of Seanad Committee Stage to ensure there are no unintended adverse consequences for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I am keen to avoid any potential misinterpretations and misunderstandings by copperfastening the meaning of "short term" and "long term", which will avoid passing on higher costs to consumers that would become embedded in the future cost base of insurance companies. I reiterate that the published Government Bill discussed today, when enacted, will repeal Part VII of the Central Bank Act 1942. Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill amends this part of the 1942 Act. Therefore, this Bill, when enacted, will repeal the provisions Deputy Doherty's Bill proposes to amend and they will no longer be on the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Section 51 of the Government Bill provides for extended time limits for long-term financial services. The Government Bill is also more comprehensive than the Private Members' Bill. Following productive engagement during the development of the Sinn Féin legislation, the Government is willing to make amendments to its Bill to take on board some of the new provisions agreed during the passage of the Private Members' Bill. One such amendment, to be made on Committee Stage, is to increase the time to appeal a decision of the ombudsman to the High Court, from 21 days to 35 days, as proposed in section 8 of Sinn Féin's Private Members' Bill as passed by the Dáil. In addition to this, another Committee Stage amendment will be made to increase the categories of findings the ombudsman can make to ensure they are in line with section 7 of Deputy Doherty's Bill as passed by the Dáil. Following this amendment, these categories will be upheld, substantially upheld, substantially rejected or rejected. This will be a good outcome for the ombudsman process and for consumers. There will also be the publication of decisions, as provided for in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> It will depend on the terms of the financial services as to whether payment protection insurance falls within the definition of long-term financial service. There are many compelling cases of consumers being mistreated by providers or mis-sold products by those entrusted with the legal duty and responsibility to provide quality customer service. It is worth pointing out that under the current regime if a matter arises during an investigation by the Financial Services Ombudsman, which he feels is indicative of a pattern, that is, mis-selling, he will inform the Central Bank so that appropriate regulatory action may be taken. This ability to make recommendations to the regulatory authorities will continue under section 18 of the new legislation. This is also intended to deal with cases that may fall outside the six-year rule, and would allow the Central Bank of Ireland to engage with providers in respect of wider issues. The recent Central Bank investigation and redress given to customers on the mis-selling of payment protection insurance is a case in point.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Deputies may be aware of recent regulatory legislative changes, which will strengthen protection for consumers. In March, the Central Bank of Ireland published its consumer protection risk assessment model, which establishes a new and more intrusive approach for supervisory assessments of regulated firms regarding conduct and consumer protection risk management. This will apply to credit institutions, non-bank lenders, insurance undertakings, investment firms, large retail intermediaries, payment institutions and e-money institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I thank Deputies for their contributions and the support for the Bill they have indicated. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_700">— make transparent to the public the monthly progress from each hospital on waiting list figures, giving specific detail on outpatient waiting lists, access to diagnostic waiting lists and elective surgery lists;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_708">— examine the potential for hospitals without 24/7 emergency departments to increase their elective work;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_709">— direct the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to publish all other waiting list data on a monthly basis as per the criteria used in the waiting lists currently published;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_710">— immediately provide scheduled procedures under the NTPF and maximise the use of private capacity in this regard;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_711">— utilise the existing community hospital network more efficiently to help prevent admissions to acute hospitals by facilitating direct admissions by general practitioners to these facilities, to facilitate post-operative discharges from acute hospitals and to work as an interface between the acute sector and the Fair Deal Scheme; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_712">— commit to upgrades of the community hospitals network to help alleviate pressure in general hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The motion is timely in view of the fact an Oireachtas all-party report was published today on the delivery of health care over the next ten years, changing how it is delivered and the need to fund it accordingly. In adjudicating on the success or failure of the health care system in recent years, it must be said there has been a fundamental failure on every matrix on the part of Government to deliver in a meaningful way in the key areas where there are huge difficulties, which are primarily emergency departments and hospital waiting lists. Some 660,000 people are on hospital waiting lists of one form or another. That is a sad indictment of the failure of the system to deliver in a timely fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> We saw this in a personal way when watching "Living On The List", the RTE Investigates programme broadcast earlier this year. It showed the impact of the delays on people's lives. That is something this side of the House has failed to highlight but, more importantly, it is something the Government has failed to address, by putting mechanisms in place to ensure people are not waiting inordinate periods for inpatient, outpatient or day-case appointments. The reason we tabled this motion is that we still believe the issue is not being responded to in a timely manner by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> People will say the Government was waiting for the publication of the report of the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare. That probably gives a certain amount of cover to people who have no policies in the area of health care. However, and I hate to highlight this consistently, over the past six years Fine Gael has been bereft of any policy direction for the delivery of health care. For the first three years of the previous Government's term we spoke about universal health insurance as the model to be adopted. It was the major policy plank for funding health care in future years. Of course, it was never costed and there was no analysis of how it would be compatible with Ireland's health care system. There was no detail whatsoever in the proposal. We spend three years faffing around on whether it could be implemented. Behind the scenes, it was slowly let wither on the vine. It was eventually put out of its misery in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> Since then there has been no genuine focus on the key areas of the waiting lists and the emergency departments. There are many reasons for the waiting lists, including a lack of capacity, a lack of consultants and a lack of overall coherence in assessing who is on a waiting list and in making people, both clinical and administrative, accountable for waiting lists to ensure there is proper oversight and governance in the delivery of health care. Last year, in the context of the negotiations that took place on the supply and confidence agreement, the issue of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, was raised. A sum of €15 million was to be put aside for it and it was to be included in the 2017 Estimates. Subsequently, there has been no movement in terms of people being treated by the National Treatment Purchase Fund. At the end of May 2017, we have not seen any meaningful processing of people through the system. That is a sad indictment given that, since last June, it has been part of the supply and confidence agreement and of the programme for Government to ensure there are timely interventions for the longest waiters. That has not happened. It is very disturbing. The system should have been able to assess who has been on the waiting list the longest and who should be prioritised for treatment or consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> I ask the Minister to revisit this issue as a matter of urgency and to impress on the National Treatment Purchase Fund the urgency of its deliberations in terms of finding those who will be contracted to provide the services for the longest waiters. There is also a commitment that next year there will be an increase in funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The reason we sought the funding for the NTPF is that the fund has been the mechanism that has been used most effectively as a safety valve, until it was cancelled by the previous Government, due to a lack of capacity in the public health system. I acknowledge that lack of capacity in the public health system. However, it is unacceptable that at the end of May 2017, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has not been taking patients off the waiting list, given that this was included in the supply and confidence agreement this time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> The motion is quite straightforward. It highlights some of the inadequacies in the health system and recognises the conditions being experienced by patients and staff across emergency departments, in particular the treatment of some elderly people which has been well documented. There appears to be a lethargic acceptance within the system that these things are okay. If there are 370 people on trolleys, it is no big deal. No one appears to get excited about it anymore. Some people wait for inordinate periods on trolleys. Until the figure hits 600, there is no interest in whether the system is even delivering safe health care in emergency departments. The matrix now is 600 people. We have allowed our standards and ambition to drop substantially. That was highlighted by the Minister's predecessor who effectively abandoned the waiting list targets that had been set and extended them to 18 months. Instead of trying to address the underlying concerns, the goalposts were moved. It was decided that it was now acceptable for people to spend 18 months on waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> I hope the motion receives cross-party support. It highlights the inadequacies but also calls for some tangible benefits on which I will elaborate later. I commend the motion to the House and I look forward to a good, proactive debate on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">I commend Deputy Kelleher for his work on this issue and his tireless commitment to tackling it. Certainly, I echo his call for a sense of urgency on the part of the Government. This is one of the main issues I deal with each week in my constituency office. I agree with Deputy Kelleher that our standards have lowered. People expect less from the health service today than they did ten years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">That is not the direction in which it should be going; it should be moving in the other direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> The waiting lists continue to grow, as does people's despair because they languish on those lists for such long periods. In my constituency, Mayo, the combined inpatient and outpatient waiting list for Mayo University Hospital showed that over 8,500 people were waiting for procedures at the end of March. Over 1,100 of those have been waiting for more than a year and a half. What those figures represent is a period when we rob people of their health and the ability to go about their lives, do their daily tasks and live free of pain. Many of these individuals, some in tears, have come to my constituency office with family members because they cannot get hip replacements or other joint replacements. Since their condition is not seen as life-threatening, they are left waiting. While it may not be life-threatening, it presents a serious impediment to living a normal, pain-free life. I do not know what it feels like to live in pain for that period but I can only imagine it must be absolute torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> People know that if they can afford private health care, they are likely to be dealt with. It is an awful indictment of a modern republic that there is a two-tier system and that those who cannot afford health care are left to wait. As Deputy Kelleher asked, when will it be too much? When will we be shocked by these figures? Nobody is shocked by the fact that there are 8,500 people on the waiting list at Mayo University Hospital. I am shocked because I have seen the impact on people's lives. I ask the Minister to demonstrate renewed urgency to get the National Treatment Purchase Fund up and running to its full capacity to deal with the waiting lists and ensure that people can resume normal lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">I spent 15 years of my early political career on the North Eastern Health Board trying to ensure both a regional approach and a national approach would be taken to the delivery of hospital health services. While the plan outlined in the Sláintecare report has ambitions and goals to deliver the sort of fair, affordable, effective public health system required, and while it is a cross-party plan, we will need to hear a concrete commitment not only from the current Government but also from its successors to implement this plan. I am reminded of the saying, "To fail to plan is to plan to fail." I hope it is not just a matter of paying lip-service. Rabbie Burns referred to the best-laid plans of mice and men, which, as we know, often go awry. The current state of affairs cannot be permitted to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> In my county, Louth, the most recent waiting list figures make for depressing reading. At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, 1,064 are waiting for inpatient services or surgeries. Over 200 of these have been waiting for more than a year and 18 have been waiting for more than a year and a half. Louth County Hospital has 669 people currently on the waiting list for inpatient services. Regarding outpatients, there are over 13,000 on the waiting list at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital across all specialties and 3,088 at Louth County Hospital. These are disgraceful figures and they are disrespectful to those in need of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Colleagues have referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. I wish to refer to the cross-border health care directive for public patients. I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Harris, previously. I asked that it be advertised. It does not suit everybody because payments must be made upfront, but the directive at least affords patients an opportunity to avail of services not being delivered within the State. The scheme needs to be advertised more proactively in surgeries and clinics across the country. Many people I tell about it say they have not been told about it, either by their consultant or doctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> From my experience, the biggest issue for many is not knowing when to plan for the surgery they hope for. I advocate that some windows and timescales be provided in order to allow people to plan. While those who are in pain need to be seen immediately, those who may be in a position to wait will concentrate and focus on having to wait for the specified period if they get a window.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_728">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion in support of my colleague, Deputy Kelleher. I acknowledge the commitment to and investment in this area. I also welcome today's report on the future of health care. This all raises a problem, and the question to be asked is why we are not seeing the delivery of services to deal with the massive waiting lists affecting people every single day. Considering that the lists are growing day by day in all constituencies, this is a major problem. We must ask why it is not improving. We are saying that the resources are in place, as are the staff, although, perhaps, not at the coalface. The management staff are in place. Is it that management staff in the HSE are not responsible or accountable for delivering the services for the people who need them? Is it that the staff face no consequences if services are not delivered? It is wholly unacceptable that people must wait four years for their cases to be deemed urgent in the context of surgery or some other treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Currently, routine services, treatments and hospital surgeries are not delivered after 4 p.m. on a Friday in most cases and services do not recommence until perhaps 9 a.m. on a Monday morning, or a Tuesday if there is a bank holiday. That is not good enough at all and it is a problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_730"> With regard to adult spinal surgery, I meet the top neurosurgeon from Tallaght regularly. The number on the waiting list in my constituency, Kildare North, which includes Naas hospital, is 525. This is up 32% in a year, all because somebody is not doing what is required regarding the necessary surgery facilities and theatres, made available at a cost of €4 million. Doing so would help solve the problem. The Minister is talking about it. I have spoken about it in this Chamber at length but nothing is happening. We have to get real and deliver services in order to reduce the waiting lists that are affecting so many people negatively in my constituency and throughout the country. Currently, there are between 1,500 and 2,000 on the waiting list in Naas. In Tallaght, the hospital directly affected by this, the number is 7,000. I ask the Minister to take that on board and examine the reasons why we are not delivering.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">We will be economical with the time but the health service is not economical with its budget. The Minister has inherited a long-term issue concerning public health policy, in respect of which no one has got it right. We have one of the biggest public health budgets we have ever seen, with some of the worst outcomes. According to the European Health Consumer Index, we spend four times the amount spent by Greece and Slovakia but we have the same hospital throughput. We have seen the Shortall report and many ideas about spending more money, throwing more hundreds of millions of euro at the problem and offering free GP care, free accident and emergency services and free services for everyone. That just does not work. It is a utopian approach that is not being realistic or honest with people. Thousands of Irish people have been suffering, acquiring disabilities, developing morbidities and dying on our waiting lists. We heard about the scoliosis patients and people having to wait a year and a half for a bypass procedure in the Mater hospital that is crucial to their lives. We know people on the list who have died.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Clearly, we need to invest in a national treatment purchase fund that actually delivers outcomes for patients and by means of which the State can measure its investment. The public health system needs to be examined. <i>The Irish Times</i> carried an excellent article by Cathal O'Sullivan last weekend. It was about trying to be imaginative about specialties within the hospital system. There are generalists and specialists but the former manage the acute load in terms of the accident and emergency departments and the specialists manage the elective procedures and the complex cases. It is important that we do not become experts on spending more. That appears to be the common thread in the solution offered. It should be about doing more with what is currently being spent.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_734">I acknowledge that the Minister is relatively new to his Department and, unlike his predecessor, I am sure he is not chomping at the bit to get out of it. Everyone present will provide endless examples of constituents in urgent need of emergency surgery. Only today, a 64 year old woman from Granard in County Longford who has been waiting months upon months for a critical operation contacted me. She was due to have her procedure today but there was no bed. A lady from Kilbeggan rang me last week. She was due to have her operation in the private system in the first week in June but it has been postponed until the end of August. We have a scheme in place whereby people can get reimbursed if they go to the North for a procedure. That is something people find quite remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> The report of the all-party committee was published today.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">If it is implemented, that is welcome. We have plans and we have the National Treatment Purchase Fund that was set up as part of the confidence and supply arrangement in January of this year. It is not being implemented. It is there but not one penny of it has been spent. Why is that?</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> In the last few seconds of my time, I wish to highlight the serious delays in the processing of medical cards. We have reverted back to a situation in which people are waiting up to two months having completed the medical card application perfectly. We are going back to a situation whereby it is becoming overly restrictive for people with medical needs who need to get a discretionary medical card. The Minister should examine that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> While some people will get on hospital waiting lists, there are others with rare diseases and as a Government and a country, we are failing them. The Minister needs to implement his promise in the programme for Government to ensure that people with rare diseases can get treatment.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_739">I will cut to the chase. Often in these debates, we hear a lot of examples, as Deputy Troy has just highlighted. How about a few solutions? Many times, I have suggested in this House that when it comes to waiting lists, there is the example of the NTPF, which others have used already. It is time the Minister started implementing it and increasing funding to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> Another thing on which I do not see any emphasis in today's report, which is sad, is a relaxation on the means test for the carer's allowance. There is not a family in the country that would not be delighted to care for a loved one, elderly, infirm or otherwise, for the benefit of other home supports such as a medical card and others. It would be much cheaper to encourage people to stay in their own home. That in turn would free up acute beds and beds in nursing homes. It costs €1,000 per day on average throughout the country to stay in a nursing home and €1,000 a day for an acute bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> We also need to resource primary care. What will it cost to put a practice nurse into every practice to carry out mild trauma treatment, suturing, ECGs and so on to again keep people away from the accident and emergency departments?</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> I have to mention child and adolescent mental health services. Throughout the country, they are a shambles at the moment. As of April, appointments had yet to be made to 82 positions. There is no child psychiatrist in Sligo although there are 480 children waiting to see a psychiatrist, of which 87 are urgent cases. We are depending on the goodwill of a retired guy to come back and work 20 hours a week to see the urgent cases. I commend the Enough is Enough campaign in Sligo and throughout the country. Ms Yvonne Rainey, Mr. John Doyle and Ms Michelle Fletcher are spearheading it there and there are many others throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The Minister knows that talk is cheap. It is time for action. I have given a few basic suggestions. I ask him to please at least have them costed.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_744">I want to begin by thanking Deputy Kelleher and his colleagues for tabling this motion and for providing the Dáil with the opportunity to debate the interrelated challenges of waiting times for elective care, emergency care and wider capacity issues in the health system. As with other speakers, I approach this debate conscious that the future of health care committee published its report today. I want to commend the committee members on their contribution to this unprecedented cross-party effort. I am committed to forging political consensus on health wherever possible and I can confirm that in that spirit the Government will not be opposing this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> It is also important that we debate this motion in context. We are debating this motion after a lost decade of economic investment in our public services. I also agree with Deputy Jack Chambers in that the debate about health care does need to be about more than just euro and cents. It needs to be about structures, outcomes and accountability. I will touch on some of that in a moment. All Members in this House share the same desire to place patients and their needs at the centre of debate. It is up to the political system - all of us collectively - to find ways to reach sustainable solutions within the available resources. On that note, I must point out there are some issues in this motion that have significant cost implications and I will return to these later. First, I want to talk about the long waiting times facing too many of our patients, the burden this places on patients and their families and the efforts I am making to address this. The considerable rise in these numbers has been due to many reasons, not least our past economic situation and consequent reduction in investment in health. On the other hand, we have seen a consistent rise in demand for health services due to our growing and ageing population. I have been working with the HSE, the NTPF and my own officials to put initiatives in place to address these long waiting times that so traumatically affect people’s quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> In recent months, the HSE has developed a number of waiting list action plans. These plans are now finalised and I sincerely welcome them. I am also pleased to announce that their implementation has already commenced and I have been advised they are on target. Today, we have published a specific action plan for scoliosis, which will aim to ensure that no child will be waiting more than four months for spinal fusion and other spinal procedures by the end of 2017. To date, around 100 spinal surgeries have taken place in Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Temple Street Children’s University Hospital and Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital. Outsourcing to hospitals nationally and abroad is currently under way. In April, a new orthopaedic theatre opened in Crumlin ensuring that spinal surgeries in the hospital are being conducted with leading-edge technology in the most up-to-date environment. With ongoing nurse recruitment, it is expected that theatre capacity will increase by an additional two days a week with effect from July. I believe all of us were disgusted with the situation facing children and adolescents with scoliosis. I thank the advocacy groups for their input into this plan published today. It will ensure that no child or adolescent will wait longer than four months for a scoliosis procedure by the end of this year. That brings this country in line with the NHS.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The inpatient day-case and outpatient waiting list action plans focus on reducing the number of patients who will be waiting 15 months or more for inpatient day-case treatment or outpatient appointments by the end of October of this year. The inpatient day-case action plan aims to remove over 29,000 patients by the end of October through a combination of normal hospital activity funded under the HSE's national service plan, as well as both insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising €15 million of NTPF funding. The list has already been reduced by over 12,000 patients under this plan. I am sure Deputy Louise O'Reilly will welcome the fact that some of that will be insourced and it will not all be outsourced to the private sector. The outpatient plan will seek to remove over 95,000 patients by the end of October and over 36,000 patients have had their outpatient appointments under this plan to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> In addition to the HSE's waiting list action plans, last December I granted approval to the NTPF for the first tranche of funding in the region of €5 million for an initiative focused on those waiting longest for day-case treatment with a view to ensuring that in excess of 2,000 patients waiting more than 18 months for a day-case procedure will have received an appointment for their procedure by the end of next month. The NTPF has advised that currently, more than 300 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital. While it took some time to ramp up the NTPF in terms of its own procurement processes, patients are today receiving appointments through that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Consequently, through these action plans and the €15 million of NTPF funding for patient treatment allocated in the last budget, I am determined that as much progress as possible will be made to reduce the numbers of those patients waiting the longest for treatment. I will be meeting the HSE and NTPF on a regular basis throughout 2017 to ensure that the maximum number of long-waiting patients receive treatment under these action plans and that best value is achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I have also instructed my officials to commence planning for 2018 immediately in light of the increased allocation for next year. As part of this process, priority will again be given to the longest waiters, where possible, and the aim will be to build a long-term sustainable solution towards long waiting times in particular areas and specialties based on the robust analysis of the demand and capacity within the system to deliver services appropriately. We need to be planning for next year already now that we know that the NTPF is back up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> I also wish to address briefly the point made in the motion regarding the waiting list initiative of 2015. That year, additional funding of €51 million was allocated to the HSE to maximise capacity across public hospitals or to outsource activity. At the end of 2015, the HSE reported 95% achievement for the inpatient day-case waiting list and 93% achievement for the outpatient waiting list against the 15-month maximum wait times. In fairness to my predecessor, it is important to put that on the record of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> It is important to note that as of last April, less than 7% of patients on the impatient day-case waiting list and less than 10% of patients on the outpatient waiting list were waiting 18 months or more for their procedure or appointment, though that is still far too many. Nevertheless, I fully accept that significant improvements are needed in this area to ensure that patients are seen and receive treatment in a much more timely fashion. Therefore, I wish to emphasise that the work due to take place this year is only the first step towards a more sustainable and sustained reduction in waiting times for patients. The NTPF allocation for 2018 will rise to €50 million and planning for next year has already commenced, as I have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I will now move on to discuss the issues raised on emergency department, ED, overcrowding, again referenced in the motion, and the development of initiatives in this regard. Our health service continues to see an unacceptable level of overcrowding in emergency departments and I acknowledge the distress this causes to patients, their families and those front-line staff working in extremely difficult conditions in hospitals throughout the country. I have stated repeatedly that the answer to this problem has to lie in increased capacity, that is, more beds, more staff and more capacity in primary care.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> However, there has been progress in 2017. If we do not acknowledge the progress, we cannot build on it and try to tackle the issues. Already, data indicate there has been a 2.9% reduction in patients waiting on a trolley nationally at the end of April 2017. Statistics and percentages can be lost on all of us, but this equates to more than 1,269 fewer patients waiting on trolleys this year compared with the first quarter of 2016. It is still too many, but more than 1,200 fewer patients are on trolleys this year than at the same period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">We have discussed the winter initiative many times here so I will not repeat the elements of it again tonight except to say one of its more general benefits was to enable improved responsiveness by the HSE and the Department in responding to periods of significant emergency department demand. Emergency department performance this winter illustrated that many model 4 hospitals showed the ability to maintain or improve emergency department performance this year and, in particular, bounce hack effectively after periods of surge in emergency department demand. Moving forward, we need to put in place measures to support capacity and process improvement in some of our smaller model 3 hospitals and those hospitals in the west and south which experienced challenges during the winter. The development of co-ordinated winter plans between hospital groups and CHOs continued to facilitate and support improved responses to winter pressures across primary, acute and social care for the benefit of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Since the conclusion of the winter initiative at the end of March, my Department and the HSE have both engaged in a "lessons learned" process involving looking back at what worked this year - some things did improve, particularly relating to a reduction in delayed discharges - and what did not work. Many things did not work and need improvement. The winter initiative also recognised the interrelated interdependent nature of the environment within which public hospitals operate and, as such, was cognisant of the need to increase capacity within our health services. Under the winter initiative, 90 additional hospital beds were opened in Mercy University Hospital Cork, University Hospital Galway, the Mater, Beaumont and Mullingar. This work continues and I was delighted just this week to welcome the opening of the new emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, an emergency department that is three times the size of the previous one. I look forward to visiting it next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Notwithstanding these improvements, I have repeatedly made clear that increasing capacity within our health service is a priority. My Department commenced a capacity review earlier this year in line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government. Unlike previous years, it will look at the range of capacity, not just capacity in the acute hospital sector. Work is progressing, the steering group has met twice, external contractors will commence work in early June and I look forward to its findings later in the year. </p>
          <p eId="para_758"> As I mentioned at the start, there are some proposals in this motion that have significant cost implications for the Exchequer and are not currently funded under the national service plan 2017 or the budget passed by this House. However, I will consider these proposals and any constructive suggestions in the context of budget 2018 and winter planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> Before I conclude, I would like to add that in order to achieve significant improvements in patients' experiences and improve capacity in the public health service, broader reforms are needed. I think this is something with which we would all agree. For example, we need to further develop the strategic synergies of hospital groups and ensure that the role of smaller hospitals is strengthened in appropriate areas of service delivery. We also need to properly develop and embed primary care as the bedrock of our health system. The Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare has made a series of recommendations regarding overall capacity in our health system, including specific measures to tackle emergency department waiting times and overcrowding and waiting times for diagnostics, outpatient appointments and elective procedures. I look forward to considering the report and its recommendations in full in the coming days. It is my intention to have an initial discussion at the next Cabinet meeting in advance of a full Dáil debate on the report in June.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">The Minister referred to issues of capacity and referenced the new accident and emergency unit in Limerick, which was long overdue. Indeed I stood on a picket line with the nurses there when Fianna Fáil was in government. We were striking for more staff. The then Government did not give them to us. We warned at the time about the capacity issues that were coming down the line. The then Government did not listen to us. You guys came along and did not listen to us either. Lo and behold, the accident and emergency unit opens and there are over 30 people on trolleys. The reason they are on trolleys is because we have a capacity deficit in the health service. We will not address the issue of capacity within the public health service by putting money into the private sector. This is why Sinn Féin is proposing an amendment and why we are not in a position to support the Fianna Fáil motion because writ large in it is privatisation via the NTPF. </p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The Minister is carrying out a survey of people in our health system, which is to be welcomed. That is like winning the lottery. As one woman told me, it is very tough to get into the health service but when you get in there, the care you get is second to none. I salute the doctors, nurses, theatre porters and the people who clean our hospitals because they are working in intolerable conditions and indeed are leaving in large numbers for that reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> The survey looks only at those who have been lucky to get in the door. We leave it to "Prime Time Investigates" to survey those who cannot get in the door. We have seen the results of that on a number of occasions and have all agreed that this is unacceptable yet we still come back to the position whereby the Government of the day and its best friends supporting it still think that somehow we will be able to improve the public service by putting money into the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> There is a reason there is capacity within the private sector. It is because well-trained and highly-educated staff are leaving our health service along with students graduating from our universities and going into the private sector. They are being attracted by bonuses. Of course, they are doing so because we are here this evening discussing a revenue stream that will go directly into the private sector from the public purse. The Minister knows this because I have said on countless occasions that we will never sort out a problem of capacity in the public service by putting money into the private sector. A total of 660,000 people are on hospital waiting lists. We can and did agree that this is not acceptable. We had cross-party agreement. The Committee on the Future of Healthcare reached consensus on a large number of issues, chief among which is the need to only spend public money in the public good. I put it to the Minister that the only way to ensure this money is well spent is to ensure that it is spent resourcing public services. </p>
          <p eId="para_815"> We must also remember that when we discuss issues of capacity, the moratorium on recruitment in the health service was brought in two years ahead of the one introduced in the rest of the Civil Service and public service. I know this because I had a trip to the Labour Court as a direct result. Fianna Fáil was in government then. The bright idea of the NTPF did not work. It had no long-term impact. It might make a nice soundbite to say we can send someone to a private hospital or to England or France to have an operation but, in truth, it is not true to say that people do not care where their operation is done and that they are happy to go along. People want a decent, well-resourced and fully staffed public health service and they will not get it if we keep putting hard-earned money into the private sector. It is counter-intuitive to suggest that putting money into the private sector will somehow magically improve the public service. It will not. Therefore, we are proposing an amendment to the Fianna Fáil motion. Our amendment focuses on capacity but it also focuses on Comhliosta. The Minister will be aware of this. Sinn Féin has put forward a proposal and I know the Minister is examining this at the moment. We would like to see this extended to the whole island. We believe that what has happened in Portugal in terms of a single integrated waiting list management system is a really important step towards us being able to manage waiting lists. We will not be able to improve services in the public health service unless we invest in the public health service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_816">There are 660,000 people on HSE waiting lists. This is the equivalent to the populations of Leitrim, Longford, Carlow, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Cavan, Offaly, Laois and Westmeath. These ten counties represent about one third of the State. Every access point to the health service is being closed off by this Government. The last point of access for many people - accident and emergency departments - are hammered.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> Last year, in the Louth-Meath area, about 9,000 people were on those waiting lists. These people are not counted among the 660,000 on the waiting lists. What do these people have in common? First, they are the most vulnerable people in society. They are the people who are most ill. The majority of them are in serious pain or discomfort. Many of them have had to stop working and are in forced economic dependence on the State. Many have lost their independence and have had to go into care or be cared for by their family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The second thing they have in common is that they are from low and middle-income backgrounds. They are the collateral damage of Fine Gael's economic policies and the symptom of the model of government Fine Gael has chosen. They are 660,000 of the sickest and poorest people in the State whose lives have been suspended for months if not years of pain. In my county, roughly 25,000 people are on waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">In Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, outpatient waiting lists in February 2017 comprised approximately 5,276 patients. This is a massive figure, but it is not the whole figure, because many Meath people are on waiting lists elsewhere. The number of people in Our Lady's Hospital waiting for longer than 12 months was 582. The number of those waiting longer than 15 months was 321. This is despite a programme for Government promise in 2011 which said that no patient would have to wait longer than 12 months for a hospital appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> It has not happened by accident. Take my own hospital in Navan, for example. It was Fine Gael's policy in recent years that the endoscopy theatre would be closed every Friday. It has been Fine Gael policy that the general surgery theatre was closed every Monday. It has been official Fine Gael policy to have significant caps on the orthopaedic operations in our hospital. Some doctors have told me that, over the winter period, in the five months of last winter, they were only allowed to carry out operations for five days. There are the overheads, capacity and much of the resources, but there are still blocks with regard to delivering services.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> What does this mean for real people? Yesterday, an elderly gentleman came into my office in Trim. He had two cataracts. He is left practically blind at the moment. He lives on his own. That is shortly going to be "he lived on his own". An elderly man who is practically blind, or very badly sighted at the moment, is not going to be able to function independently. He has told me that his operation is over a year away at the moment. What could I say to this proud and independent man yesterday except that I would do my best and ring the doctor to see what happened? I am sure the doctors in the hospital took dozens of calls that day from similar individuals. A woman in her 50s in Westmeath contacted me. She was diagnosed with chronic pain in her back. She has numbness and swelling in her legs and she has a constant urge to urinate. She was put on the waiting list for surgery in June 2016 and doctors have told her to try to go private. She just does not have the money to do that. Then doctors told her to present herself at an accident and emergency department and that there was a good chance she might get some level of emergency surgery in that space. Her operation has been put back repeatedly, and she is now in excruciating pain for 365 days and nights. I know a number of kids who have come into my offices who are trying to do exams while seriously ill and on waiting lists as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> The problem with this is that it is a false economy. On an individual basis, if diagnosis is delayed, the treatment to an individual is delayed and that person's health crisis is going to deteriorate. He or she will need more crisis interventions in the long run. These crisis interventions will cost much money and will clog our acute services. Replicate this over the whole population and there is a Fine Gael health service in crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. Unfortunately, it feels like Groundhog Day. Yet again hospital waiting lists have hit an all-time high. Yet again we are back in this Chamber discussing the inability of Government to tackle the crisis. It seems we are doomed to repeat this until someone gets his or her finger out, shows a bit of backbone and finally makes the call to implement serious and radical changes in our health system. One would think that someone would have copped on that tinkering around the edges clearly is not working. At the start of May, 666,000 people were on hospital waiting lists. Let that number, 666,000 people, sink in for a moment. That is 58,000 more people on waiting lists since the formation of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> These are not just statistics. Behind these figures are real people. It could be someone's child, mother or grandparents. I had many people on to my office speaking about how they were preparing for a serious operation only to get a phone call a few hours beforehand to be told it was cancelled or postponed. This is not good enough. The Government gave a commitment in January 2015 that no citizen would be waiting longer than 15 months for treatment. That commitment clearly has not been met. In my local hospital, Beaumont, more than 26,000 people are waiting for outpatient appointments this month. That includes 3,100 people waiting for 18 months or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> It appears that the Government has no real plans to tackle this issue while the public is sick and tired of listening to the constant reassurance that the Government is working on it and while waiting lists grow and pressure continues to pile on front-line workers. We need real investment in health. We need more doctors and more nurses. We need a real public health care system and an end to the failure of this two-tier policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">Táim buíoch as ucht deis labhairt ar an ábhar fíor-thábhachtach seo anocht. As we know, our health service is in continuous crisis, with more than 660,000 people on hospital waiting lists throughout the State. Despite all the spin by the Government, the modest targets for the reduction in waiting times have not been met and that is the fact of the matter. Even if they had been met, they would still be the worst in Europe. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have presided over chaos in our health system. It is ordinary citizens, along with the overworked and exhausted staff in our hospitals, who are doing their very best in spite of the circumstances. They have paid and are paying the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> In my constituency of Offaly, the emergency protocol was activated 230 times in the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore in 2016. This was the third highest in the State. There has been an ongoing overcrowding problem in the emergency department of the hospital, and this has led to many last-minute cancellations of elective surgery, with many elderly people being affected. Chronic under-resourcing of our health system has led us to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> This motion by Fianna Fáil is all style and little substance, but that is no surprise. It lists the problems but does not identify the solutions. Fianna Fáil introduced a recruitment moratorium in the health sector in 2007, two years before the rest of the public service. The proposals to schedule surgeries and diagnostic investigations at the weekend are nothing short of populist drivel and the point has been completely missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Our health service needs resources. Shuffling staff about is the equivalent of arranging the deckchairs on a sinking <i>Titanic</i>. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have presided over the loss of 4,448 nurses between 2007 and 2017. The previous Government cut health funding by 20% and the number of health care staff by 12%. Now the people involved stand here and scratch their heads and wonder how they can fix the problem. All the while, hundreds of thousands of patients are waiting in pain for treatment. Resources, investment, action and political will are required. The solutions are simple, and there has to be true commitment to develop a quality health system that treats people based on need rather than ability. That is the way forward and the way we need to take. I fear that commitment is missing from the parties on both sides of this House and all the motions in the world will not fix that problem.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_830">I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry. I support some of the observations and aspirations in this motion but, sadly, it is largely aspirational unless we have a fundamental policy change for health care in this country. As Deputy Nolan says, there is a human story behind every statistic in this motion. Some 660,000 people are on waiting lists. That is 660,000 individuals. The 100,000 outpatients are 100,000 individuals. We are sanitised to those human stories both inside and outside this Chamber. We can wax lyrical on what is going on with the health service, but there needs to be health service revolution, from the bottom to the top, and that has to be driven by front-line staff rather than HSE middle managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Today we are talking about the long waiting times for people. There was a report on this in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week, which I mentioned to the Taoiseach. It is extraordinary that 2,000 children are waiting for initial mental health appointments and Barnardos has said this is causing unnecessary consequences for those children.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> One can include what is happening in Lynn Dara. Eleven beds have been closed in Lynn Dara for one reason only, because of the shortage of nursing staff. Nurses are leaving the health service. As I said to the Taoiseach last week, there is almost a two-tier pay system in the medical profession because health care workers in the public sector are being enticed by the private sector. The reason Linn Dara is closing down for three months with the loss of 11 beds is the shortage of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Nursing staff are looking at the public sector pay talks with an eye to their future. Numerous beds and theatres have closed down across the country. Health care workers are looking at the public health system and they see a sick system. I worked in the health care system for a long time. The majority of the time one has a very good experience in the public health care system, but when it comes to waiting times and waiting for beds, it is a sick system.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> The other statistic that stands out is that since 2008 and the crisis in this country, 3,500 nurses have been taken out of the public health system. That is a 9% reduction in nursing staff. Of course, one will have a perennial crisis. Also, the mental health care staff is 21% lower than recommended. Of course, one will have a crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> My question to the Minister is simple. Does he believe in a universal health system? I do not know whether he does.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">On numerous occasions I have had this argument about the health service being ideologically run because of the two-tier system.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Fianna Fáil's motion is hypocritical. In 2001, 2002 and 2003, the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, was giving subsidies to builders to build a lot of private hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> We will continue to have this perennial problem. I am sure the Minister does not want this to be happening. We will have this crisis constantly unless we deal with the fundamental issue of the health service. The fundamental reason there is a crisis in the health service is that it is a two-tier health service. The privatisation of some public hospitals and the public system is causing the crisis. Sometimes it is not about money. Sometimes it is about staff and people. People make it a good health service. It is a good health service when one accesses it but waiting times for beds are not acceptable. When there is a system of universal health care, regardless of how much one has in one's pocket, we will have a system about which everybody will feel confident and proud. Until then, we will have crisis upon crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">Deputy Gino Kenny is entirely correct. We have a two-tier health service and the National Treatment Purchase Fund should be shut down. All the moneys that are set aside for it should be invested instead in the public health service. Between 2002 and 2013, there was €676 million transferred to the private sector through the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This year and next year, a further €70 million will be transferred. We would have a much-improved public health service if that funding had been invested in the public health services rather than transferred out of them through this fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> The National Treatment Purchase Fund will be of little or no use for complex less lucrative treatments because of the cherry-picking of the private hospitals. They like the simpler operations. They like the more profitable operations, such as cataracts, varicose veins, and hip and knee replacements. The complex, less lucrative treatments are in significant measure left to the public system. It is yet another example of the private sector piggybacking on the public health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Dr. Peter Boylan told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_843"> The NTPF is a bad idea. That money should be invested in the health services immediately. What happens is that somebody who is on a waiting list for years is sent to a doctor they have never seen before for a pre-planned procedure that might not be appropriate. They get the procedure and never see the person again. It is grossly unsatisfactory. It is just bad clinical practice and it should be abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The motion talks about reopening closed beds. A major reason there are so many closed beds on closed wards in the hospitals is a lack of staff. The crisis the HSE has with recruitment and retention of nurses, midwives and other grades is not entirely about pay rates, but pay rates are an important part of this. The pay cuts that have been suffered by the public health nurses and other staff must be reversed. There should be cost-of-living increases which take full account of increases in the price of accommodation and they should be paid not a penny less than their counterparts in the private health care system. That would mean the private system could no longer poach from the public system staff who have been publicly trained and publicly educated.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> The motion talks about transparency on hospital waiting lists. We support the publication of the hidden lists. We support one national waiting list bringing together both the public and the private. We are opposed to allowing private patients skip the queues. We want an end to the setting of targets for private income public hospitals to offset austerity cuts, and instead the cuts to be reversed. Finally, we want the section 38s, the voluntary hospitals etc., taken into full public ownership. The independent management structures are a recipe for a lack of transparency. If one wants a transparent health service, one needs a fully public health service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_846">I am sharing time with Deputies Pringle and Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> I am delighted to have the brief opportunity to speak on this health motion which, ironically, is being brought to us by the Fianna Fáil Party which played a large role in the almost annihilation of many aspects of the health system since 2008. When one looks at the basic information on the motion, that more than 660,000 people around the country are on a hospital waiting list, more than 100,000 outpatients are waiting for more than a year for an appointment and more than 46,000 outpatients are on a waiting list for more than 18 months according to figures from April 2017, most citizens will conclude that the health service is just not fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> Of course, it is extraordinary that the present leader of Fianna Fáil is a former Health Minister. The Ceann Comhairle will remember the days when the Deputy was under considerable pressure in this House and facing votes of no confidence. It is also amazing that a putative leader of Fine Gael this week passed through that Department without hardly making a mark - I cannot remember a single important announcement - and apparently, according to a former Minister, Ms Nora Owen, fled out of the Department before he was asked to take any major decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> On 6 February last, we were shocked, appalled and disgusted by the "RTE Investigates: Living on the List" programme which showed the reality of a life of pain for tens of thousands of people awaiting procedures in our hospitals. The programme also highlighted the disingenuous way in which waiting lists are being administered and reported through the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The NTPF excluded data from the pre-admit lists in its monthly reports, a figure that stood then at 22,927 patients nationwide waiting up to 18 months for surgical procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">There were almost 59,000 patients on the pre-planned list, including patients who needed treatments such as hip replacements and children who needed scoliosis surgery. Like all other Deputies, I am often contacted at my weekly information clinics by people who are at their wits' end waiting on these appalling lists for treatment. What has been particularly frustrating recently is the number of older constituents with cataracts who are waiting for more than a year and whose eyesight is deteriorating rapidly, as well as those who are waiting on hip replacements.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Since June 2016 I have been awaiting a reply from the Minister about the status of the new accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital. The previous austerity Government highlighted the new accident and emergency project but did nothing to bring it to fruition and the current Government is also dragging its feet on it. I am also awaiting replies on the National Treatment Purchase Fund pre-admit and pre-planned procedure lists and the number of patients awaiting knee and hip operations at Beaumont Hospital. I have written to the Minister's office directly requesting replies to my parliamentary questions and I would ask him to expedite that. </p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Finally, I wish to welcome the publication today of the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, led by Deputy Róisín Shortall, which offers great hope for the future. I also welcome the fact that the Minister seems to have broadly welcomed it and hopefully the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight will discuss it further. </p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_853">I also welcome the report from the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare. Unfortunately, however, it will sit for a long time on the shelf before anybody dusts it off and looks at it again. I have no faith that either of the two larger parties in this House will actually implement its recommendations because it goes against their ethos for the development of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The fact that 660,000 people are on hospital waiting lists and a further 100,000 are waiting for outpatient clinic appointments is a sad indictment of the treatment of the health service for more than 30 years by this House. The health services had not recovered from the cuts imposed in the 1980s by the time the cuts of 2008 were imposed and they have not recovered to this day. Deputy Broughan mentioned people waiting for cataract operations. A constituent of mine had to have cataracts removed but was told that he would have to wait for more than a year to have the procedure done in Sligo General Hospital. He asked his consultant what the situation would be if he opted to have it done privately and was told that it could be done within two weeks. He paid €800 and two weeks later he went into the public hospital in Sligo to have his cataract removed. He had his second eye done a few weeks later. If he had stayed in the public system, he would probably be blind before being treated. That is the kind of health service this and previous Governments have developed and pushed on. We now have a situation where the managers of hospitals in my constituency are suggesting to patients who are looking for appointments that they should make an application under the treatment abroad scheme to be treated in Northern Ireland. It is difficult for managers in our health service to make such a suggestion but that is what they have been reduced to. I know of one patient who was told he would have to wait for four years for a lung capacity test in his local hospital. I know of patients who have been triaged for an "urgent" orthopaedic appointment who have been told that the waiting list is two years long. That situation is replicated right across the country. </p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Fianna Fáil's only solution is to ramp up the NTPF and to pump more money into the private sector. That will not deal with the issue but will just put a lot of money into the pockets of private consultants and the coffers of private hospitals and ultimately, that is the goal. What we need to see is an opening up of the operating theatres in our public hospitals and the provision of adequate staff. Our public hospitals can tackle our public waiting lists if they are properly funded to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_856">I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate. While I do not entirely agree with the motion before us, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue. As someone who sat on the health forum in Galway city for ten years, these figures are not new to me. The appalling fact is that we still have these figures, notwithstanding commitments from government after government. The only light is the report that was published today which will, hopefully, begin to make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> The NTPF, which was to be a temporary measure, was absolutely abused by successive governments, particularly those led by Fianna Fáil. The fund was portrayed as a solution to the problem. We also had the special delivery unit and the co-location initiative from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. All of our efforts, as local councillors, went into telling the then Government that this was not the right way to deal with the problem and that there were other solutions. Each time we stand up in here we are accused by other Deputies of being negative. I resent that greatly because we have stood up and repeatedly offered solutions to these problems. In Galway city the Department has been asked repeatedly to listen to what management is seeking, which is to be allowed to go ahead with an options appraisal for a new hospital. We are still waiting for a new accident and emergency department, a project which has not progressed at all. I must pay tribute to a local newspaper, the <i>Galway City Tribune</i>, and urge the Minister to take a trip to Galway and visit the psychiatric unit there. The Mental Health Commission has produced a damning report on the unit year after year. The only answer from the hospital is that eventually there will be a new premises. However, the date for that new premises keeps being pushed out. In the meantime, the psychiatric unit is not fit for purpose. Week after week, as highlighted in the aforementioned local newspaper, the unit has refused suicidal patient after suicidal patient. One such patient was told to take part in the Darkness into Light event. That was the advice given to her as she was turned away. Another person subsequently took his life. I am not going down the road of sharing anecdotes, however. This is a reflection of a dysfunctional system which is a direct result of the actions of various governments to privatise health care, by way of the NTPF, the special delivery unit and so on. The Taoiseach appeared in Galway and said that the accident and emergency department was not fit for purpose. His next trip to the county was to take part in a photo shoot for the opening of an extension to the private hospital. I am quite clear where the Government stands. If there has been a conversion on the road to Damascus as a result of the report of the Oireachtas Committee chaired by Deputy Róisín Shortall, then I pay tribute to her for bringing that about. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelHarty" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Deputy Michael Harty<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_858">I would like to address the issue of the waiting lists under the following five headings: recruitment and retention of staff; the lack of bed capacity; access to diagnostics; health service practices and management; and primary and community care manpower. Deputies Kelleher, Louise O'Reilly and I, along with 11 other members sat on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare for 11 months to try to solve this problem. I must say that I am very disappointed that the Minister has just left the Chamber, given that I have been trying to speak to him for over a month on these issues but have not managed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> The recruitment and retention of staff is a huge issue. I speak here about consultants, general practitioners, nurses and therapists. The Irish health system is not an attractive place in which to work. The main problems are working conditions, career progression and job satisfaction. We train the best graduates in the world, allow them to leave the country and then we trawl the world trying to replace them. That makes absolutely no sense. </p>
          <p eId="para_860"> In terms of bed capacity, anyone who believes there are enough beds in our system should not be allowed anywhere near health planning. We need ICU, coronary care, acute, step-down and long-term beds. The bed capacity review is sporadic but should be continuous. If we have between 200 and 600 patients on trolleys and 400 to 800 delayed discharges, then it is quite obvious we have a bed capacity issue. There is a huge amount of unmet need.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> In terms of access to diagnostics, there are difficulties with ultrasound, CT scanning, endoscopy, cardiology and echocardiography. Limiting access to diagnostics leads to unnecessary referrals to secondary care, which clogs up the system in our outpatient and accident and emergency departments. Nowhere is our two-tier system more vividly seen than in access to diagnostics. Rationing access to diagnostics is a false economy and such access is essential if we are to deliver proper health care. </p>
          <p eId="para_862"> We need to look at the management structures in the health service. We need improved governance and increased accountability. The report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is very strong on introducing legislation to make sure we have proper governance, accountability and answerability.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The report that was published earlier today proposes a move from a hospital-centred service to a service that is centred on primary care, including general practice. We cannot do that unless we have enough GPs. If the GP contract is not renegotiated as a matter of urgency, the vision set out in the Committee on the Future of Healthcare's report will not be sustainable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_864">We have five Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility for health, and we have any amount of HSE managers, but we do not have a proper health service that treats everyone the same. People who are in pain and in need of procedures are not treated equally. Last Thursday evening - in the middle of the summer - there were 18 people on trolleys at Kerry General Hospital. As I have highlighted on many occasions, people have gone practically blind because they have been waiting two or three years to get cataract procedures. That is not fair or right in any democratic society. We have been told that this can be done much more quickly - in six to 12 weeks - under the Sligo model. Teenagers are having to wait four to five years to get orthodontic treatment. If they are 17, 18 or 19 by the time they get such treatment, their gums have gone too hard. The procedure does not work out and is not a success. On several occasions last year and earlier this year, people waiting for heart bypass surgery at Cork University Hospital were sent home and had to wait for up to five weeks. That is not right. People are waiting for a year, a year and a half or maybe two years for hip replacements.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I would like to mention another anomaly that has been highlighted recently. Many people do not apply for a medical card until they get sick or have to go into hospital. They make an application when a problem arises and wait for four or five weeks for the card to be sanctioned. They have to pay the hospital bills that mount up in the meantime even though they qualify for a medical card. I suggest that in the case of someone who qualifies for a medical card, the card should be effective from the date of application.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> Not enough money is being spent on front-line staff. That needs to be addressed. A new building at the Deer Lodge mental health unit in Killarney was built two years ago to cater for 40 patients, but it has yet to be opened. What is happening? I have been told that during Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba, a person who presented with a hip or heart problem could get an operation that week. All the world was giving out about the Castro dictatorship, but it had a better health service than the one we have here.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> I thank Deputy Kelleher for giving me this opportunity to raise these matters. The Government needs to get working because the current approach is a failure. Sick people need to be treated urgently.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_868">Maybe we need to get a dictator over here because there are 660,000 people on waiting lists and 100,000 of them have been on those lists for over a year. We have failed utterly. I am disappointed that the Minister could not stay. I know he is busy. He is canvassing ar an mbóthar. It is nearly all over now. It should be in the bag one way or another at this stage. The Minister is gone. Tá sé imithe. I suppose he will be gone out of his current job next week if the right horse does not get over the fence. He will be like the incumbent Taoiseach, St. Leo, whose mantra with regard to the HSE was "It was like that when I got here". Someone mentioned that he did nothing in the HSE. He just coasted through it. The HSE is out of control. It has no accountability. It is not meaningful to the people. It does not deal with people. It has lost its way completely. It is a dysfunctional organisation. The Minister and the four Ministers of State are all pulling at different bits of it, but they cannot do anything with it. That was evident again this evening when I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the cases of people with disabilities who are waiting to be seen by occupational therapists and specialists. This is criminal. If anyone working privately treated people like this, he or she would be charged with manslaughter.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> The hospitals are not clean. They are not being run properly. There is not enough space in them. South Tipperary General Hospital has been operating on a full capacity protocol for 17 months. HSE managers probably spent weeks in rooms coming up with this terminology. They probably had conferences, video-conferences, tele-conferences and mobile conferences in their cars to develop this protocol. I hear people who pull over in their cars and are still in conferences, but nothing is going on. They have protocols for this and protocols for that. They have meetings to decide to have investigations. They commission report upon report upon report, but they cannot have clean hospitals. I suggest we should bring the matrons back to run the hospitals. That would be better than having a plethora of bed managers, ward managers, floor managers, hygiene managers, linen managers and food managers. They have gobbled up and cannibalised a system of decent people. Nurses, doctors and other front-line staff have been hunted. We cannot keep them. The HSE is out of control. It is drifting from crisis to crisis. I do not know who is going to cry "Halt" or say "Stop". It is just not fair to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> Today - at the height of summer - there are 29 people in South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel. We used to call it St. Joseph's Hospital, but that name was banished. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on organising plebiscites in hospitals across the country and bringing artists in to try to get different names to banish the names of the saints. People were afraid that those names might damage them. The hospitals were clean when they were run efficiently by the nuns. Nobody got MRSA. We never heard of it ten years ago. People are now going home to die after picking up this awful illness in our hospital system.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> It is time for the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to wrestle with her conscience, if she can find it, and to try to do something. The same thing applies to the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and Corcoran Kennedy, and to the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is still in the Department of Health for the time being. I cannot even think of the name of the other Minister of State in the Department. There are five of them. It is like musical chairs. Like the officials, they are passing the buck, passing the package or passing the paper. To hell with the public service people. They are supposed to be serving the patients, but they are not doing so. They are self-serving people. They are interested in promotions and careers. They set up consultancies when they retire on big packages.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I will try to match the eloquence that has just been displayed. It is positive that the debate on the Fianna Fáil motion on our health service has focused on solutions rather than on reciting all the problems to the Minister and the Ministers of State, who are acutely aware of the issues that exist. I welcome the Minister's decision to accept the motion crafted by Deputy Kelleher, which seeks a path forward to help people. The Minister's acceptance of the motion must mean much more than platitudes in terms of the reality on the ground for hospitals throughout Ireland. At the end of April, the number of people waiting for inpatient treatment at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan was 434 and the number of people waiting for outpatient treatment was 657. These figures represent an increase of 110%. Tonight's statements will not mean anything unless things change on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> One of the key solutions we are calling for in our motion is the use of outpatient clinic space. We want all ward beds that have been closed to be opened without delay. In the case of my own hospital, there are empty wards where the 24-7 psychiatric ward used to be located before it was moved to a facility in Drogheda. Unbelievably, this move was welcomed last week by the president of Sinn Féin, Deputy Adams, who said it was great to see the ward being transferred to Drogheda. Members of Sinn Féin, like Deputies Adams and Tóibín, might welcome the closure of the units in Navan, but the members of the Save Navan Hospital group and I certainly do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> The backdrop to the waiting figures at the hospital is even more galling. In the week of the 2011 general election, it was infamously promised in <i>The Meath Chronicle</i> that a new regional hospital for the north east would be located in Navan as long as the people of Meath voted for Fine Gael candidates. This was splashed across the front page of that edition of the newspaper, which I have kept for the last six years. The public voted for Fine Gael and sent the Ministers of State, Deputies English, Regina Doherty and McEntee, as well as the current Senator Butler, to this House, but the hospital they promised would be built and opened has vanished like Brigadoon. The field in which it was supposed to be built has nothing in it but cattle. Calves, rather than little royal county babies, are being delivered in it. The very least we deserve is for Our Lady's Hospital in Navan to be invested in. The extensive campus at the hospital needs to be upgraded and supported so that the 200,000 residents of County Meath can receive quality health care.</p>

          <p eId="para_883">How am I going to follow that? I compliment Deputy Kelleher on tabling this motion. There was a "Prime Time Investigates" programme on hospital waiting lists on the second Monday night of January of this year, and for the following two or three days the nation had almost come to a halt over the crisis gripping our health service. Then it faded from the media because there were more sexy comments or programmes and talk of the collapse of the Government, which took the focus away from it. However, the crisis still remains. I have had some personal and political interaction with the health service during the past 12 or 18 months, and with respect to treatment from the cradle to the grave, it is in tatters. What an elderly person going through an accident and emergency department of any hospital has to put up with, and we have heard about a number of those departments in the southern region in the last period, amounts to cruelty in the extreme. I know for a fact that families are thinking twice and three times before calling an ambulance to bring an elderly relative to hospital because they believe they can care for them better at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Reference was made to the cleanliness of hospitals. It is a basic requirement to ensure they are kept clean. Some nurses work day and night trying to mind patients in the accident and emergency departments and in other parts of the hospitals, but the system is crumbling. There are queues of people waiting for services in all facets of health. Previous speakers spoke about people waiting for cataract and hip operations and for other treatments. There is talk of the health service improving and of the figures improving, but the health service is not improving. A fine report was published today on the way we will fund our health service for the next ten years, but we must accept that as we approach 1 June 2017, every aspect of the health service is in crisis. What way will it be come 1 November, 1 December or even over next Christmas when it is in crisis now?</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> The worst part of our health service is the inadequate care being provided for our elderly people. We should be able to provide the best possible care for our elderly people when they need it and are at their most vulnerable, but it is not there. I know of an incident where an elderly man not alone was not able to get a bed but was taken off the trolley and given a seat instead. Is that acceptable? There are five Ministers supposed to be running the Department and there is more money, but is that acceptable? Until such time as someone takes absolute accountability for the service, it will not improve. Taking basic measures would improve it a great deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_887">There is no doubt there is a serious crisis in our health service. Like other Deputies, every week my clinic is full of people trying to access services. I will cite one example. I am dealing with an independent 76 year old lady who has been waiting for more than 18 months at this stage to have a hip operation, and she is in excruciating pain. I have seen her X-ray and it was shocking to see the state of her hip as she has virtually no hip socket and the pain is unbearable. She may have to go into a nursing home or she may have to have around-the-clock care, and how much will that cost the State? She has waited for the operation and if she does not have it fairly promptly, she will be in serious bother very soon. She recently went to her general practitioner in desperation and wanted to pay privately for the operation with some savings she had, and her family were also prepared to help her. I cannot understand why no one ever directed this lady to the cross-Border health care initiative. She could avail of the operation in a private hospital in the North and she could claim the money back. There seems to be no emphasis on that initiative and that should be examined. It should be developed and promoted more. It is not being advertised. I do not know the reason for that. It appears that the consultants do not want it to work. That is my view.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> We can talk about the figures. Some 10,900 - almost 11,000 - children are on hospital waiting lists, 4,600 of whom have been on them for more than 18 months, and 46,000 people have been waiting for 18 months to see a consultant. It is horrendous. The inpatient figures for University Hospital Galway are 11,000. We have to tackle this problem. It is getting worse. Our people have little or no faith in the health system. It is to be hoped this motion will move matters forward and we will see an improvement in the system in the very near future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_889">I compliment my esteemed colleague, Deputy Kelleher, on tabling this motion. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow my colleague, Deputy Aylward, to contribute and we will be as brief as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> The programme for Government provides that continued investment of €50 million per year would be made available to reduce waiting lists and overcrowding, particularly for urgent cases and for those who have been waiting longest, yet more than 660,000 people are on hospital waiting lists. Alarmingly, this represents a steady increase of approximately 30,000 since last February. Aside from the distress these long and protracted waiting lists have on patients and their families and the impact it has on their medical conditions, there is also the knock-on effect waiting lists and overcrowding have on day-to-day treatments and procedures, especially if emergency departments are only dealing with overcrowding and emergency situations. There is no doubt that making more facilities available at primary care level would help alleviate the pressures experienced in hospital waiting rooms and emergency room, ER, departments. However, it also needs to be noted that extra resources afforded to general hospitals would certainly ease the burden on the larger university hospitals. For example, I know that if progress were made on a rehabilitation unit and an endoscopy unit for Bantry General Hospital in Cork South-West and if those facilities were in place, there would be no need for many patients to attend various Cork city hospitals for such treatments. Efforts to address waiting lists and overcrowding should be all-encompassing and segregating inefficiencies in the health system will prove to be counterproductive in the long run.</p>

        <speech by="#BobbyAylward" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_891">My colleagues adhered to their time allocation and I thank them for the time they have allocated me. I wish to raise the issue of University Hospital Waterford. I understand the mobile cath lab is due to come on line this summer to help alleviate the cardiac waiting lists in the south east. Will the Minister of State update us on this? I received confirmation from the Minister, Deputy Harris, via a parliamentary question, that the new mobile unit will focus on the outstanding waiting list for diagnostic angiograms. That concerns me as more people will be diagnosed more quickly but the current facility will have limited extra capacity to carry out follow-up procedures resulting from these additional angiograms. I understand an additional €500,000 has been allocated in line with a recommendation of the Herity report to provide an additional eight hours' cath lab activity per week. That is not enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> It is projected that 30% of patients would require additional procedures while it is anticipated that a total of 1,500 diagnostic procedures could be carried out in the mobile lab annually. This would result in an additional 450 extra people being added to the waiting lists for cardiac procedures at the existing cath lab at Waterford hospital each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> All this deflects from the overarching need for a second permanent cath lab, working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that is the main issue. There is virtually no change to the current situation in the south east where we have no provision for cardiology cover at 5 p.m. every weekday and no availability at all at the weekend. We need 24-7 cardiac services in the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I know my time is up but I also want to mention the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. It is more than a year since we have had the confidence and supply agreement and yet not one person has been treated through the NTPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I also have serious concerns about the National Rehabilitation Hospital and people with brain injuries are waiting on beds in that hospital. I know of two or three patients who are waiting on beds there and I cannot do anything for them. I am in constant contact with the hospital and I have still had no results for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The Scoliosis Advocacy Group was founded by two great ladies from Kilkenny, and we have been told of the Government's commitment to a four-month maximum wait time for scoliosis surgical treatment, yet parents were told last week that the waiting lists remain at 18 months. No progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> Those are the questions that need to be answered and that we need to debate tonight. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me that time.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_899">I apologise on behalf of the Minister who could not remain in the House for the debate as he had other business to which he had to attend. I advise Deputy Mattie McGrath that I and many of us have a conscience and that is why we are here debating this issue. On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Members who raised this matter for their considerate contributions. It is clear from the debate that the House shares the Minister's commitment and determination, and that of the Government, to do better for our patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> As the Minister for Health mentioned earlier in the debate, the cross-party Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare published its final report today.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">This is indeed a seminal moment on our path towards improved health services in Ireland. I take this opportunity to commend the members of the committee on the exceptional contribution of time and effort to this endeavour during the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> We are living longer and are healthier than ever before, and this is something to be celebrated. However, it also means that there are increasing demands on our health care resources. The Government is aware that if we are to break the vicious cycle of overcrowding and long waiting lists in our hospitals, we need to put in place the fundamental building blocks for our health service. I am confident that the recommendations put forward by the committee will help steer us in the right direction and I look forward to the upcoming debate on the report in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I now wish to return to a couple of items in the Fianna Fáil motion that the Minister did not have the opportunity to cover in detail. With regard to better utilisation of hospitals without 24-7 accident and emergency departments for the purposes of elective surgery, this proposal is also in line with the plans currently being implemented by this Government in respect of hospital groups. Hospitals are now starting to work together to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care and ensuring that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals. Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services while reorganising these services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves. In this way, there is a strong role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide more services, not less. The challenge is to ensure that they provide the right type of services, which can safely be delivered in these settings, in order that we maximise the benefit to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> The Fianna Fáil motion also refers to increased utilisation of community hospitals. The priority of the Minister for Health is to ensure that older people get the best care possible. For many, that care can be provided in their own homes and communities. Community hospitals are an essential part of our national infrastructure of public nursing homes, providing a mixture of long-stay and short-stay care. These short-stay beds include step-up and step-down care, intermediate, rehabilitation and respite care, which are used in a flexible manner to meet local needs at any given time. This relieves pressures, particularly in the acute sector, by preventing unnecessary admissions to hospitals and facilitating timely discharge. They are also essential to ensure older people can be cared for in their local community. GP access to these short-stay beds maximises the efficient usage of these beds as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context but, notwithstanding this, the care delivered to residents is generally of the highest standard. It is important, therefore, that we consolidate our existing stock and this is the aim of the five-year capital programme for community nursing units announced last year. This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities. In this regard, although improving hospital services is essential, we cannot underestimate the importance of moving away from a hospital-centric model of care and understanding the interrelated, interdependent nature of the environment within which public hospitals operate. A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to a decisive shift towards primary care so that better care, close to home, can be provided for in communities throughout the country. The Government wants to develop and expand the capacity in primary care in order to encompass health promotion, prevention, early identification, simple and early interventions, as well as patient empowerment. This proposed expansion in the range of services and capacity available within primary and community care can help to keep people well and minimise, as far as possible, the number of patients admitted to hospitals in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> We also need to intensify our efforts to invest in our health and well-being and tackle the rising trend of chronic disease. The Healthy Ireland framework provides the overarching context for the health strategy of the future and, as such, is the blueprint for the ongoing broad range of work taking place across Government aimed at shifting our focus more to population well-being and disease prevention, as well as reducing health inequalities. Earlier this month, the new brief intervention model, Making Every Contact Count, was published by the HSE. This approach recognises that among the 30 million contacts our population has with the health services annually, there is an opportunity to effect behaviour change if necessary, focusing on the four key areas of tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and unhealthy eating. Implementing Making Every Contact Count in all parts of our health service will be a significant step towards achieving that fundamental shift to prevention, health promotion and patient empowerment required to achieve a healthier Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> I know we all wish for a better health service and improved hospital services. I assure my colleagues that this remains a priority for the Government and that we will continue to work hard and stay focused on this issue. I have taken a number of notes from some speakers and will raise the matters with the Minister, particularly those regarding different hospitals around the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niamh Smyth<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_909">I commend my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, on putting forward this motion as provision of quality, yet affordable, health care is one of the greatest challenges facing our society. Patients seeking medical care expect to be met with delays of a reasonable time but for latitude to be stretched over a series of months and even years, with little to no treatment, care or assurance is simply not acceptable. My party and I are exasperated by the lengthy times patients spend on waiting lists but our concern is only eclipsed by those on the list who must deal with the shortfall in our national health care system. The steady upward trend of those waiting for medical attention is indicative that our health care system is operating neither effectively nor at capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> In my constituency, Cavan General Hospital has experienced a 236% increase in the number of people on outpatient waiting lists waiting 12 or more months for appointments between April 2016 and today. That means there are 2,350 people on outpatient waiting lists, while national figures are even more appalling. At the end of April, 654 people were waiting for inpatient appointments, 115 more than at this time last year. What will it take for the Government to address these shortfalls in our health care system? These incredible delays mean that anguished patients in our constituencies have to manage for months and even years on end. We must take steps to amend the capacity shortfalls in our health service before another patient falls victim to such inadequacies.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> Many of my constituents cite incredibly long waiting times for procedures such as hip and knee replacements, cataract surgeries and other causes of concern. Patients in need of hip and knee replacements must give up active lives and turn to being inactive. I am conscious of the time but I would appreciate if the Minister of State could reply on some of the matters I raised.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_912">I thank Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion for discussion. There is no question but that the matter to which it relates is very serious. I have listened with interest to many previous speakers. I had intended to say something different but I will read into the record an email I received today, 30 May 2017, at 2.31 p.m. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_913">Hello Eamon. I am getting in touch with you on behalf of my husband. His name is [...]. He is 72 years old and is waiting on a heart procedure to be done in the Mater hospital. The procedure my husband is waiting to have is called a pulmonary vein isolation. He was up there in the Mater in January for assessment and he was told there is a two-year waiting list but because of his urgent situation, they would try to get him seen to, hopefully within six months. I am told today that is not going to happen now.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">This woman is very distressed and disappointed. She continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_915">I hate having to sit by and watch my husband deteriorate. His respiratory consultant told him he would have to come off heart medication as it is impacting very negatively on his breathing and lungs but his cardiac consultant said, no, he cannot come off heart medication as it is keeping him alive until he has this procedure done. I am begging with you and imploring upon you to please help me to help him have this procedure done as soon as possible. We are ordinary people who have worked hard all our lives but could not afford private health insurance any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">They are on their own. The woman concludes, "We would be prepared to travel anywhere in Europe as long as he can get this done soon."</p>
          <p eId="para_917">I could bring in 25 more of these emails. I have another case of a lady with a 3-cm aneurysm in her brain waiting for an operation in Beaumont Hospital. If it reaches 5 cm, it is over. This lady is 42 years of age. This is what is happening in the real world. We can criticise the National Treatment Purchase Fund and everything else but it worked when it was in operation. These people are waiting and if they can avail of it, lives will be saved. It may be happening already - I do not know as I am not a doctor or consultant - but if something is not done very soon, people will die waiting.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_918">I compliment Deputy Kelleher on tabling the motion. Like my colleagues, I too feel very strongly about the lack of usage of the National Treatment Purchase Fund of which there was criticism while it was in operation. I note the Sinn Féin Member is leaving and that Sinn Féin spoke earlier about being anti-privatisation. As Deputy Scanlon has just said, parents and families do not mind once they get access to the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> Believe it or not, Galway Hour on Twitter is covering these proceedings as we speak. At this minute, people are talking about tonsillitis and children who saw consultants last July but still cannot get appointments to get their tonsils out as we head into the month of June. Children are suffering infection after infection. This is just one snippet of many describing what is happening. A number of people call into my clinic regularly to discuss cataract procedures. They wait for over two years and are told they will be lucky to have the procedure done in the next year and a half. Another example I have in front of me concerns osteoporosis and access to the DEXA machine in Galway. This time last year, there was a 20-year waiting list for people to get their bone density checked. This is the real world we face day in, day out. If we could access the National Treatment Purchase Fund and get people off these lists and bring them down to a manageable level, perhaps we would have fewer debates about this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-05-30T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_920">I welcome the contributions of all the Deputies who contributed but I am very disappointed not more groups took time to speak on this important issue. Not only in the context of my motion but in health debates in general, there has always been a strong element of robust debate and analysis in this Chamber. However, it is quite incredible that we could not fill the full allocation of two hours this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> The motion was tabled because we must consistently highlight the deficiencies and inadequacies in our health service. Deputy Eamon Scanlon, for example, highlighted a genuine, real case, one of the 660,000 people out there on waiting lists. The motion was tabled with that purpose in mind and also to come up with some observations and solutions in the area of health care. We need to increase the times during which diagnostic tests are available across hospitals. We must move to a system of provision from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week. We need to ensure the wards that are closed are opened up. We talk about a lack of beds and bed capacity reviews but, at the same time, wards close simply because we cannot retain or recruit enough nursing staff to populate them. Even within the current crisis, there are solutions that may resolve some of the problems to which the Deputies referred in the context of individuals waiting inordinate periods for diagnostics, operations or procedures. It is within the Government's gift to do these things; it just needs a little honest commitment, a bit of backbone and a Government willing to consider the challenges out there and try to resolve them step by step.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> We have listened to lectures from those who oppose the National Treatment Purchase Fund. I have no ideological view as to whether the National Treatment Purchase Fund is right or wrong. My only view is that it does benefit those who are waiting inordinate periods on the public waiting lists. It drove down waiting lists over a protracted period and it was a positive initiative. Those who support Maduro and Stalinist parties can have their views but I simply suggest that in the meantime, while our public hospital system does not have the capacity to deal with what is presented to it daily, the National Treatment Purchase Fund is a solution in the short and medium term while we wrap up capacity in our public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> In the motion, we highlight the deficiencies and come up with sensible suggestions which, I believe, the Minister of State and her colleagues can, with a small bit of imagination and grit, resolve. I ask her to consider, for example, the area of diagnostics. Day in, day out, there is not a Deputy in this House who does not table a Dáil question about someone attending his or her clinic or advice centre who simply cannot get a diagnosis. These people are waiting years to get diagnoses. They do not know what is wrong with them. The doctor or general practitioner will write a referral stating the matter is urgent; six months or a year will pass; there will be delays, prevarication and cancellations. Last year alone, 36,000 operations were cancelled in the public health system - 36,000 people who had in their own mind been prepared for an operation and it was cancelled. I have dealt with cases of women who were scheduled for double mastectomies and gowned up in a hospital but whose procedures were cancelled at the last minute. That is what is happening out there. I do not wish to be alarmist, but we have an obligation and a duty to come up with solutions. If we do not accept first of all that we have massive problems, as identified by my colleagues this evening, we will consistently go on the merry-go-round of pretence and spin while 660,000 people languish on waiting lists and 350 or 360 people a day languish on trolleys. It is a sad indictment on everyone but it is the Government's turn now to come up with some of the solutions and to address some of the inadequacies. Tonight's motion, in the context of the issues I have highlighted, would make an impact on some people's lives if the Government acted upon it. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
