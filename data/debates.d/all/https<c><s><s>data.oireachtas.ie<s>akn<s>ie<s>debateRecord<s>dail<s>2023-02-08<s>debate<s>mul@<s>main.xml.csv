We extend our solidarity to all those hurt and injured and urge the global community to rally to the support of these devastated communities. Last Thursday the European Central Bank increased interest rates for the fifth time since July of last year. For the almost 200,000 households with a tracker mortgage this will result in an immediate and significant impact. The high-street banks, namely, Bank of Ireland and AIB, are starting to increase their rates. Vulture funds are increasing rates aggressively, which is leaving some paying interest rates of 7.5%. The net result of this is that tens of thousands of workers and families are paying hundreds of euro extra per month compared with this time last year. For those with even modest mortgages this can equate to thousands of euro extra per year. This is on top of a cost-of-living crisis that, mortgages aside, is putting real pressure on household finances. The cost of heating is up, the cost of filling the car is up and the cost of everyday shopping is up. The list goes on. For those whose mortgage bills are skyrocketing this is causing massive stress and anxiety. Is cúis mhór struis d’oibrithe agus do theaghlaigh é seo agus caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh anois. One person I spoke to this morning told me their annual mortgage payment has now increased by more than €3,000, and that is before the increase due next month. It is now time to introduce timely, targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief to support workers and families who are put to the pin of their collar. This evening we in Sinn Féin will bring a motion to the Dáil that provides a meaningful solution for households that have had to contend with five interest rate hikes in less than a year. Our proposal to reintroduce mortgage interest relief will be in place for 12 months to absorb a portion of borrowers’ increased interest costs. This relief would amount to 30% of the increased interest costs compared with June of last year, with a maximum benefit of €1,500. As with every measure to combat the cost-of-living crisis we appreciate the State cannot cover the entire cost but it can, and should, lend a helping hand. It should do this now; this is what is needed. The Government ruled out this approach out when my colleague, Teachta Doherty, put the proposal to it in December. Since then the situation has worsened, and worsened considerably. We now see tens of thousands of workers and families needing support. Will the Taoiseach support our proposal, and will mortgage interest relief be reintroduced without delay?

Some are mourning family members and others are worried about family members and friends. As part of an initial response, the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, has allocated €2 million in emergency assistance to the Red Cross and the UN to help with the effort. We will be in touch with the authorities in Türkiye and in Syria to offer more help if we can. Tharla crith talún millteanach sa tSiria agus sa Tuirc. Fuair deich míle duine bás agus tá go leor daoine gortaithe freisin. Ar son an Rialtais agus ar son muintir na hÉireann, tá brón an domhain orainn. Cabhróidh an Rialtas. Beidh €2 milliún ar fáil mar thacaíocht chun cabhair a thabhairt do mhuintir na Tuirce agus muintir na Siria. Regarding the Deputy's question, and I want to thank her for raising this important issue, as the House will appreciate the formulation and implementation of monetary policy is an independent matter for the Central Bank. The European Central Bank acts independently of the governments of Europe and governments do not set interest rates. The rises in interest rates are most unwelcome for anyone who is borrowing, particularly home owners and those with tracker mortgages. There are roughly 200,000 people who now, almost every other month, receive a letter in the post telling them that their monthly repayments are going up, and up, and up. While interest rates had been relatively low by historical standards, they have risen a lot in the last year or so and that is something I think all of us will have experienced from our constituency work. The European Central Bank's governing council has indicated that interest rates will have to rise at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficient to ensure a return to inflation of around 2%. It is important to acknowledge that the reason the European Central Bank is increasing interest rates is to bring inflation down and to restore price stability and that is something that will benefit everyone. I hope we are approaching the peak of the current interest rate cycle but there is no guarantee that is the case. It is something we will discuss at the European Council tomorrow when I am in Brussels. I do not know if the Governor of the Central Bank is able to attend this meeting but it is certainly something we will discuss at Head of Government and Head of State level because I know it is a matter of concern across the Continent. The Government is currently reviewing what more we can do to alleviate the rising cost of living of which higher interest rates are part. We will be able to make an announcement around the middle of the month as to what else we can do to help with the cost of living as we go into the spring. The changed interest rate environment will not have a uniform impact on all borrowers and depending on particular situations, such as individual contracts, some borrowers will experience higher increases than others. Thankfully the average Irish interest rate on new mortgages is now below the eurozone average. Even though it had been higher than the eurozone average, we now have the third lowest mortgage rates in the eurozone. In fact, a significant portion of new mortgages, more than 90% of new mortgages, are now fixed rate mortgages and this will go some way to protect borrowers but I know that is of no solace at all to people who hold tracker mortgages. Mortgage interest relief was phased out between 2009 and 2020 and at its peak the relief cost more than €700 million per year. It is not something we are currently considering but it is not something we would rule out for the future. It is the kind of thing we would do normally in the context of a budget when we have to weigh up many other choices and options to help people. We cannot do them all; we can only ever do a small number. Certainly if Sinn Féin has a proposal and wants to produce a paper on it, we would be happy to consider that, to cost it, to work out the various practicalities and to issue a more formal response.

As he said, there are 186,000 borrowers on tracker mortgages, 129,000 on standard variable rates and more than 113,000 with non-banks and vulture funds. Some borrowers are being affected very dramatically and very immediately with these five hikes so far and with more to come. I do not believe the Government should hesitate on this matter.The reality, as we know, is that families and workers were struggling anyhow with a cost-of-living crisis. For lots of families, this has now, as they say, put the tin hat on things for them. We need to see Government intervention. I appeal to the Taoiseach not only to support our proposal and our motion this evening, but also to include targeted, time-bound mortgage interest relief as the package of measures that needs to be introduced now.

It would be wrong of me not to acknowledge that the European Central Bank, ECB, is raising interest rates to bring inflation down and to restore price stability. This is why it is being done. Unfortunately, the impact on people who have tracker mortgages is very severe. We are happy to consider any proposals that the Sinn Féin party wants to make. We are happy to examine them and to cost them. We would need to know the cost and that is significant. This does matter, particularly out of the context of the budget cycle. Second, we would have to examine it from a holistic point of view as well. Mortgage rates in Ireland have been at historically-low levels now for a number of years. In some cases, people who were paying very low rates on tracker mortgages are now paying rates that other people have actually been paying for quite some time. We would have to take this into account in any benefit or concession we might give to people.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	6	I also express my thoughts and sympathies to the people of Türkiye and Syria, who have been so badly impacted by Monday's devastating earthquakes. The huge loss of life and utter destruction are truly horrific and heartbreaking. We all share that sentiment. I raise the issue of the Attorney General's report into the nursing home and disability payments scandal. It is not surprising that the Attorney General has provided such a staunch defence of the legal strategy that was devised and endorsed by his own office and successive Governments over many years. What does come as a surprise, however, is how incredibly blinkered the report is. Throughout it, cost containment is repeatedly conflated with the public interest. In summary, keeping costs down is good and screwing over vulnerable citizens is legally sound. Even in the case of the State effectively illegally stealing disability payments from the most vulnerable citizens, the Attorney General tells us there is "no positive legal obligation" to repay those funds. As the Taoiseach himself said last week, this is a case that does "not have a [legal] leg to stand on". I have been thinking about that line, "no positive legal obligation", since I read it in the report. I must say that I find that really extraordinary. This is a bald admission that the State had no valid legal authority to withdraw the meagre disability payments from extremely vulnerable citizens who were in residential care and no strict legal duty to repay that money, so, effectively, it did not bother. I wonder how that defence would have gone down if the banks had tried to use it, for example, in the tracker mortgages that we have just heard about. I refer to large institutions, with much deeper pockets than the impoverished consumers it ripped off, effectively saying that if those customers thought they were badly treated they should come and sue them individually. Would the Taoiseach have been happy to see the banks adopt that scorched earth approach rather than, and it must be said belatedly so, identifying the customers who were impacted and paying redress as well as the large fines imposed by the regulator? In this case, we have a State behaving with less of a moral compass than the banks, which I find is really saying something. What the Attorney General fails to grasp is that only a small minority of people has the capacity even to contemplate suing the State. The State would not lose its house at the end of the legal proceedings but those suing might. Irish people do not expect or want the State to force the most vulnerable citizens to litigate to enforce their legal rights and entitlements. We expect the State to defend and vindicate these rights. At the very least, we expect the State to own up to its wrongs and to undo those wrongs. The legal strategy here is not something that is complicated or knowledgeable in terms of the legal formulation.It was a very simple approach to keep our heads down and hope we get away with it, having ripped off all those vulnerable people. Is the Taoiseach still happy to stand over that strategy having read the defence in the Attorney General's report?

I emphasise that this is largely an historical issue. It relates to nursing home charges prior to 2005, which is more than 18 years ago and disability payments prior to 2007 or perhaps even prior to 1996 and largely relates to laws from the 1970s. We do not have all the facts yet - nobody does. As I said last week, we will do whatever is legally required, just and in the public interest. The Attorney General's report is now published. It takes about 20 or 25 minutes to read. I encourage everyone to read it from cover to cover. The House can debate it tomorrow and I know Oireachtas joint committees will also want to discuss this matter. The Ministers for Health and Social Protection will study this matter and revert to Government with a further report in under three months. There are some important points from the Attorney General's report which are worth putting on the record of the House. The Attorney General points out very clearly that the State's only interest is the public interest. There is no other interest that the State can have regard to than the public interest. That means taking into account the justice of any claims made by people on the State. It means taking into account taxpayers as well as taking into account those who depend on public services today, such as children in our schools, patients in our hospitals and older people who need home care. The Attorney General points out that anyone taking a case or defending case has a legal strategy. Either someone taking a case against the State or the State itself has a legal strategy. That is confidential and the fact that is confidential or secret is not sinister in any way. He also points out that anyone taking a case or defending a case has privilege. It would not be fair for anyone to expect one side to waive privilege if the other is not willing to do so. He also points out that Cabinet documents are confidential and are protected by the Constitution. Even the Government does not have the authority to release them. He also points out that the State is it is not a normal litigant. I have heard people describe the State as being callous or operating like a company in the way it defends cases. That is not the case. All the time the Government takes decisions do things that it is not legally required to do. We have a 100% redress scheme for mica and for people who live in defective apartment blocks. No court has found, nor would any court find, that the State, central Government, is 100% responsible for that. There are other examples such as the symphysiotomy scheme established by the former Minister James Reilly and followed through by me when I was Minister for Health, which provided a redress scheme even though the women concerned, with one extreme exception, lost all their cases in court. We also have other schemes such as the mother and baby homes institutions scheme, for example, where the commission of investigation found many people responsible for what happened there but only the State has stepped forward to fund a redress scheme. Importantly, he also points out that in settling it case, it is essentially a compromise. Settling a case does not mean acceptance of being in the wrong. It is done by agreement on both sides. Cases cannot be settled unless both sides agree to settlements. Nobody can be forced to a settlement. They are always free to have their case tested in court and these cases may yet be tested in court.

What exactly will the Ministers for Health and Social Protection be looking at for the next three months? Is it the Attorney General's report? Is it the substance of the issue? Are they looking at identifying individuals who may have been impacted? Are they looking at the possibility of repayments? Exactly what is it? I wonder if the same positive legal obligation was considered when the repayment of junior bondholders was being considered because people are validly making a comparison between the two and how the State treated the two. Other people feel that this delay-and-deny tactic is repeatedly the State's strategy. For example, over a 20-year period 100 personnel in Casement Aerodrome have prematurely died. It is up to the individuals or their families to do anything. This is about how the State treats its citizens. What exactly will the two Ministers be looking at? Is it just the Attorney General's report or is it more?

Leaving that aside, Ministers will look at this in the round. Of course, it will not take them three months to look at the Attorney General's report but they will have to look at many documents going back to the 1970s and 1980s and listen to what the House and what people have to say at the Oireachtas joint committee. In respect of the disabled persons maintenance allowance, DPMA, payments, it is important to say again that this is an historic issue that relates to the period before 2007, and the partially leaked draft memo did not cover all of the facts. One thing we now know since then is that there were actually three periods involved: a period between 1983 and 1996, when the law was one thing; a period between 1996 and 1999, when the law was another thing; and a period between 1999 and 2007, when the law was different again. That gives an example of how much more complexity and truth there is to this than what has been presented in certain places in recent times.

If you go online, open the newspaper or turn on the radio, you cannot do any of those things these days without reading or hearing about the far right. They have come to prominence through their organisational support for anti-refugee protests, but who are they? The largest such party is the National Party. It is described by the Far Right Observatory as being anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ+, and white nationalist. Its leader has attended meetings of European neo-Nazi groups. The observatory lists about a dozen such groups and remarks that many have adopted the great replacement conspiracy theory which argues that white populations are being deliberately displaced from their homelands as part of a plot often blamed on Jews or globalists. Hardcore racists in some of these groups have tried to promote the racist myth of a link between black and brown men and the incidence of gender-based violence. These groups have never displayed any concern for the victims of gender-based violence before and are simply trying to exploit the issue for racist ends. An opinion piece by Justine McCarthy in The Irish Times last week, entitled “Government needs to acknowledge its role in creating anti-migrant tinderbox”, said the following, "The spurning of economic immigrants arriving on Irish shores while seeking special status for Ireland’s own ... emigrants abroad is the sort of 'do ... [as] I say, not ... [as] I do' double standard that gives succour to xenophobic agitators worming their ideology of hate into the public mindset." I could add that a Government which boasts about deporting nearly 130 people in January and signs this country up to a fortress Europe policy that has resulted in nearly 25,000 men, women and children drowning in the Mediterranean in the past ten years only helps to feed an anti-refugee narrative that the far right taps into. It is on the issue of housing, however, that this Government has handed the racists their number one gift. The Government’s housing policy has forced record numbers into emergency accommodation, it has sat idly by as 50,000 houses were left vacant for six years or more, and it has allowed speculators to hoard vast tracts of land in the middle of a housing emergency. It is, of course, in large measure true that refugees and those hardest hit by the housing crisis are not competing for the same spaces. I preface the following comment, however, by saying unambiguously that refugees are welcome here. When many people compare the efforts this Government has made to house Ukrainian refugees, inadequate as those efforts are in many respects, with the lack of effort and urgency in housing the victims of this housing crisis, they feel aggrieved and the door opens up for the racist messaging of the far right, facilitated by this Government. Do you, Deputy Varadkar, accept that your Government’s appalling failures on the housing issue have given a real gift to the far right in this country, and what do you intend to do now to undo the damage that you and your Government have done?

I have often had the opportunity to speak to our colleagues in the US, in the US Administration and to Members of Congress.When I say to them that we wish to have something done to help undocumented Irish people in the US or, indeed, undocumented people from other parts of the world, I precisely point to what we have done, because what we have done as a Government in the past number of years is put in place schemes to allow undocumented migrants to become documented. I refer to those who came here on students visas and those who built lives here and had children here, who became undocumented. All we are ever asking the US administration to do is what we have already done for undocumented people in our country. I totally reject the argument of double standards on that point, because it is misinformed. I think we will both agree on one point: there is absolutely no excuse for racism of any form. I had the opportunity to meet with the trade union and business leaders this morning under the Labour Employer Economic Forum. One of the leaders of one of the health unions told me there had been protests outside of a hospital in Dublin in recent times, against foreign nationals who are members of staff in that hospital. While there is no excuse for any form of racism, under any circumstances, it really is a low blow and a new low if healthcare workers, to whom we are so grateful for having come here, are now facing protests and racism from those who do not believe they are welcome here. That is really appalling and the Government will fight against it. It is one of the reasons for our national action plan against racism, which will be published in early March. The plan will be led by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, but will be a whole-of-government effort and will include funding for integration and counteracting racist activities. Racists and the far right will blame whatever problem the country is facing on migrants. That is the way it works and the way they think. If we have a housing crisis, it will be said the foreigners are taking our homes. If we have an unemployment crisis, it will be said the foreigners are taking our jobs. If we have high levels of crime, they will blame the foreigners for those. If there is violence against women - one of the oldest tropes in the book - they will blame it on migrants and people who have come here from overseas, especially those who are brown or black. We should not play into those arguments and I think the Deputy is doing that inadvertently. Whatever problem any country faces, they will blame it on the brown man or the brown woman. It is housing now, but it could just as easily be unemployment or crime. The Deputy needs to be careful that he does not inadvertently assist them in the kinds of things he is saying.

Does the housing crisis add to the crisis of racism in Irish society? Without any question, it does. Of course, they will blame everything. However, the housing crisis is a gift to them, which is why I have no faith in the Government to sort this issue. My faith is in the ordinary people. We need a mass movement from below in Irish society on this issue. That is why I am very pleased that on Saturday, 18 February, the Le Chéile coalition is calling people out on to the streets. We need masses of ordinary people to rally against racism and fascism. This needs to be a demonstration which is not just anti-racist, but anti-Government as well, and calls for action on housing and the social crisis. I appeal to people to attend in very large numbers. I note the fact that Fórsa is backing this demonstration and calling on its members to attend. That example needs to be followed. I call on every union in the country to make a similar call and help to make this a massive demonstration on 18 February.

I ask the Deputy to consider his approach to this, and to consider it carefully. I know he is well-intentioned and fervently anti-racist and internationalist. I absolutely accept that. I just ask the Deputy not to play their game inadvertently. Do not make any excuses for them. No matter what problem a country faces, the far right and racists will blame it on migrants. If we did not have a housing crisis and we had an unemployment crisis, they would blame that on the migrants instead.If we did not have an unemployment crisis, they would blame crime on the migrants.

I wish to speak, in the same vein as the previous speaker, about the rise in racism in this country. I am sure the Taoiseach agrees the racist sentiment which is growing and has become a lot more mainstream in Ireland in recent months is incredibly concerning and needs to be addressed urgently. The far right is doing a great job of exploiting the public's real and legitimate fears and using them to stoke racist hatred. It is doing this under the guise of Irishness and nationalism but the ideas being spread could not be more anti-Irish. Emigration has been a massive part of Irish history and identity, and to ignore this aspect of ourselves is to ignore what it means to be Irish. We know that 1 million Irish people emigrated during the Famine and we also know how badly many of our migrant ancestors were treated during this very difficult time in Irish history. Yet, when history repeats itself in other countries, when they are facing war and famine just as we did, we turn our backs on immigrants and, in doing so, we turn our backs on our ancestors as well. This is not only shameful, it is also hypocritical because emigration did not only define Irish identity 200 years ago but has continued to define us ever since. My parents emigrated in the 1960s and I was an economic migrant in the 1980s when I went to England to work, support myself and have a better quality of life. The only difference is that I could legally enter England at that time. This is all immigrants to our country look for: the opportunity to have a better quality of life. We have never been denied this so why should we deny anyone else this opportunity? A RED C survey five months ago showed that 70% of young people here were considering moving abroad for a better quality of life elsewhere. How can we accept this while at the same time condemning anyone living in Ireland for the exact same reasons? How is it that we have become so hypocritical? The sad reality is that the State plays a role in this, subtly at times but more obviously at other times. The remarks of some Government backbenchers of late have attested to this and some opportunists in opposition have fed into the dangerous narrative that Ireland is full, despite the fact our population has not yet returned to pre-Famine levels and we have more than 150,000 vacant homes in this country. There is no doubt the Government is using this rise in racism to protect itself. Culture wars are in the Government's interest because they stop communities organising around the things that actually matter to them, like housing, unemployment and the climate crisis. As long as we are pointing the finger at immigrants and asylum seekers, we are not organising around the things that matter and are not pointing the finger at those who are actually at fault. The reality is that if every migrant left Ireland tomorrow, we would still have a housing crisis, a cost-of-living crisis and a crisis in our healthcare system. In fact, the latter would probably be even worse because so many economic migrants work in our healthcare system and keep it functioning. Will the Government take responsibility for the fact its failed policies have caused the housing and healthcare crises in this country, leading to a rise in the alt right?

Almost every country in the developed world is facing some form of housing or health crisis. Governments in those countries are doing their best to deal with them, and that is exactly what we are doing here. It is our responsibility to put things right and we will do the best we can to do so. Again, I would ask the Deputy not to inadvertently make excuses for the far right or for racists. No matter what problem a country faces, and every country has some problem, the far right will blame that problem on the other, on the brown man or the brown woman. I ask the Deputy to please not inadvertently make excuses for them by pursuing the line of argument he is pursuing at the moment. I agree with the Deputy that Irish people understand migration better than most. Most of our families are formed by migration. My father came here from India. My mother is from Ireland but they met when they worked in the NHS in England. My sister lives in London. Every story of every Irish family is one of migration of some form or another. So many of my relatives live in the US. We understand migration better than most. We understand that, by and large, migration has been good for Ireland.The big tech companies that pay billions of euro in tax and allow our country to function the way it does have a very diverse international workforce. Those companies are not just here because of our favourable tax rates. One of the reasons they come here is that we are open to talent from all over the world. In any Irish hospital, it can be seen how diverse the workforce is there. Our public services simply would not function were it not for the fact that people come from other parts of the world to work here. We know how much migration has enriched our culture and made Ireland a much more interesting place in recent decades. That is why we should always emphasise the fact that countries that are open to migration tend to be countries that are wealthier, more successful and more stable, and that is why we should continue to be open to migration. There is a difference, though, between legal migration and illegal migration, and we should not be afraid to say that. There are many legal pathways to migration into Ireland. Last year, 30,000 Irish citizens returned home. Any Irish citizen can, of course, come and live in Ireland. UK citizens can do the same. Every year, tens of thousands, if not more, EU citizens come to live in Ireland. They can live anywhere in the European Union but they choose to come and live in Ireland, largely because of the economic opportunities we have to offer. Last year alone, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued 40,000 work permits, the highest number ever, to people from outside the European Union who are coming here to take up employment or to study. We should encourage people to avail of the many legal pathways to come into the county, including those I have outlined.

I was agreeing with much of what he was saying, but then he went and pulled out these tropes again that have been fired out everywhere, even by his backbenchers, regarding illegal immigrants coming to Ireland. The reality is, and the Taoiseach should check that with the Department of Justice, which is not the most friendly towards immigrants, that anybody who comes here and claims asylum is a legal immigrant. Those people are complying with the law. They come here and they claim asylum. That is legal.

I have a question for the Taoiseach, however.Will he, this week, avail of the opportunity to make a comprehensive statement about his actions and political decisions regarding nursing home charges and disabled persons? Likewise, will his colleagues in government the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy McEntee, and his predecessor as Minister for Health, Dr. James Reilly, make themselves available to the Houses of the Oireachtas to explain the political decisions, which in the end are what all of this is about?

A Barnardos report has disclosed really shameful levels of parental sacrifice because of poverty. It is obscene to see Shell reporting a profit of $40 billion for 2022, its highest in 115 years. BP's profits have doubled to £23 billion. We have called for a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies. The Government is committed to reviewing this. When can we have a debate on this? When will we see Government proposals on it? We need to see action taken on these obscene profits of energy companies at a time when there is so much hardship around the country?

Independent surveys have put the rate at 16% over the past three months. We are only 20 days from the end of February, as the Taoiseach knows, and many of the supports are to run out. Therefore, we need a debate in this House. The members of the Cabinet seem to be all over the place and there are mixed messages, with the Green Party not wanting to continue with the supports for fuel. Eighty-eight percent of fuel in this country is fossil fuel. Let us face it and be honest. The cost of living, including the cost of groceries, must be borne in mind, as must the tourism sector. People need certainty above anything else. While the Government dithers and squabbles, people are suffering. Their mental health is suffering and they are going to food banks. That is the reality on the ground. People need to know whether the supports will continue beyond the end of February, the shortest month of the year, and they need certainty.

On the windfall tax, I will have to speak to the Minister for Finance. However, we are bringing in a windfall tax and intend to use the money to help businesses and families struggling with the cost of living. On the question of making a statement on the matter Deputy McDonald raised, I will not be able to do that this week. I will be on a plane to Brussels in a few hours' time because I have to attend the European Council meeting and nobody can substitute for me. However, I am in this House twice a week and will be happy to answer any questions the Deputy has on any of those matters to the best of my ability.

The levels of child poverty in the State are absolutely unacceptable. We have seen the worsening situation for workers and families laid bare in a report by Barnardos, published this morning. The Taoiseach is probably familiar with its key findings. One in ten parents have used a food bank over the past year. That is double the rate for last year. One in five parents have not had enough food at some point to feed the children. Twenty-nine percent of parents are skipping meals so their children have enough to eat. This is Ireland in 2023, on the Taoiseach's watch. Families were already saddled with out-of-control rents, heating bills and so on. Child poverty, food poverty and wider poverty can be resolved but only if there is political resolve to do so. This is an issue that impacts not only families in receipt of social welfare but also families with one or both parents working. What package will the Taoiseach consider to include a living wage?We need a spring bonus for social welfare recipients.

They had been falling for several years on the Government's watch. I am sorry the Deputy was not willing to acknowledge that but they had been consistently falling because of the policies we pursued as a Government. Over the past year, the cost-of-living crisis has changed that and I acknowledge that many families are now really struggling to make ends meet in a way they were not only a year ago. We did a lot to help in the budget. This included increases in pension and welfare payments, reductions in income tax and in costs such as childcare fees, and with the rent credit. Over the coming weeks, we will examine what we can do to help people in the spring.

Last Thursday, I raised with the Tánaiste the need to resource the international protection accommodation services, IPAS, to ensure they had capacity to meet the housing needs of those from other countries seeking refuge here. Contracts for thousands of hotel beds currently used by refugees will expire very shortly. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has called on other Departments and State agencies to step up and offer spare housing. However, we see reports today that not one of 300 offers of property made by the HSE has been taken up by IPAS. Can the Taoiseach assure us that IPAS is sufficiently resourced to meet the needs of those who come here seeking refuge? Will he heed Labour's call for a dedicated Minister to co-ordinate the housing of refugees, to be located in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage? Will he ensure a co-ordinated cross-governmental approach to meeting the needs of those who are seeking refuge here and who are, in some cases, simply not being offered any housing?

There are quite a lot of vacancies we are not able to fill, although we are keen to do so. We have been seconding people from other parts of the public service because we really need staff in that area. The former chief executive of Limerick City and County Council, Conn Murray, is now heading up a task force to bring everyone together in an area that has been disjointed in the past. This task force is particularly focused on refurbishing buildings. We have appointed Mr. Murray to pull all of that together and to try to refurbish as many buildings as we can get our hands on in order that they will be available for Ukrainians and international protection applicants in the first instance, although we will also need these buildings into the future.

The students believe strongly in having an inclusive school and I hope there will be support for that application for funding. That visit was also a reminder for me that, despite being elected to represent all of our constituents and not just the electorate, we rarely hear the voices of children or representations on their behalf here in the Dáil. We may need new models of engagement to better capture and reflect young people's perspectives. On that point, I asked the students what they would like from their Government. They had a few different requests. They wanted money for kids and better playgrounds, which is a reasonable request. It may not be a surprise that the removal of homework also came up. This may be an obvious request for students to make but, when I read up on the issue, I saw there is merit to their suggestion. Homework for primary school-aged children has little pedagogical benefit. Will the Minister for Education review this practice to at least ensure our policy is based on evidence?

That is happening and it is something that Government and local authorities are very much investing in. I am interested in the debate about homework. I am not sure what is the right decision. My sense is that some homework is a good idea and that it is a good idea for kids to practise at home what they learn in school but I absolutely agree that our approach should be evidence-based.I have not studied the evidence and certainly would be interested to hear the Minister for Education's view on it.

The situation seems set to worsen. Kantar told us yesterday that the average household will spend nearly an extra €1,200 on groceries in 2023. Why then is the Government considering the scrapping of at least some of the cost of living supports for householders at the end of this month? The crisis remains; the supports should remain too. The Government and the State have a surplus of €5 billion. There should not be a single one of these supports cut in that situation. Any and all of these cuts should be opposed and resisted. Where does the Taoiseach stand on this issue?

Nobody on the Government side would deny that for a second. I do not know if it is correct to say that one in ten Irish families have gone to a food bank. That would be 200,000 families. I am not sure if that figure is correct but it is certainly more than it used to be and nobody is going to deny that. We see it as well in second exceptional needs payments where people go to the Department of Social Protection and to their community welfare officer. They look for help and get it. The numbers getting it are increasing. I believe that system is working, maybe not as well as it might work, but it is working. What we will consider over the next few weeks is which supports can continue into March and April and which ones cannot. We do have to balance the books and have regard to other demands on the public purse. One thing I will say is that we will bear in mind those who need the help the most and make sure that whatever package we put together is targeted.

In excess of €35 million has been spent in the last 20 years to progress a ring road. On Tuesday last, the Minister for Transport stated that the current plans for a ring road could not proceed and that the National Transport Authority, the local authority and the Department of Transport would have to look at a new transport strategy for Galway. The following day, in the Dáil, an Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, said that the N6 Galway ring road is essential for the growth and development of Galway city and the relief of unacceptable congestion. Galway City Council, Galway County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland have issued a joint statement confirming that they are committed to the project. However, there is now growing confusion and concern in Galway about the mixed messages from senior parties in government. Businesses and residents who are plagued with daily traffic congestion are worried about the lack of a commitment by the Minister for Transport. Can the Taoiseach please clearly outline his position and that of his Government regarding this vital piece of infrastructure for Galway?

It has been remitted to An Bord Pleanála for a decision, taking into account the climate action plan. I will be very straight with the Deputy. While there are different views within Government on this matter, which happens sometimes and sometimes is a healthy thing, I am a supporter of the Galway ring road. It is in the national development plan and the national development plan is Government policy. Therefore, if it gets planning permission, it will be funded. It is in the national development plan, and that is part of the programme for Government. I do not accept the view that it will necessarily be bad in terms of climate. It will take a long time to build it and by the time it has been built, I would hope the vast majority of our vehicles will be electric and 80% of our electricity will come from renewables. That will put a very different picture on it in terms of the emissions created and it will free up the city for cycling, buses and pedestrians.

The deer overpopulation situation is alarming throughout rural Ireland and parts of urban Ireland. There is actually a deer consultation open at the moment which closes this Friday. The lack of awareness, getting the message out about this consultation, is very poor. I am calling for the Government to insist on it being extended for at least a month.It is a health and safety issue for rural dwellers, road users, farmers, land owners and ordinary people. There have been numerous accidents around my county of Tipperary, Waterford, Limerick, Kerry and everywhere else. People have been seriously injured. There will be fatalities.

Unfortunately, there was a judicial review, which then went to the Court of Appeal. As I understand it, the Court of Appeal gave its final judgment on 19 July 2022, which was more than six months ago. Only one issue was outstanding - the effect on Northern vessels - and submissions were required on it. Here we are six months later, however, and the policy directive has still not been implemented. It is necessary for the conservation of our fishing stock, in particular sprat. After all of the times I have raised this matter, and in light of the urgency and necessity involved, could someone tell me why we are not implementing the judgment, given that nine of the ten conclusions were in favour with just one relating to Northern vessels outstanding?

The Caredoc team have met me several times on the matter of securing doctors from abroad to assist in tackling the significant workload. The atypical working scheme, AWS, visa was taking 30 working days to be issued while entry visas normally took 20 working days more, but the AWS permit only allows people to work in Ireland for 90 days. They must then leave the State and reapply. Entry visas are now taking up to eight weeks to be authorised, which is having a major impact. We need doctors to come and work in Ireland quickly, but of more importance is the need for an injury clinic in Carlow that makes use of the good facilities already in place and allows for the service's expansion so that it properly serves the people of Carlow, where there is significant demand. During the Minister's trip, he also visited our ambulance base. We asked for a temporary modular build there until the new build was completed. Will he fill me in on that?

We saw the loss of ten precious lives and others severely injured. Since then, the whole nation has wrapped its arms around that village, and particularly the families of those who lost loved ones. Unfortunately, some of those families are deeply distraught at the fact that TG4 is planning to broadcast a documentary tonight. A number of the families have contacted me directly and I know that they have also contacted TG4 directly. They are pleading with TG4 not to air this documentary because they believe it is too raw and the Garda investigation has still not been concluded. I know TG4, the excellent service it provides and its documentaries. Nobody is questioning the organisation's professionalism, or the fact that the tragedy and the families will be dealt with sensitively. The story of the heroes who were the first responders need to be told, but the families are asking, and indeed begging, that this is postponed until the Garda investigation is over. I ask the Taoiseach to join with me in asking TG4 to reconsider this matter with the families at the centre of it.

What I would ask TG4 to do is perhaps to sit down with the families concerned, maybe consult with them and, having done that, make a decision as to whether or not it is going to postpone the airing of the documentary. I am reluctant, as head of Government, to tell any broadcaster what it should or should not broadcast. I do not want to get into that space, but I do hear what the families are saying and I think we all feel their pain. I ask, at the very least, that TG4 would sit down with their representatives and discuss the matter, hear their case and try to understand it.

This is a vital facility due to continuing capacity problems in University Hospital Limerick, UHL. I ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health, if he wishes to respond, to consider locating this hub in the grounds of St. John's Hospital in Limerick. Can I get an assurance that St. John's Hospital will continue to play a central role in the delivery of health services in the midwest region?

When it comes to the surgical hubs, there are several options being looked at, one of which is on a site-by-site basis. For example, the HSE is looking at retrofitting existing commercial space, which was the approach used in Tallaght. I am very interested in the approach the NHS has used. It has modular builds and I believe it has put 140 of these in place across the UK. I can confirm that HSE staff were in England earlier this week meeting with the NHS on exactly that. Obviously the facilities have to be high quality and clinically sound. The priority is picking an approach that gets these facilities in place as quickly as possible.

This week, in Westmeath, our director of planning described staffing levels as the equivalent of a revolving door syndrome. At the same time, there has been a massive increase in complaints around unauthorised developments. This has the makings of an unmitigated disaster. Apparently, there are local authorities that do not have even one single planning enforcement officer. I have two questions. Which city and county councils have no full-time planning enforcement officers? Can the Taoiseach advise if the reported request from city and county councils for additional funding from Government for the hiring of 541 planning staff will be approved?

Our planning enforcement sections need to be properly staffed as well.

It is the best January on record and is a 9% jump on this time last year. Predominantly offshore wind energy generated 1,479 GW of electricity which is equivalent to the consumption of 320,000 Irish homes. The wind energy potential of Ireland provides us with a huge opportunity but we are in a race with other countries to secure material supply routes among other things. The development of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, is crucial for our ability to scale up our offshore wind offering. The State has a commitment to get MARA up and running in 2023. I ask the Taoiseach to provide an update on the development of MARA. When will it begin its vital work?

I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Government, voluntary organisations and the general public for the massive outpouring of goodwill and generosity they are affording them. I thank the Taoiseach sincerely for his own reaction to this awful event. Today we have seen heartbreaking pictures, including a father with his recently deceased daughter in the middle of the rubble. It was truly heartbreaking to see these photographs and everybody will acknowledge this. Very briefly I want to raise the issue of an alliance of small nursing homes that has approached me. It comprises 27 nursing homes. They are in rural communities. Six nursing homes have said that they really cannot see how they will be able to financially continue beyond July unless there is an immediate increase in their National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, rates. They are not part of Nursing Homes Ireland. They are smaller nursing homes which, as the Taoiseach knows, provide a great service in our communities.

The Government is aware there have been issues in terms of the rates set under the NTPF-administered scheme and the fact that costs have been rising.

I can tell Deputy Healy-Rae the Minister of State is engaged and she and the Department are working with the NTPF to see what might be done to recognise this.

The death toll has risen to 11,000 and the World Health Organization has warned that it could rise to 20,000. I want to raise the question of aid to this very desperate area in this desperate scenario. Aid has always been weaponised and there have been sanctions in place against Syria. These are sanctions by the EU and the US. I am no friend of Assad or the Syrian regime and what it has done, which has been absolutely outrageous in that country for the past 11 or 12 years, but obstacles are there to humanitarian aid and they have already prevented the importation of many medicines into the country. GoFundMe is stating it cannot allow funding support into Syria even though some people in some cases are trying to raise it through this manner. Will the Taoiseach assure us that Ireland will use its voice to insist the EU and countries globally do not allow sanctions against Syria to impact on the humanitarian effort to rescue people, save lives and re-establish some sense of order in the region?

Most of it will go to Syria and it will be done through the UN, the Red Cross and Red Crescent. We are going to talk to the authorities and see what else we can do. I expect this will be a matter we will discuss at the European Council tomorrow and I agree with the fundamental case the Deputy is making. I have always taken the view food and medicine should be exempt from sanctions. They are exempt from the sanctions regime imposed on Russia at the moment. I do not know how exactly that affects Syria but I will find out and make it part of our discussions tomorrow at the Council.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	112	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 to provide for abortion on request prior to foetal viability; to abolish the 3 day waiting period for abortion on request; to allow for abortion on grounds of fatal foetal abnormality that are likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within a year of birth; to allow for abortion where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; and to decriminalise the provision of abortion.In moving this Bill, I remember those cases that propelled many people in this country into action and into campaigning and fighting for the right to chose. Savita Halappanavar and Ms X are just two in a litany of names and initials who became synonymous with a cruel and punishing Ireland for women. In recent weeks we have seen protests targeting refugee centres, ostensibly under the banner of defending women and safeguarding them from some unknown threat. It is ironic that in most cases these protests have been led and orchestrated by men who fought tooth and nail against repeal and against giving women the right to choose and to control their own reproductive health. This Bill, like the Repeal movement, insists abortion is a health issue. It supports the belief held by the vast majority in the country that someone who needs abortion care should never have to travel abroad for it. In line with the beliefs of the majority, it aims to ensure abortion is treated like any other medical procedure and is never a matter for criminal law. It aims to achieve full decriminalisation of abortion in line with WHO guidelines. It will see the removal of the mandatory three-day waiting period and the 12-week gestational limit. Abortion is a health issue for women and the insertion of the three-day waiting period tells women their decision to do what they want with their own bodies must be questioned; that the healthcare they are seeking access to is somehow different from care for other aspects of their health and that we are going to place obstacles and hurdles in their way. It suggests there is something wrong with their choice. We totally reject this and the burden it places on women. In many places in the country, accessing abortion care or seeing a GP who will treat you is very difficult, if not impossible. When you get an appointment, take time off work and travel, you then have to go away, think about it, consider your choice and make your way back again for the treatment you are entitled to. This Bill rejects that continuing heartbreak and trauma. We are putting women through it in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities as well. Out of every five women who need abortion care in cases of foetal anomaly, two must travel. Research has shown that in the two weeks before the close of the public consultation, 71% of people agreed abortion should be treated like any other medical procedure and should never be a matter for criminal law and the chill factor that surrounds the laws we have. Research has also shown it is critical the Government listens to the lived experience of women accessing abortion care and recognises the barriers we put in front of them and takes forward evidence and recommendations from people. There is no medical evidence to support the three-day waiting period. It was not recommended by the citizens' assembly or the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. It was inserted by the Cabinet and the overwhelming majority of people who must wait the three days found it added stress and anxiety to their physical and mental health. They described the wait as ridiculous, patronising, unnecessary and demeaning. My last point relates to the issue of fatal foetal anomaly. It is heartbreaking to see hundreds of women having to travel to Britain since the law was introduced following repeal. In most cases they must travel because medical practitioners say they cannot be certain that within 28 days of being born a fatal abnormality will prevent that foetus from living. This Bill extends that period from 28 days to a whole year. The details are in the Bill, but to summarise, it will provide abortion on request for fatal foetal anomaly, abolish the three-day waiting period and provide abortion on the grounds that are likely to lead to the death of a foetus either before or within a year. It will also allow for abortion where there is a risk to the life or the health of a woman or pregnant person and entirely decriminalise the provision of abortion. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to cross-party support. I have a final point on the review of the abortion legislation, which is long overdue. I am sorry the Minister for Health has left the Chamber. The review of the abortion legislation should have been submitted to him by yesterday. He has given us no timeline for the publication of his report on same. I have asked a parliamentary question on this and would like the Minister to finally give us a straight and sincere answer about when we can expect this review.

This Bill is designed to protect Garda members and fire service, emergency service and healthcare workers in the line of duty.This Aontú Bill provides for a minimum custodial sentence for someone who physically assaults a garda, a healthcare worker, or an emergency service worker while in the line of duty. In an answer to a parliamentary question Aontú posed in recent weeks, we found out that 2,411 gardaí were assaulted while on active duty in the last ten years. More than 200 gardaí every year are being assaulted while they are going about their business to ensure they protect citizens in this country. I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that is an enormously high figure. What it means is that gardaí and their families are terrified they will have a significant or serious assault meted out to them while they are working. The Government must take steps to protect gardaí while they are serving our community. In the last few weeks, and the Taoiseach will have seen it, it has been incredible that gardaí have had their hands bitten, their cars rammed, and indeed they have been beaten up by thugs on the streets who seem to act with impunity in relation to the physical damage they are doing to gardaí. One of the key elements of this is that the Government has hung the gardaí out to dry in recent years. Figures I looked at from 2016 showed that Ireland had one of the lowest numbers of police per capita in the whole of the European Union. Indeed it was 40 police officers per 100,000 less than the European average, which is extremely low. This leaves gardaí fiercely vulnerable. The latest figures I have seen show that there has hardly been a change in the number of gardaí per capita since 2016. We must remember 2016 was a low point because it was at the end of many years of Templemore being closed and many years of harsh austerity being meted out and yet here we are today in 2023, after having a surplus of €5 billion last year, in a situation where we still have one of the lowest number of police in the whole of the European Union. We see that not only are gardaí being assaulted in high numbers but an awful lot of gardaí are not resigning from the force. Another parliamentary question I submitted found out that two gardaí resign from the force every single week. Hundreds of gardaí are retiring from the force. At the same time, we ask the Government to invest in making sure we recruit more gardaí. It is incredible and the Taoiseach must have been astounded by this. Some 150 gardaí in total were recruited in 2022 which is one of the lowest figures since Templemore reopened. This is a figure that should be recruited on a monthly basis but it was the annual total for recruitment. The figures are only going one way in relation to this. One of the problems is that the Department of Justice and the Ministers who have led the Department have been really focused on Bills that are all about the culture wars and are not about the bread and butter stuff of which people living in communities, be they rural or urban, are really frightened in terms of the dangers of being assaulted, being robbed, etc. The Department and the Government need to start focusing on these issues again because they are real issues. There is hardly a town in the country that does not have a problem with drugs being sold in its main square. There are serious difficulties getting the gardaí out onto the beat on the streets because of the lack of numbers we currently have. There are crises in the Garda at the moment and one crisis is that gardaí are being left incredibly vulnerable to assault and to attack. Our Bill very simply states that if a person assaults a garda physically, there will be a minimum custodial sentence for the person who carried it out. It also seeks to cover workers who work in the fire brigade, ambulance personnel, and health service workers. Front-line staff in the Ireland East Hospital Group reported 3,500 assaults while working in hospitals in a seven-year period. The Taoiseach has worked in hospitals and knows these people should be protected while they are protecting the lives of other people. I urge the Government to get behind this Bill and to make sure it passes all Stages as soon as possible.

The Department of the Taoiseach, in line with the rest of the Civil Service, actively encourages equality, diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunities for all staff and recognises that a diverse workforce helped by an inclusive culture can improve organisational capacity, boosting creativity and innovation and lead to better decision-making. The 2022 gender pay gap report for the Department of the Taoiseach was published on 23 December 2022. The report sets out the gender pay gap statistics, incorporating 240 staff employed during the reporting period which was from July 2021 to June 2022. The information in the report was calculated in accordance with the principles laid out in the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021, which required organisations to report on their gender pay gap, that is, the difference between the average hourly wage of men and women across the workforce. For 2022, the Department's gender pay gap was 8.82% in favour of male employees. This means that the average hourly rate of pay for male employees was 8.82% higher than the average hourly rate for female employees during the relevant pay period. The latest EUROSTAT figures show the latest gender pay gap for Ireland is 11.3% and an EU wide average of 13%. Ireland is doing better than the EU average and the Department of the Taoiseach is doing better than Ireland but there still is a gender pay gap we need to close. The Department's current gender distribution is 60.2% female and 39.8% male. This includes a significant level of female staff in middle management positions and a balanced gender distribution at principal officer and management board level. All employees are aligned to published civil and public service pay scales. This ensures equal pay for the same work irrespective of gender, with incremental progression based on years of service and satisfactory performance. Publishing the Department's gender pay gap data helps the Department to bring a specific focus on gender diversity and to continue the alignment of our actions for improvement in gender equality as part of the broader work to enhance equality, diversity and inclusion across the Department. The Department of the Taoiseach will also continue to review its actions to improve gender equality to smooth career progression and promotion of more women to senior positions. The Department also offers a range of flexible working arrangements to all staff, including shorter working weeks and blended working arrangements and offers additional assistance to all staff in career development and to pursue promotional opportunities throughout their employment journey. Recruitment to the Department is mainly through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, which plays a central role in recruiting diverse talent in line with its own equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, strategy. While equal pay and equal opportunity are cornerstones of employment in the Civil Service, there is clearly more work to do to eliminate gender inequality not just in the workplace but right across our society. Government is showing leadership in this area, building on the extensive programme of work initiated when I first took up the office of Taoiseach, including the gender pay gap legislation, which is now the law, funding additional parental leave, reducing the cost of childcare, ensuring better gender balance on company boards as well as State boards and increasing gender candidate quotas for Dáil elections, which take effect this year.

However, an 11.2% average nationally is still not good enough.Women earning less than men in comparable jobs is something that should be confined to the history books and should not be the current situation in the 21st century. It is also worth noting that there is a gender pension gap and that the Joint Committee on Social Protection heard that women retire earning 35% less than their male counterparts. The proposed auto-enrolment plan will do nothing to address this point. Here is an issue that has an impact into retirement and beyond working lives and about which the Government could do something by bringing in social protection measures to address this income gap. It is not a mystery or unexplained why it is that women suffer lower pay than men. It is overwhelmingly because they are employed in professions and sectors that involve child-rearing duties or teaching, and this impacts on how and where they can work. With the general relegation of caring, nursing and teaching and in the sorts of professions in society, in hospitality and in retail that are often dominated by women, we find high levels of precarious work and low levels of pay. While we welcome the statutory rule that employers must report the gap, we need much more than reporting to address this issue.

I wish to raise a related matter with the Taoiseach, if I can. It is the domestic violence leave reduced rate of pay provision that is contained within the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022. The legislation, as the Taoiseach knows, enables the Minister to make regulations to prescribe "the daily rate of domestic violence leave pay". The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has indicated he is considering pay parity with sick pay as against full pay. Applying a reduced pay rate in this instance is just wrong. Women's Aid strongly believes domestic violence leave should instead be paid in full at a person's normal rate of pay, and I agree with that. The Taoiseach himself has acknowledged we are experiencing an epidemic of domestic violence and violence against women in particular. Penalising victims of domestic violence with a cut of up to 30% in their pay will cause immense hardship and, worse again, will potentially be a safety risk because, where a victim's payslips or bank accounts are monitored, any change in pay will alert an abuser that she has not attended work as usual. This level of control is more prevalent than we might imagine and should not be dismissed by the Minister. I am asking, therefore, that we follow international best practice from places like New Zealand, Italy and Australia and have domestic violence pay leave be paid in full. Will the Taoiseach intervene on this matter?

At the current rate, it will take 257 years to close this gap fully. In his contribution at the start, the Taoiseach said a gender pay gap in Ireland of 11.2% compared with an EU average of 13% showed this State was doing better. I put it to the Taoiseach that a better way to phrase that would be to say that in this country we are doing less badly than the EU. There should be no pats on the back here. There is a long way to go. In this country, a key contributor to the gap is the State's grossly inadequate and expensive system of childcare, which forces many women to take a longer break from work than they would like. Whereas in Germany a household spends on average of 1% of its net household income on childcare, and 3% in Austria and 5% in Sweden, in Ireland the equivalent figure is a whopping 28%. The Government is currently putting more money into a childcare system that is run, in large measure, by the private sector.

They represented people who previously might have been categorised as cleaners in hospitals and they came from University Hospital Limerick, Cork University Hospital and Letterkenny hospital. What I learned was very interesting. As one woman put it, when she first became a cleaner 18 years ago, she was given a cloth, a bucket and mop.

It has become a seriously skilled job, particularly after Covid-19 and especially concerning the whole question of infection control. If we do not have people cleaning places properly and who know how to do it in a professional way, then we will not have safe hospitals. These people had an evaluation done of their jobs. Other grades were given a new categorisation and, as a result, pay increases because there was a recognition their jobs had changed and they should be valued more differently.

It is also, though, very important for mothers and fathers to have access to work and income. The sector has been in crisis for many years. Under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, there has been welcome investment in recent times which has helped to reduce the costs to parents somewhat. Much damage has been done, however, especially to the early childhoold care and education, ECCE, sector, and this has seen hundreds of businesses close, especially in small towns, making it more difficult for mothers and fathers to find places for their children. Information I received today indicates there are many workers in the childcare services sector, especially those services that receive core funding, who are not qualified. I understand this is against the law. I also understand it is against the provisions of insurance coverage. I understand it is the job of Tusla and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to make sure this is not happening. Will the Taoiseach talk to the Minister and see why he is funding services that are employing staff who are not qualified in terms of childcare and to ensure this does not happen in future?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	140	As I mentioned, Ireland's pay gap is 11.3%, which is a narrower pay gap than the EU average. I am happy to say this is less bad and not better than, if Deputies prefer. It would be in line with some of the Nordic countries, which are often held up as examples for us to follow in terms of gender pay. My view is there should be no gender pay gap at all. The objective, therefore, must be 0%, or at least as close to statistical 0% as can be achieved. This will take some time. Very often, many factors are at play. Among these is not enough women being in senior positions. It is only as these vacancies arise that more women can be promoted into these senior positions. There is also a whole issue around increments. Men may be in employment for longer and have built up increments over time that give them higher pay for the same work. I do not think anyone in this House would propose that we remove increments to achieve gender equality, however. In terms of the gender pay gap, there is a difference between the State pension and occupational pensions. I do not know what the gender pay gap is for the State pension, but I think it is much smaller than is the case for occupational pensions. Occupational pensions are related to the number of years people work and the amount they pay in. As more women enter the workforce and get better paid jobs and as we introduce auto-enrolment, I believe we will see this situation improve. It is fundamentally linked to the amounts people pay in. This is how that pension system works and that is fair. Childcare is very expensive in Ireland. It is the objective of the Government to reduce the cost of childcare and early education for parents and to improve the quality of it. We have taken a big step forward in recent weeks by reducing the cost of childcare by 20% to 25%, which I think is significant. We want to reduce it further in 2024, subject to the public finances allowing this.That can make a big difference in both reducing the cost of living for families and making it easier for parents, usually but not always women, to re-enter the workforce sooner than they otherwise would, if that is their choice. However, it is never as simple as just childcare. I think I remember reading of one of the Nordic countries - it might have been Denmark, Sweden or Norway - which has a public model of childcare and has very inexpensive childcare, and it actually has the same gender pay gap as we do or possibly a bigger one. We need to bear in mind that many factors are at play. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is introducing plans for paid leave for victims of domestic violence. This is a new form of leave and a significant step forward. We need to take into account that it will be an additional cost on employers, including very small businesses that might only have one or two staff and businesses along the Border which we always need to bear in mind because successive administrations north of the Border have failed to keep up with us in terms of workers' rights. That in turn holds us back because we need to have regard to the failure successive administrations in Northern Ireland to keep up with those when it comes to workers' rights and the impact that then has on small businesses on our side of the Border, for example. Deputies will be aware of many proposals for new forms of leave, which we need to consider in the round. Childcare staff not being properly qualified is a matter for Tusla, but I will certainly inform the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, that Deputy Tóibín raised it in the Dáil today. I broadly agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett's analysis of cleaners. Being a cleaner is increasingly a skilled job, more so than it was in the past and increasingly so in a healthcare setting where there are blood spills, personal protective equipment, PPE, and a need for infection control. There is an employment regulation order for contract cleaners. I am not sure if that applies to the group the Deputy is talking about. I have not seen the evaluation report but I will make some further inquiries about it.

Government has been working to implement the commitments in the programme for Government, which are advanced through the co-ordinating mechanisms of the Cabinet committee structure. The ten Cabinet committees recently established by Government reflect the core policy areas set out in the programme for Government on which it will continue to focus. Cabinet committees will meet regularly to accomplish their work. Strategy statements, currently being prepared by all Departments, will reflect the national priorities outlined in the programme for Government. The Department of the Taoiseach continues to help advance the programme for Government commitments in the following priority policy areas: implementation of the Housing for All strategy, which is driving delivery of crucial housing-related commitments; the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the publication of the Climate Action Plan 2023, the launch of the national retrofit plan, adoption of the carbon budget programme and agreement of the sectoral emissions ceilings; advancements in Sláintecare, the health reform programme, such as an implementation plan for regional health areas and the publication shortly of the Sláintecare progress report for 2022 and the 2023 action plan for Sláintecare; ongoing oversight of implementation of the third domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy; the ongoing development of the well-being framework for Ireland; publication of a report in June, detailing significant progress achieved under the 2021 economic recovery plan, which focused on driving a jobs-rich recovery and encouraging the transition towards a decarbonised and digital economy; driving the implementation of our commitments on a shared island, through the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach; driving implementation of the New Decade, New Approach commitments, in conjunction with Departments North and South; strengthening British-Irish relations, including with London and the devolved governments; ongoing engagement with EU leaders to advance high-level objectives in the programme for Government, in particular, energy security, Brexit, economic issues and external relations, as well as pursuing a strong, collective response to Russia's war on Ukraine; ongoing oversight of the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future - the Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland; progressing citizens' assemblies, with the Dublin-related citizens' assembly having submitted its report to the Oireachtas in December and the biodiversity loss assembly following suit shortly, with two further citizens' assemblies, one dealing with matters relating to drug use and the other on the future of education, under consideration, which will be subject to Oireachtas agreement; and the publication of the Future of Media Commission report and the Government's response, which constitutes a strategic programme of work for public service content across media in Ireland. Work to implement the report's recommendations and develop a new funding model is under way.

That is why, on 18 February, we need to get out on the Ireland for All demonstration which has been widely backed by trade union and community groups, anti-poverty groups, housing groups and many others. Simultaneously, we need emergency measures to address the spiralling housing and homelessness crisis. Will the Taoiseach take a few emergency measures in that regard? The Government needs to start treating it as an emergency. A cliff edge is coming with the end of the moratorium on evictions. Even the Government's own estimates reckon that 3,000 people could be homeless if that moratorium were not in place. That moratorium is not fully covering many people. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to announce clearly that it will not allow more people be evicted into homelessness.

In recent weeks we have seen a dramatic escalation of violence against migrants in Dublin in particular. On Saturday, 28 January, homeless migrant men were attacked with dogs, sticks and a baseball bat at Ashtown. On Monday, 30 January, a building in Sheriff Street burned down seemingly because it was wrongly suspected of being planned for use by asylum seekers. On 1 February, footage emerged of someone attempting to drive over a pedestrian after asking them, "Are you an immigrant?" On Thursday, 2 February a group of international students were racially abused and physically attacked at the Broadstone Technological University Dublin Luas stop. The vast majority of people abhor this and abhor seeing protests outside vulnerable people's temporary inadequate accommodation. That is the reason thousands will be on the streets on 18 February. The Taoiseach said earlier we should not give any succour to racist arguments and I agree. Does he agree therefore that he should stop the discrimination against migrants and against asylum seekers from countries other than Ukraine? We should not be putting them on the street with a Dunnes Stores voucher and €5 in phone credit.

To counter this, we need at least 10,000 affordable homes each year. In the first three quarters of last year, fewer than 1,000 affordable and cost rental homes were delivered. At the same time, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is returning hundreds of millions of euro unspent to the central Exchequer. This money could be used to build much-needed affordable homes. Given the scale and depth of the housing crisis, why are hundreds of millions of euro, which could be used to build homes, being returned to the central Exchequer?

How will nursing home deaths be dealt with? I encourage the Taoiseach to meet families whose loved ones died during the pandemic. These include families from Dealgan House or Ballynoe nursing home in Whites Cross. They will tell a story of systemic institutional failure that resulted in an absence of oversight, governance, accountability and training, and inadequate staff ratios. Care Champions has catalogued the families' experiences and I strongly urge the Taoiseach to hear of them and from them. More than 3,000 submissions of concern were made to HIQA between 2020 and 2022 regarding nursing homes. These failures continue as families are still being refused access to their parents' or their partners' nursing home records, which is inexplicable to me. Does the Taoiseach agree these records should be released? Will he meet representatives of Care Champions and the bereaved families to better understand why a public inquiry into nursing home deaths during the Covid pandemic is absolutely needed?

Let us be clear: litigation by the Government against vulnerable people is a political choice. The Government also has a responsibility to do right by citizens. The truth of the matter is that, right now, most people, when in battle with the State, have to fight tooth and nail for justice, and many have to fight right up until their death to receive justice. Some people even have to fight among the debris of their shattered lives simply to get justice. Today, we in Aontú found out that 44 families are now engaged in legal action against the Government on the circumstances of their loved ones who died in nursing homes or hospitals during the Covid-19 crisis. We in Aontú have put forward a Bill which would provide for an investigation into their experiences. The Government has refused to back that Bill and has so far refused to carry out an independent investigation itself. We are now seeing the floodgates open where people are forced to go to court to get justice for their families. Will the Taoiseach commit to a proper, full and independent investigation in respect of how people were treated in nursing homes and hospitals?

The Taoiseach will be aware of one of our most successful sporting teams, the Leinster Rugby team, which, as the Taoiseach knows, plays its matches at home in the RDS. I know the Taoiseach has been there recently and he will no doubt be aware the condition of it is very poor. The grandstand there, or rather the Anglesea Stand, was constructed back in 1927. The ground needs to be refurbished. The RDS, which provides a broad service throughout the city and country for all types of different events, is seeking some State support. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that there will be some Government funding available to refurbish the main arena at the RDS?

It must now be added to a list that includes the CervicalCheck women, the hepatitis C women, the denial of disability payments for those in long-term care, the denial of redress to a large cohort of mother and baby homes survivors, and many others. The Attorney General’s report defends a policy that was cold, callous and calculated. I see the leader the Labour Party is calling for a redress scheme. I support that call, but is it not unfortunate that the Labour Party did not support such a call when it held the position of Minister for Health, under Deputy Howlin, and instead implemented the no-payment policy against the vulnerable people? Why would the Taoiseach be opposed to redress?

Given the significant increase in applications over the past 12 months, it is clear the Immigration Service Delivery, the International Protection Office and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, will need extra resources. For example, I understand that IPAT fees to barristers determining the appeals have not changed since 2011 and this may have an impact on recruiting sufficiently qualified personnel for that. Will the Taoiseach advise what measures are being taken to support these institutions which are responsible for determining these cases?

We will need to ensure we are properly staffed to make decisions quickly and to enforce them. On the question raised by Deputy Jim O’Callaghan, I put on record my strong support for the RDS project. I am a big supporter of it and have met with the RDS. It has planning permission and is ready to go quite soon. I would like to see it go to tender this year. State funding has already been committed but I understand that, because of the increase in building costs, the RDS is looking for additional State funding, and it is not the only such body in that boat. We need to look at that in the round and there are other sporting projects that also need to be considered. I would also say that it will not just be of benefit to Leinster Rugby but will also be a centre for women’s sport, which gives us an added value.  On the Covid-19 inquiry, this is being scoped out. It will be wider than just the health response and will take into account the economic and other responses. We hope to have it established by mid-year and we will be guided by what they are doing in other countries. They have different legal systems but they have also set up inquiries, and it is right that is done. We intend that it will also examine how nursing homes handled Covid-19. We also need to be fair to the management and staff of nursing homes. This was an unprecedented event in our lifetimes with a pandemic and a new virus. I do not think anyone had a manual or roadmap as to how it could be best managed. It is an area we will inquire into.

We made significant progress in the past year, where more than 16,000 people, couples and families bought their first home. That is the highest figure we have had in 15 years, and we have to go back to the Celtic tiger era to find an era when so many people bought their first home. We have a long way to go yet and there needs to be a great deal more than that done. In respect of the underspend in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I am not aware how much that underspend will be yet, incidentally, but it will be much less than some of the figures that have been aired publicly. There are two reasons it has occurred. One is the record resources and the amount of money that has been given to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which has increased dramatically in recent years because of our commitment to solving the housing crisis. When spending is ramped up rapidly, it can be difficult sometimes to spend it, if, of course, it is being spent correctly. There are constraints in respect of the availability of staff, skilled labour and materials. All of those things can also create difficulties. On the wider issue of housing, we have already taken many emergency measures on housing, whether they are the rent pressure zones, the eviction ban, the fund for compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, or fast-track planning legislation, and we will always consider further emergency actions that might help with the situation. We always have to remember the unintended consequences. I am aware the Deputy mentioned that the eviction ban is not working fully. The ban is also harming some people. We have both read and heard stories and have even met people who went abroad for six months or for a year and who now cannot move back into their own home. That is also a problem.

The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, advises me on strategic policy issues relating to sustainable economic, social and environmental development in Ireland. The NESC work programme currently includes six main areas, which are as follows. The first is housing, land and sustainable development. In 2022, the council discussed housing at its June and September meetings. These discussions led to a focused council report on the role of private rental accommodation as part of an effective housing system. This report, Private Rental in Ireland, is with me at the moment and will be submitted to Government in the coming weeks. The second area is the economy. The council is finalising work that focuses on the nature of the Irish economy, its underlying strengths and areas of vulnerability. It is expected that the final council report will be submitted to the Government in the first quarter of this year. The third area is climate action, just transition and agriculture. This work is exploring, in practical terms, how climate targets and the transition they entail for Irish agriculture can be achieved in a manner that encompasses social equity and inclusion, environmental resilience and economic well-being. A final council report will be prepared in the second quarter of 2023. Shared island is the next area. NESC will continue to engage with the shared island unit, and this work will include a focus on social enterprise in 2023. A report will be discussed at the NESC council meeting in March 2023. In the good jobs area, NESC will engage with relevant stakeholders to help provide a basis for work in essential sectors of the economy in which an emphasis on good jobs could provide a mechanism for improving worker well-being, driving innovation and enhancing productivity. The final area is inequality and well-being. This work by NESC will deepen the understanding of inequality in Ireland and will consider how Ireland’s well-being framework can help identify inequalities and how it can point towards new means of confronting such inequalities. The NESC-published reports can be found on its website. As reports are finalised in the relevant areas, they are brought to the Government for discussion and noting in advance of publication.

I put it to him that almost everything has changed since some of those reports were done. There needs to be a sort of an emergency response, again, to the shocking levels of poverty that are now becoming apparent. The Barnardos report published today is really shocking. The number of people accessing food banks has doubled to one in ten of the population. The number that has difficulty putting food on the table for their family is now one in five. This is one of the richest countries in the world. According to a report yesterday, the food inflation rate has gone up to 16% in the 12 weeks until the middle of January. As we speak, people are being driven into poverty. There has to be some awareness. At the time of the budget, we predicted, I hate to say, that the budget increases in social welfare, wages, pensions and so on would leave people in a worse situation and would leave more people driven into poverty. It is now happening. There has to be a response. We need an emergency budget. We cannot have tens of thousands of people, especially vulnerable people and children, without enough food to eat and turning off the heating because they cannot afford it. We cannot have that. It is especially nauseating that a few weeks ago, there was a report about the number of people who have more than €4 million in personal wealth having doubled in the country. We have to do something about this inequality. An emergency response is needed. We need an emergency budget and further emergency measures on the cost-of-living crisis.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	158	Is the Taoiseach ashamed to lead a Government in one of the richest countries in the world and yet have a situation where one in ten parents are forced to go to food banks or rely on food donations to be able to feed their children? It is an incredible indictment of what is happening in this country and the policies of the Government. We know that the price of groceries has increased in the course of the past year by more than 16%, obviously far outstripping any meagre wage increases people are getting or meagre increases in social welfare payments. We also know that last year food companies, globally, and the same goes for Ireland, doubled their profits. There is a relationship between those two things. The driving factor behind the very high increases in food prices is incredible profiteering by the food companies. We clearly need an increase in people's wages. We need an increase in social welfare payments. However, I ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees the Government should use the power it has under consumer protection legislation to introduce price controls on key food items. I draw the attention of the Taoiseach to his sister party in Greece, New Democracy, which is in government. It has introduced a list of 50 basic goods on which supermarkets are expected to freeze prices or scale back future increases. Does the Taoiseach not agree we need price controls in this country?

I will put on the record that north of the Border, there is an entitlement to ten days of leave on full pay. I reiterate my call to the Taoiseach to go back to the Minister and to ensure that domestic violence leave is at full pay. I will raise the NESC findings from focus group work undertaken in the north west. Not surprisingly, the region's historically poor transport connectivity loomed large. There is no motorway, direct rail or air route from Dublin to Derry. Bear in mind Derry is the fourth-largest city in Ireland. An air connectivity review is committed to under the New Decade, New Approach agreement, which includes the Dublin-Derry route. Following a meeting with the cross-party delegation of councillors from Donegal, Derry and Strabane last year, the then Taoiseach indicated he was open to Government funding of Derry airport. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport subsequently met the board of management of City of Derry Airport. Reopening the Dublin-Derry air route would create enormous economic and social opportunities for the north west. When can we expect the Minister for Transport to conclude his consideration of the data provided by Derry airport management? When will the air connectivity review be completed and published?

This is the wrong decision. It means that many people, especially older people who cannot buy GAA tickets online or use technology are effectively banned from matches. I know of older people who have gone to matches. They have not been able to procure a ticket and they have had to go home. The GAA is a wonderful organisation. It is the most successful community organisation in the country. That is why it is disappointing to see this policy being introduced. The policy is excluding people. It is hitting the people who have been isolated the most during the Covid crisis. Age NI has come out to publicly pronounce against this policy. AIB was forced to reverse its policy when it started to get rid of cash, especially in rural branches. Aontú is campaigning, North and South, for the re-introduction of cash in at least one turnstile at each match. Will the Taoiseach join with us and ask the GAA to be more inclusive in terms of access to GAA matches?

I hope the Taoiseach can take on board what I suggested at the time, in the context of discussions he said would be taking place in March between the shared island unit and NESC, that a particular work project should be undertaken on the specific challenges faced by the Border region, especially the central Border area of Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Armagh and Tyrone. As the Taoiseach knows, that region is very dependent on the agrifood, engineering and construction product sectors. Our key market is Britain. All of the issues with regard to Brexit and the protocol are not yet resolved. We sincerely hope they will be but any disruption to trade has a major impact on businesses in our region, both North and South of the Border. NESC should devote a particular part of its work to the challenges facing that central Border area because as we all know, the more highly-developed and concentrated areas such as the east coast, Dublin-Belfast axis will weather economic storms. Our region is not as well prepared or well resourced to weather economic storms that can arise through international turbulence or through turbulence between the European Union and Britain. It is very important that we prepare for any eventualities that might impact on the economy in that region, both North and South.

On the inquiry into how the State dealt with Covid, the Taoiseach is talking about it being scoped out. Would it be possible to get a timeline on how long this scoping exercise will take? Can we get the detail as soon as possible about the remit and whether we are talking about individual modules, as well as a timeline on the inquiry? I spoke to the Taoiseach previously about Dealgan House and the 23 people who died there. The fact RCSI Hospitals Group took over there makes it different. The families have been promised by Ministers that a mechanism will be provided to provide answers and closure. We need to ensure this happens.

We hope to have it established by the Oireachtas mid-year. It will not just be about the State's response; it will be about the wider response from all society, including the private sector. It is impossible to put a timeframe on it but given the scope and scale, it could take a long time. That is the truth of it. I cannot possibly put a time on it. With regard to the first matter raised, it is important and was not acknowledged in the questions that poverty had been trending downwards in Ireland for a number of years, as had income inequality. Ireland, as judged by the Gini coefficient, is one of the few countries that has not seen inequality increase in recent years. That should be acknowledged and it is largely down to the policies pursued by Government in recent years. However, the cost-of-living crisis changes thing and it has caused a considerable set-back. I acknowledge that many families are really struggling to make ends meet and to pay for very basic things, whether it is energy, fuel or food. We are taking a lot of action. There have been wage increases, with the national minimum wage rising by 7.8%. That kicked in in the last few weeks and is in line with inflation. We are now likely to see inflation of less than 7.8% this year. It might not have been in line with inflation last year but if one takes inflation over a three, five or ten year period, the national minimum wage has increased ahead of the rate of inflation and ahead of the cost of living. We had the public sector pay deal as well and we have increases coming through by way of employment regulation orders and across the private sector pay increases are happening as well. We have pension and welfare increases which just kicked in in the last few weeks, amounting to an extra €12 per week. There have been more targeted measures like the extension of the fuel allowance to tens of thousands more people. There have been income tax reductions, including the rent credit which I know will be welcomed by a lot of renters. We are taking action on the social wage by reducing the cost of public transport, school transport, childcare, college fees, and providing free schoolbooks. All of these things make a big difference.

Research by the ESRI and others has shown that for a lot of people, these measures largely or fully insulate them from the cost-of-living crisis but I absolutely acknowledge that is not the case for everyone. Certainly when it comes to deciding what we do in the March, April and May period, we will have regard to the fact that we need to target those who are suffering the most. To be very frank, I do not think price controls are a good idea. They have been used in the past in Ireland but they did not work very well. While the Government can cap what retailers can charge for a certain product, it cannot cap what the retailer has to pay to get that product. Where price controls and price caps are introduced, it often leads to shortages. We might find, if we introduced a price cap of 120 cent per litre for petrol or diesel, for example, that we just have no petrol or diesel because there is no margin there for the retailer. That is often one of the problems with price controls. Another problem which we saw play out in the UK when it introduced energy price caps was that the Government just had to keep increasing the caps because the wholesale cost of energy kept going up.

The same also applies to the minimum wage, for example.

Decisions on ticketing are ultimately a matter for the organisations concerned but there should be some provision for cash. One of the issues that came out of the report on the retail banking sector, led by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was that while we do want to have electronic payments and make them the norm, and they are the norm now, cash is still legal tender and we should make some provision for the use of cash. That said, I do not understand the practicalities of having one turnstile that accepts cash. I just do not know enough about it to make a judgment on it.

Several matters are being added to the Long Title. While I will speak to each area in more detail as the amendments arise, I will give a brief explanation now. Deputies will recall that the purpose of the Bill as introduced is to implement the EU framework decision 2008/909 on the mutual recognition of custodial sentences. This framework decision provides for the transfer of sentenced persons between EU member states and it supersedes the existing Council of Europe convention on the transfer of sentenced persons for transfers within the European Union. Deputies will be aware that the convention is given effect by the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 and the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Act 2005. Both of these Acts will remain in force and are particularly important as, after Brexit, transfers to and from the UK, which form the bulk of all transfers, take place under them. On Second Stage I noted that serious legal issues had arisen with convention transfers which would also have affected Ireland's implementation of the framework decision. I stated that I intended to address these issues in this Bill for both the framework decision and the convention by introducing further amendments to both regimes. That is the purpose of the majority of the amendments before the House. The Long Title already covers the provisions on early and conditional release being introduced to the framework decision regime in Part 3 of the Bill. Therefore, the amendment to the Long Title is as a consequence of amendments to the 1995 Act to give effect to similar changes on early and conditional release for the convention regime and to align the 1995 Act with Part 3 of the Bill in terms of how the transfer process works, amendments to the 2005 Act to do the same for that Act and amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 1960. These provide for a new system of conditional release which will be applicable to transfers under all three Acts. Amendments to the Parole Act 2019 to make provision in relation to how life sentences are treated will similarly be applicable to all three Acts. Finally, amendments are being proposed in relation to the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Decisions on Supervision Measures) Act 2020. These address technical transposition issues with that Act which have been raised by the European Commission in the past 12 months. For the information of Deputies as we discuss these amendments, different terminology is used in instruments in relation to the state's involved. Generally I will refer to the state where a person transfers from as the "sentencing" state and the state to which the person transfers as the "administrating" state. This is the convention terminology. The framework decision uses "issuing" state and "executing" state, in line with other EU instruments but these terms have the same meaning as "sentencing" and "administrating" state, respectively.

The transfer of persons serving custodial sentences presents inevitable challenges. States use increasingly complex sentencing structures and, in almost all cases, a sentence is no longer simply a term of years to be served in prison. Instead, sentences incorporate the possibility of accelerated release based on a range of factors. Conversely, they may provide for periods after the ordinary completion of the custodial part of the sentence where a person may be returned to prison if he or she does not abide by post-release conditions and sentences may, by design, incorporate a part served in the community. The features applicable to a sentence may be determined generally by a state's legal system or be subject to case-by-case determination by a court. The knowledge of how a sentence will be served in a particular state informs a court's decision on what is just to impose. The general approach taken in international prison transfer agreements is that the sentencing state determines the legal nature and duration of the sentence and this is binding on the administering state. The administering state may adapt the legal nature but this may not aggravate the sentence. Thereafter, the administrating state applies its own rules in how the sentence is enforced, covering remission, for example. The complexities arising are illustrated by the decision of the Supreme Court in Sweeney v. Governor of Loughan House in 2014. The court found that certain foreign provisions on conditional release, including those applying by default in the UK, should be treated as part of the legal nature of the sentence. The effect of the judgment was that typical UK sentences, which contain an automatic conditional release at the halfway point, were treated as if containing two separate elements, namely, a custodial element and a supervised release element, only the custodial element could be transferred and the person would be entitled to a unconditional release thereafter. Similar legal issues arise under the framework decision. Differences arise even with relatively simple structures. Depending on the law of the other state, a reduction for remission may be indicated and applied at the time of transfer. In other cases, the law of the other state may provide for release upon a portion of the sentence having been served but there is accrual of remission and no reduction applied on transfer. The conditional release may be presumptive rather than automatic. Given that EU case law suggests Irish remission cannot be applied to the part of a sentence served in the other state pre-transfer, Irish remission only applies to the balance of the sentence remaining to be served. If no account is taken of the other state's conditional release mechanism, a sentenced person may face a significantly increased de facto
time in custody arising from the loss of benefit from conditional release on the part served pre-transfer. There are no straightforward solutions to these difficulties. Legislation cannot account for every possible sentence structure that might arise in another state now and in the future. What is necessary is a flexible mechanism that ensures that both the courts and the Minister have appropriate powers to deal with a range of sentence types. This is what is being introduced. The starting point is amendment No. 8, which amends the definition of "sentence" to expressly include parts of the sentence which may have been served otherwise than in custody. Therefore, a new power to grant conditional release is provided for under amendment No. 58. This power allows the Minister to take into account the conditional release provisions applying to the sentence before transfer to avoid a loss of benefit arising. The period of conditional release will usually be calculated on a pro rata basis. A benefit from the other state's system would be given on the part of the sentence served in that state, with Irish remission applying to the parts served in Ireland. If a remission-based system applies in the other state and a deduction has already been made on transfer, further conditional release will not be granted. With these measures in place, the question becomes which parts of the sentence form the legal nature and duration and which parts form the administration of the sentence. In general, measures in respect of early and conditional release will form part of the administration of the sentence and will not be binding. This reflects well-established international practice and is made clear in Article 17 of the framework decision. Section 43(7) as amended makes clear that the conditional release measures are considered part of the administration and enforcement of the sentence rather than going to the legal nature of the sentence, even where those conditional release measures are automatic and arise by operation of law. Section 42(8) makes a similar provision in respect of measures determining parole eligibility for life sentences. A minimum custodial period, be it a general provision in respect of all life sentences or a tariff imposed in specific cases, will not be part of the legal nature of the sentence. A life sentence is simply a life sentence, and subject to Irish parole rules. However, amendment No. 68 to the Parole Act 2019 ensures that any such minimum periods are taken into account by the parole board. These amendments do not seek to exhaustively determine what will or will not be considered part of the legal nature of a sentence. The exact determination of what constitutes the legal nature of the sentence in any given case remains with the court. The power to adopt the legal nature of a sentence also remains with the courts and its scope is clarified by amendment No. 30. However, the effect of the other amendments is likely to be that the adaption will not typically be required solely to address or bring early and conditional release measures. Taken together, and for the majority of sentences typically encountered, the effect of the amendments will be that sentences will transfer to the State for the full period of possibility custody. Irish remission will apply to the part of the sentence served after transfer and the Minister will have the power to grant conditional release where appropriate in respect of the parts served before the transfer. Deputies will note in the definition of "sentence" in amendment No. 8 that for a part-suspended sentence, the suspended element of the sentence is excluded. This is specifically to allow the handling of such sentences using a combination of this framework decision and framework decision 2008/947, which provides for supervision and enforcement of alternative measures. Finally, I note that certain changes have been introduced in respect of the corresponding offences. These clarify the requirements and, in particular, address situations involving multiple offences.

Conditional release of persons from prisons and related matters
53. The Act of 1960 is amended by the insertion of the following sections after section 2:
"Conditional release of persons from prisons
2A. (1) Subject to subsection (2), this section applies to a person serving a foreign sentence in relation to which a release provision applies.(2) This section shall not apply to a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for life.(3) This section shall apply to a person regardless of whether the foreign sentence being served by the person was imposed prior to or after the coming into operation of section 51 of the Act of 2023.(4) Subject to subsection (6) and other than where subsection (5) applies, the Minister shall, for the purpose of avoiding the loss of benefit of the release provision referred to in subsection (1), direct that such person as is specified in the direction be released (in this Act referred to as 'conditional release') from prison for, subject to section 2B, such period, and subject to such conditions, as may be specified in the direction or rules under section 2D applying to that person.(5) This subsection applies where the Minister is of the opinion that, for reasons connected with any one or more of the following matters, it would not be appropriate to give a direction under this section:(a) the likelihood that the person would not have been released, in accordance with the release provision, from custody in the sentencing state (whether subject to conditions or otherwise) had the enforcement of the foreign sentence not transferred to the State;(b) the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates;(c) the sentence of imprisonment concerned and any recommendations of the court that imposed that sentence in relation thereto;(d) the period of the sentence of imprisonment served by the person;(e) the effect of any order adapting the sentence under section 7C(3) or (5) of the Act of 1995, 10B(3) or (5) of the Act of 2005 or 40(3) or (5) of the Act of 2023 or partial recognition and enforcement (within the meaning of Part 3 of the Act of 2023) of the sentence;(f) the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public (including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates) should the person be released from prison; (g) any offence of which the person was convicted before being convicted of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by him or her relates;(h) the risk of the person failing to return to prison upon the expiration of any period of conditional release;(i) the conduct of the person while in custody, while previously the subject of a direction under section 2 or this section or while previously released on parole (within the meaning of the Parole Act 2019);(j) any report of, or recommendation made by—(i) the governor of, or person for the time being performing the functions of governor in relation to, the prison concerned,(ii) the Garda Síochána,(iii) a probation officer,(iv) the sentencing state, or(v) any other person whom the Minister considers would be of assistance in enabling him or her to make a decision as to whether to give a direction under this section that relates to the person concerned;(k) the risk of the person committing an offence during any period of conditional release;(l) the risk of the person failing to comply with any conditions attaching to his or her conditional release;(m) the likelihood that any period of conditional release might not accelerate the person's social rehabilitation and reintegration into society or improve his or her prospects of obtaining employment.(6) The Minister shall not give a direction under this section in respect of a person—(a) to whom section 24(1)(b) of the Parole Act 2019 applies, if that person has been released on parole pursuant to a parole order (within the meaning of the Parole Act 2019), or(b) where the person has been charged with, or convicted of, an offence and is in custody pursuant to an order of a court remanding him or her to appear at a future sitting of a court.(7) The Minister shall in a timely manner decide whether to give a direction under this section.(8) Where the Minister refuses to give a direction under this section, he or she shall, unless a direction is subsequently given, review the refusal at intervals (which are not greater than 2 years).(9) A direction under this section shall be given to the governor of, or person for the time being performing the functions of governor in relation to, the prison concerned.(10) The governor of, or person for the time being performing the functions of governor in relation to, the prison concerned to whom a direction under this section is given shall comply with that direction, and shall make and keep a record in writing of that direction.(11) The giving of a direction under this section in respect of a person shall not confer an entitlement on him or her to such further direction.(12) Nothing in this section shall affect—(a) the power conferred by section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951 to commute or to remit punishment, (b) the rules or practice whereby prisoners generally may earn remission of sentence by industry and good conduct,(c) the power of the Minister to give a direction that a person be released for a temporary period under section 2 (including that section as applied by section 4 of the Prisons Act 1970),(d) the operation of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act 1998,(e) the operation of section 108 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, and(f) the operation of the Parole Act 2019 in respect of a person who is eligible for parole in accordance with section 24(1)(b) of that Act.(13) In this section, 'probation officer' means a person appointed by the Minister to be a probation officer.
Period of conditional release
2B. (1) The Minister may, in specifying a period of conditional release in a direction under section 2A, specify such period as he or she considers appropriate having regard to—(a) the purpose of avoiding the loss of the benefit of the release provision in relation to a foreign sentence being served by a person,(b) the desirability of specifying a period that is not in excess of the maximum period of release under the release provision applied pro rata to the portion of the foreign sentence served in the sentencing state, and(c) any reduction in the time to be served in prison that has already been applied in respect of the release provision upon the making of a committal order (within the meaning of the Act of 1995, the Act of 2005 or Part 3 of the Act of 2023, as the case may be) in relation to the foreign sentence.(2) The Minister may adjust, in accordance with such rules under section 2D as may apply, the period of conditional release to be specified in a direction under section 2A to avoid the accrual of both of the following benefits to the person in respect of whom the direction is to be made—(a) the calculation, after the transfer to the State of the enforcement of the foreign sentence, of the period of conditional release on the basis of the pro rata application of the release provision in relation to the foreign sentence to the portion of that sentence served in the sentencing state, and(b) the accrual to him or her while on conditional release of the benefit of the application of the rules and practice whereby prisoners generally may earn remission of sentence by industry and good conduct.
Variation of conditional release
2C. (1) The Minister may at any time vary a condition specified in a direction under section 2A whether by the alteration, addition or revocation of the condition.(2) A variation under subsection (1) by the Minister of a condition specified in a direction under section 2A shall—(a) be in writing,(b) specify the date from which the variation shall take effect,(c) include reasons for the decisions, and(d) not include, other than to the extent the Minister considers it necessary, any information that identifies, or could identify, a relevant victim or his or her place of residence.(3) Where the Minister varies a condition specified in a direction under section 2A, the variation shall—(a) take effect from the date specified, and(b) have effect from that date as a condition of the direction.
Rules relating to conditional release
2D. (1) The Minister may make rules for the purpose of enabling sections 2A, 2B and 2C to have full effect and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such rules may—(a) specify conditions to which all persons released pursuant to a direction under section 2A shall be subject or conditions to which all persons belonging to such classes of persons as are specified in the rules shall be subject,(b) for the purposes of section 2B(1)(b), specify the method to be employed for—(i) calculating a maximum period of release under a release provision, and(ii) applying the period referred to in subparagraph (i) pro rata to a portion of a foreign sentence served in the sentencing state,(c) for the purposes of section 2B(2), specify the method to be employed for calculating the adjustment (if any) of a period of conditional release for the purpose specified in that provision,(d) for the purpose of section 2C, specify the procedure for the variation of a condition specified in a direction under section 2A,and(e) contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as the Minister considers to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of enabling those sections to have full force and effect.(2) Every rule under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the rule is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the rule is laid before it, the rule shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.".
Amendment of section 4 of Act of 1960
54. Section 4 of the Act of 1960 is amended—(a) in subsection (1), by the substitution of "section 2, 2A or 3" for "section 2 or section 3",(b) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1):"(1A) Where the Minister, under section 2C(1), varies a condition specified in a direction under section 2A, he or she shall, as soon as practicable after the variation, provide a copy of the variation to the person specified in the direction.",and(c) in subsection (2), by the insertion of "or conditionally released under section 2A" after "section 3".
Amendment of section 5 of Act of 1960
55. Section 5 of the Act of 1960 is amended, by the insertion of "or conditionally released under section 2A" after "section 3".
Amendment of section 6 of Act of 1960
56. Section 6 of the Act of 1960 is amended—(a) in subsection (1)—(i) by the insertion of "or conditionally released under section 2A" after "section 3", and(ii) in paragraph (a), by the insertion of "or conditionally released, as the case may be," after "temporarily released",and(b) in subsection (3)—(i) by the substitution of "section 2, 2A or 3" for "section 2 or section 3", and(ii) by the insertion of "or conditionally released, as the case may be," after "temporarily released".".Amendment No. 58 to the Criminal Justice Act 1960 provides the legal means to effect conditional release. While modelled on the existing power to grant temporary release, it has several distinct features. The key provision is section 2A. This section applies to a person serving a foreign sentence in the State under either the convention or the framework decision. It applies only to determinate sentences to which early and conditional release provisions apply. Life sentences are dealt with in the context of the Parole Act 2019. Section 2A(4) provides that the Minister shall grant release for the purpose of avoiding a loss of benefit unless it would not be appropriate to do so. In other words, there is a presumption towards release. This presumption is subject to broad discretion to refuse to release. The factors to be considered are set out in subsection (5) and include the likelihood that a person would have been granted release in the sentencing state had the transfer not occurred. This is, of course, of particular relevance where the release would not have been automatic in the sentencing state. Other factors include any risk that a person presents to public safety, including any threat to the victim, the nature and gravity of the offence, any recommendations that may have been made by the court, the conduct of the person while in prison, and so on. These are similar to the factors that may be considered in respect of temporary release or, indeed, parole. There is a general power to set conditions. These conditions will include being of good behaviour and may be tailored to the specific circumstances of the case. As provided for in section 2B, a person will generally get the benefit of early or conditional release provisions only on pro rata basis reflecting the period served in the sentencing state as Irish remission supersedes it for the balance served in Ireland. This is not expressed as a hard limit as exceptional and unforeseen circumstances may arise with the variety of possible sentencing structures. However, the intention is that, in the vast majority of cases, the pro rata arrangement will be used. Depending on the circumstances, a release may be granted in one block or for shorter periods with a renewal to be considered when the period expires. Where the early-release provisions of the other state have already been taken into account, as where the other state operates a remission-based system and has granted a reduction at the time of transfer, a further benefit will not accrue. Irish remission, including enhanced remission rules, shall apply to the full balance of the sentence served in Ireland, but the period of the conditional release is adjusted to avoid a double benefit arising from the calculation of remission on the period of conditional release. Take the example of a person sentenced to ten years' imprisonment who would be entitled to a conditional release at the halfway point in the sentencing state
and who transfers after four years. 
Had they not transferred they would have been entitled to a release after five years. Remission applies to the six years remaining on the sentence at 25%. This would be one year and six months. Conditional release of four years would arise based on the four years served, but this is reduced by 25% to take into the account that remission applies to that period. Accordingly, the person would be eligible for a maximum of three years' conditional release. If granted, they would serve five years and six months in custody - three years on conditional release with one year and six months' remission. The Minister is required to assess whether to grant release in a timely manner. Where a release may be granted but is refused, this must be reviewed at intervals of no greater than two years. Section 2C provides for the variation of conditions. This is important in the context of conditional release compared to temporary release as it is likely that periods involved would be longer, while section 2D provides for rules to be made by the Minister to enhance the new system to have full effect. Conditions may include general conditions applicable to the persons on release, procedures involved in the variation of conditions and calculation methodologies. Section 6 provides that a person in breach of their conditional release is deemed unlawfully at large and may be arrested and returned to custody.

57. Section 8(2)(m) of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 is amended— (a) by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (ii): "(iia) any conditional release of the person under section 2A of the Act of 1960 and any conditions attached to such release which relate to the victim,", (b) by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (iii): "(iiia) without prejudice to subparagraph (iii)— (I) any application to the Minister under section 4 of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 to transfer the person out of the State in order to serve the sentence or the balance thereof in another Convention state (within the meaning of that Act) and any transfer of the person out of the State in accordance with that Act, or (II) any application within the meaning of Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences) Act 2023 and any transfer of the person to an executing state (within the meaning of that Act) in accordance with that Part,", and (c) in subparagraph (v), by the substitution of "or 3, or on conditional release under section 2A," for "or 3".". The role of victims in the outward transfer process has been important throughout the discussions on this Bill. I have indicated that we would give further consideration to any legislative provisions necessary. Deputies will recall that section 16(4) of the Bill provides for the Minister to invite or otherwise take into account submissions from any parties in determining whether to approve an outward transfer. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 contains a requirement to inform victims of any transfer of the person. However, to strengthen these provisions, I am proposing this amendment to introduce a statutory requirement to notify victims registered under the victims of crime legislation not only of a transfer but of an application for a transfer. This will enable victims, if they wish, to make submissions to the Minister in relation to the proposed transfer before a decision is made. As I mentioned, under amendment No. 59, an equivalent provision to section 64 is being added to the 1995 Act. This will clarify that the Ministers acting properly and taking into account these submissions, where appropriate. The amendment will further provide for notification of victims where conditional release is granted.

That is not appropriate and we need to ensure that will not happen in the future.

“Amendment of Parole Act 2019 
58. The Parole Act 2019 is amended— (a) in section 2— (i) in subsection (1), in the definition of “relevant governor”— (I) in paragraph (b), by the substitution of “so released,” for “so released, or”, and (II) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (b): “(ba) where the parole applicant or parolee, as the case may be, is on conditional release from prison in accordance with a direction given by the Minister under section 2A of the Act of 1960, the governor of the prison from which he or she is so released, or”, and (ii) in subsection (3)— (I) in paragraph (a)— (A) by the substitution of “including” for “including both”, (B) in subparagraph (i), by the substitution of “Act of 2001,” for “Act of 2001, and”, (C) in subparagraph (ii), by the substitution of “Act of 1960, and” for “Act of 1960,” and (D) by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (ii): “(iii) a person who is released from prison on conditional release in accordance with a direction given by the Minister under section 2A of the Act of 1960,”, and (II) in paragraph (b)— (A) in subparagraph (ii), by the substitution of “imprisonment,” for “imprisonment, and”, (B) in subparagraph (iii), by the substitution of “that Act, and” for “that Act,” and (C) by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (iii): “(iv) any time spent on conditional release from prison for a period in accordance with a direction given by the Minister under section 2A of the Act of 1960 while serving the sentence of imprisonment other than time spent on such release where the currency of the sentence of the person is suspended pursuant to section 5 of that Act,”, (b) in section 6, by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (a): “(aa) the power of the Minister to give a direction that a person be released from prison for a period under section 2A of the Act of 1960,”, and (c) in section 27— (i) in subsection (2)— (I) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (b): “(ba) without prejudice to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to (m), in the case of a foreign sentence— (i) any restriction, notified in writing to the Minister by the state in which the sentence was imposed, for the whole term of the sentence regarding the eligibility of the sentenced person to early or conditional release (including parole), (ii) any condition, notified in writing to the Minister by the state in which the sentence was imposed, that means the eligibility of the sentenced person to early or conditional release (including parole) was conditional on his or her having served a specified term of imprisonment where the condition was as a result of—(I) a decision or order by the court or tribunal that imposed the sentence, (II) the operation of law of the state in which the sentence was imposed, or (III) a decision of a body in the state in which the sentence was imposed, other than a body referred to in clause (I), on whom a power to make such a decision has been conferred by law,”, and (II) in paragraph (e)(iii), by the insertion of “or 2A” after “section 2”, and (ii) by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (3): “(4) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), a reference in that subsection to any recommendation of the court that imposed the sentence shall, in the case of a foreign sentence, be construed as a reference to any recommendation of the court or tribunal in the state that imposed the sentence. (5) In this section, ‘foreign sentence’, means— (a) a sentence of imprisonment for life, or (b) a sentence of imprisonment of a term equivalent to or longer than such term as may be prescribed in regulations made by the Minister under section 24(3), that is imposed by a court or tribunal in a state, other than the State, the enforcement of which has been transferred to the State and thereafter continued in accordance with a committal order within the meaning of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995, the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Act 2005 or Part 3 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences) Act 2023, as the case may be.”.”. The amendments to the Parole Act 2019 are the final piece in addressing the treatment of early and conditional release measures. Deputies will be aware that eligibility for parole in Ireland arises for life sentence prisoners who have served 12 years and that, on average, a person serves approximately 20 years in custody before being released. Ireland does not have a court-determined tariff system, a minimum custodial period determined on a case-by-case basis, and it is not possible to transfer in such a tariff as a binding measure. Therefore, the approach being taken is to extend the existing provision in the Act that requires the Parole Board to have regard to any recommendation of the court imposing sentence. The board will now be required to have regard to any conditions or restrictions applicable to the life sentence that would have affected a person's eligibility for parole had the transfer not occurred. The provisions of the sentencing state shall not prejudice the eligibility of the person for parole, persons shall not become eligible for parole at an earlier point than they would have in respect of an Irish sentence, and persons shall continue to be eligible for parole notwithstanding that they would not have been eligible in the other state. No presumption of a grant of parole at the point of release in the sentencing state shall apply in respect of a life sentence. Further amendments are made to the Act with regard to its interaction with the conditional release mechanism under section 2A of the Criminal Justice Act 1960. These are included for completeness should, at some future point, the application of the Act be extended to determinate sentences. I note that a review into the introduction of a tariff system for domestic sentences is under way. These provisions will be reviewed in light of developments in this area.

(9) For the purposes of this Part, the sending of a supervision decision and Article 10 certificate to the Central Authority under subsection (8) shall be deemed to constitute the forwarding of the documents to the Central Authority.”.”.

So many households find themselves now in this position. For mortgage borrowers, the cost-of-living crisis has opened a new front. At the end of 2021 inflation soared, driven by supply chain disruptions as pandemic restrictions were lifted across the globe, and was further turbo-charged by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Since the summer of last year, the European Central Bank, ECB, has responded to inflation by hiking its interest rates. So far, its main lending rate has risen by 3%. This is the most severe round of interest rate hikes in decades. The impact will be acute for many. It has been immediate for some, with their mortgage repayments set to rise by thousands of euro this year. A new source of anxiety is bearing down on them. Another blow, another drop in their living standards, another squeeze on their disposable income. Now is the time to introduce timely, targeted, temporary mortgage interest relief to support them. There are over 700,000 outstanding mortgage accounts on primary or family homes. We know that the interest rate hikes by the ECB are impacting mortgage borrowers differently. Retail banks have not yet passed on these rate hikes in full to their variable and fixed rate customers, but they have started with further rate hikes expected in the time ahead. For the almost 200,000 borrowers on a tracker rate, the impact is significant and immediate. To give an example, a borrower on a tracker rate with €150,000 outstanding on their mortgage will see their monthly mortgage repayments rise by more than €2,600 this year. There is also another category of borrowers, many of whom are with a lender they did not want or choose to be with. Those are mortgage loans that were sold off to vulture funds. There are more than 100,000 Irish families, borrowers whose mortgages are now held by non-banks, 65,000 of which are on variable or tracker rates. Vulture funds are now hiking their rates aggressively, with many borrowers facing interest rates as high as 7.5%. They have no option to switch or to fix their rate. Many of these vultures offer no alternatives. I was contacted recently by a mortgage borrower, Rachel, whose mortgage was sold by Permanent TSB to Start Mortgages. She is a full-time carer for her son, who has cerebral palsy. By January she had received four letters from Start Mortgages, each informing her of a further rate hike. She will be paying over €4,000 in additional interest this year compared to last year. In her own words, Rachel tells me:Hikes across the board from diesel, electricity, gas and food are barely sustainable, but to have the constant fear every month of the next increase coming and how to finance the previous month's increase, is inhumane. It has become the norm now, that due to this severe financial strain on us, we have to now pick and choose what therapies and hospital appointments we can afford for our son to attend.Those were Rachel's words. Another borrower who contacted me has her mortgage held by Pepper. She is a single parent. She will be paying €2,800 in additional interest as a result of these rate hikes. In her own words, she says:I have no option to fix. I work part-time in order to bring my kids to school. This is causing me huge stress and anxiety. I am in fear of further hikes.Many households now face, as the stories of real lives I have relayed make clear, acute financial pressure. They have received three, four and five letters through the door and face the prospect of a sixth next month, when the ECB hikes its interest rates again in four weeks' time. For many families, the ability to pay the mortgage is just as crucial as the ability to pay the rent or the energy bill. The alternative to them, of not doing so, is arrears, increased debt and financial insecurity. For all of these reasons, it is time to introduce timely, targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief to support those borrowers who are and will continue to struggle as a result of increased interest costs. I call on the Government to act and for this Dáil to support our motion to reintroduce mortgage interest relief at a level of 30% of the additional interest charged since last June, up to a maximum benefit to an individual of €1,500.

It has already hiked rates this year and it is still only February. In line with their policy of forward guidance, they have already indicated that they intend to raise rates by another 50 basis points in March. That means a crisis for many mortgage holders. The Minister will be aware, and I am sure that people tell him in his clinics, in his local shops and at the butchers, about the real pressure they face as a result of these rises. These are people who are now coming off fixed rates or who had been on tracker mortgages. They are seeing sharp increases in their payments and they simply do not have that additional money to spend. They do not know where they are going to get it. Obviously, these hikes will not be applied universally across the board. There will be different rates depending on whether the person is on a variable, tracker or fixed rate. It will also depend on who is their lender. However, we do know that many people are experiencing this impact at this very moment. For instance, we know that the average tracker has increased over the last nine months, from just over 1% to 4.1%. For someone whose mortgage may have been sold to a vulture fund, they could have rates of more than 7%. This is really impacting them in terms of thousands extra that will be required for their mortgage repayments. That is why we are bringing forward this motion. It proposes a timely, targeted and time bound relief measure for all those people who are really struggling at this moment. We believe this can be done, and on an affordable basis. It will help those people who are struggling at present. It only applies to the principal primary residence.As such, we are not talking about providing relief to landlords or people with second or third homes. This motion is focused on those who are struggling to afford to get by. Since it uses an interest reference rate applied to a mortgage loan in June 2022, the relief would be based on the difference in the interest payments between the reference rate and the higher interest rate in 2023. This means our butchers, shopkeepers and others in our communities who are struggling to pay their mortgages and other bills would get some kind of relief. We need to be clear that we are listening to them about the struggles they are facing.

This is a targeted motion to help people at a time when the cost-of-living crisis is overwhelming for ordinary families. We know the Government cannot solve everyone's crisis, including the cost-of-living crisis, but it can make a difference to ordinary families who need support. That is what this motion would do. What we are proposing to the Government is a solution. The pressure ordinary families are under and their struggle to pay their bills is recognised across the House. I listened to the Taoiseach today while he spoke to our party president, Deputy McDonald. He stated that the hikes were happening to control inflation. The problem is that all bills have gone up, including gas, electricity and food. Mortgage interest rates have increased, especially for tracker mortgages and those on variable rate mortgages. There are people on fixed-rate mortgages that will come to an end this year. They are terrified because they do not know where they will get the money to make up the difference to pay their mortgages. The scheme is a short-term and targeted measure to help such people. Many people are looking to the Dáil and the Government for help because they feel trapped in the middle. They are working every hour God sends and tightening their belts as much as they can, yet they are still struggling to pay their bills and look after their families. In this motion, Sinn Féin is proposing a solution that would go some way towards easing the pressure on families who are struggling and need support. I ask the Minister to engage with us positively and constructively. I hope we can work together. People are looking for leadership and help. This proposal goes some way towards helping them.

The hike we saw last week was the fifth since July, meaning borrowers will be paying thousands of euro more in interest this year. Others are likely to see their interest rates increase in the current period. Tá daoine faoi bhrú dochreidte agus tá siad anois ag féachaint ar chostais ag éirí níos mó. What Sinn Féin is proposing in this motion is affordable, sensible and necessary. This is the right time to introduce targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief. The Minister will be well familiar with the struggles and challenges people are facing. Deputies across the House talk to families every week. The Minister knows all about budgeting from his role. Very few families can comprehend how to budget for an increased cost of up to €2,000. That is a large hole in a family's finances and means major decisions have to be made - bills potentially going unpaid and treatments or other needs being missed out on because of these large extra costs. For some, the increase could be close to €3,000. This issue affects a large number of people. Almost 200,000 households are on tracker mortgages, 129,000 are on standard variable rate mortgages, and 113,000 mortgage accounts are with non-banks and vulture funds and are particularly vulnerable to this situation. The Minister has previously taken a great interest in the issue of mortgage interest relief. In 2015, he described it as "a very important support for families". He also stated: "The process of withdrawing it from existing homeowners at the same time as they are subject to a residential property tax highlights a Government that is pursuing policies that are making home ownership increasingly unaffordable for families". Although his comments were made in a different context - the current context is more severe in some respects - he believed at the time that mortgage interest relief was necessary. It is necessary in this targeted way now. I urge him to listen to people in our constituency and elsewhere who urgently need this help and not to delay it.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	270	I compliment Deputy Doherty on tabling this motion on a mortgage interest relief scheme for homeowners who are under significant pressure. I meet them in my constituency. Indeed, we all meet them regularly. Only last week, I spoke to a woman who told me that, in the past two and a half years, her mortgage had increased by almost €180 per month, causing her difficulties. She was also dealing with increased childcare and other costs. The cost-of-living crisis we all talk about is the reality for many people. In this motion, we are proposing a temporary measure that is targeted at the primary home - the family home - and is limited to a maximum of €1,500 per year. Those who have large mortgages would have needed large incomes to get those mortgages in the first place, so limiting the measure means the amount it would cost the State would be limited. The cost to the State - ensuring the taxpayer is not out of pocket - seems to be one of the Government's primary objectives. In this instance, however, the taxpayer could afford it, given there will be an estimated €6.2 billion surplus this year. We can afford to provide this scheme so that people can continue paying their mortgages, remain in their homes and not fall into further crisis as the situation goes on. According to the Parliamentary Budget Office and our estimate, the scheme would cost between €312 million and €371 million. In the grand scheme of things and in light of the size of the budget surplus we are looking at this year, this is something the Government can afford, especially as the scheme is targeted at those most in need. Many people are struggling to pay their mortgages and make ends meet. The Minister has an obligation to try to provide for them and to support this motion. The Taoiseach was relatively positive towards it today. I hope that continues into the Minister's contribution and we can ensure this motion is passed.

There have been five hikes in the past seven months, with another on the way. That is more than many families are able to take. Under pressure from Sinn Féin, the Government moved to provide a modicum of relief for renters. This was an acknowledgement that, to fund the cost of keeping roofs over people's heads while they also dealt with other pressures, the Government needed to intervene. It did not go as far as we would have liked but it recognised the importance of intervening. That is why this time-bound and targeted measure is needed for those struggling under the weight of repeated interest rate hikes while the cost of everything else is increasing. I dealt with a family in my advice clinic two weeks ago. They did not come to me to speak about mortgage interest relief. In a funny way, though, the meeting was about that. They were paying for private therapies for their disabled son. By right, those therapies should have been provided by the State but it was not doing so. Their son was on multiple waiting lists, so his family saw the need to pay privately for the services their little boy should have been getting. They can no longer afford them, though, so they made an appointment to see me to discuss therapies. They have to cut back. They cannot sustain repeated increases in the simple cost of keeping a roof over their heads. The Minister described mortgage interest relief as "a very important support for families". It is, but families have cut back on everything. They did not need the advice from the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, to shop around.They were already doing that. They have cut back on everything. While all of their other bills are going up, they now find themselves having to juggle and to make the very hard choices about whether they can continue to fund private therapies for their kids and pay their mortgages. Nobody wants to get into debt or arrears with their mortgage. We all know what can happen to families when that happens and the distress it brings. Now is the time for the Minister to intervene to support these families. This is a targeted temporary measure that families desperately need.

In recent months each and every one of my constituency offices, whether in Mullingar, Athlone or Longford, has seen a dramatic increase in people coming in with the dreaded letters from their mortgage providers announcing another increase or drain on their family's resources that they simply do not have the capacity to meet. Many of these people are those who got into difficulty after the last financial crash when the most they had experienced of the Celtic tiger was reading about it in a newspaper as it affected somebody else. They saw their mortgages sold to vulture funds. The same vulture funds can now charge over 7% interest on a mortgage they bought for buttons. The options available to this cohort of people are extremely limited. They cannot move to a fixed rate or move providers. Those doors are firmly closed. So, too, was the option of relying on the Central Bank to take action as it effectively washed its hands of any responsibility. These are families who have met their repayments on time, but the continuing rises in interest rates are having such a disproportionate impact on them that their ability to keep doing so is genuinely in question at this point. They are going to fall into arrears without assistance. These are families who have seen their transport, lighting, heating and food costs increase. They need assistance and they need it at this time. Regulatory officials may not have the power to intervene in the commercial decisions of setting interest rates, but Government does have that capacity and the power to do so. Today is the day to make that decision to do so and to make a commitment to those families and hard-pressed mortgage payers to show the Government hears the plight they are experiencing and that it is willing to go some way to relieving that additional cost they face every month. There have been multiple interest hikes over recent months and we know there are more of these sharp and significant rises in interest costs to come. Now is the right time to do this. I think the Minister and the Taoiseach understand that. The Taoiseach referred to a potential move in the upcoming budget, but in reality that is simply too far away. It needs to be done now and in a very targeted way. We need a temporary mortgage interest relief to see people over this. We must provide that relief on the portion above what the interest would have been in 2022 and limit it to the principal private home.

and— since last summer, the ECB has increased official interest rates on five occasions by a total of 3 percentage points;acknowledges that:— the current inflationary dynamic and general increase in interest rates will present increasing challenges for many individuals;— interest rates are the primary tool to tackle inflation; and— the increase in official interest rates will have an impact on the level of retail mortgage and other loan interest rates here in Ireland and in other countries across the Eurozone Area;recognises that:— the changed interest rate environment will not have a uniform impact on all borrowers and, depending on particular situations, such as the terms of individual contracts, some borrowers will experience a higher increase in interest rates than other borrowers; and— in addition to the general increase in the cost of living, an increase in interest rates will pose difficulties for many borrowers;further notes that the reintroduction of mortgage interest relief, even on a selective or tailored basis, is likely to involve significant costs and needs to be considered, not on an ad hoc basis, but in the context of a range of other cost of living measures being provided;recalls that:— Budget 2023 was a Cost of Living Budget, incorporating a total package of €11 billion, focused on easing the burden of inflation on households and businesses;— an overall budgetary package of €6.9 billion has been provided for this year, including adjustments to income tax bands, increases in tax credits and increases in transfer payments, such as social welfare and pension rates;— in addition, a set of one-off cost of living measures, amounting to over €4.1 billion, took effect from the final quarter of last year, including an extension of the reduction in excise duties and Value-Added Tax on electricity and gas to end-February, three €200 electricity credits and other social welfare and expenditure measures; and— this built on some €3 billion in support provided in advance of Budget 2023;furthermore, notes that:— there is a strong consumer protection framework in place for borrowers who may experience repayment difficulty due to rising interest rates or the cost of living more generally;— all Central Bank of Ireland regulated lenders and credit servicers, both banks and 'non-banks', are required to follow the provisions of the relevant statutory consumer protection codes, including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears; — in particular, all cases of mortgage repayment difficulty have to be handled positively and sympathetically by a lender or servicer with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations, and regulated entities must work with co-operating borrowers to, if possible, put in place a suitable alternative repayment arrangement;— the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland has recently indicated that the Central Bank expects firms to be prepared and to be proactive in supporting their customers to navigate the changing economic environment; and— there are a number of public initiatives to assist people who are in mortgage or other debt difficulty, such as the Abhaile service, which is made up of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Legal Aid Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Citizens Information Board, which provides free financial advice and, where appropriate also, legal advice to people experiencing difficulty with their mortgage; andtherefore:— supports the Central Bank of Ireland as it continues to supervise and engage with regulated firms to ensure that such firms use all their range of forbearance for borrowers facing repayment difficulty;— in particular, encourages the Central Bank of Ireland to continue its engagement with 'non-bank' regulated firms, to ensure that the suite of products provided to their customers who are experiencing difficulty is in line with the Bank's expectations;— calls on the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure that all lenders assess all switching applications in a prudent and fair manner, regardless of the borrower's current mortgage provider; and— notes that much progress has been made in recent years in reducing the level of mortgage arrears, including during the Covid-19 period, and calls on mortgage creditors and relevant public bodies to continue their efforts to further tackle existing mortgage arrears cases.I thank Deputy Doherty and his colleagues for tabling this motion and enabling a debate on what is an important issue. There is no doubt the changes we are witnessing in monetary policy are having a very significant impact on households all over Ireland and, indeed, on many businesses as well. Of course, in recent times we have also seen the cost of borrowing for governments increase. Like the Deputies opposite me, I too receive the emails and phone calls from mortgage holders who are directly impacted by ECB rate changes. In some cases, they are impacted more or less immediately, for example, those on tracker mortgages. More recently, we have begun to see changes in variable mortgage pricing by banks as a result of changes at ECB level. Many mortgage holders have fixed their interest rate in recent times and are not directly impacted, though, of course, when they come off that fixed rate they will have to make a decision in a different environment from the one in which they perhaps fixed their rate initially. It is worth making the point that when the Government brought forward a budget last September, neither the Government nor the Opposition made the case at that stage for mortgage interest relief, even though we had already experienced increases in interest rates from the ECB. The path it was going to follow in the direction of travel of monetary policy was pretty well flagged at that stage. It is also worth making the point that this issue cannot be considered in isolation from all of the other decisions Government has to make. As colleagues across the House will be well aware, we have decisions to make in the next couple of weeks at the latest relating to major taxation and expenditure measures that are due to expire at the end of February. Depending on the decisions the Government makes, there will be a significant fiscal impact from those decisions. Therefore, we have to consider it in the round and consider the decisions the Government is going to make. Looking at the track record we have so far in bringing forward in the budget €11 billion of new measures, about €4 billion of which were once-off and exceptional in nature and around €7 billion of which were core permanent recurring changes, again the focus has been on addressing the cost-of-living pressures households are facing and on supporting businesses get through what is a very difficult time. I say to all lenders, whether they are mainstream bank lenders, non-bank lenders or service providers, that I expect all of them to treat customers fairly and to be sympathetic to the individual circumstances households are facing. Many such households are facing significant increases in their monthly repayments, which will be a burden, and it will be difficult for many of them to repay. I expect lenders to fulfil, both in word and in sprit, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and the consumer protection code. That involves proactively working with those borrowers to ensure they do not fall into arrears. The point has to be made that we now have the lowest level of mortgage arrears in Ireland since 2010. Just over 4% of principal dwelling home mortgages are in arrears of 90 days or more. That is testament to the work of the lenders with the borrowers and the support of Government at different stages in helping people to stay afloat. It is remarkable that during the whole economic downturn and the consequences of Covid, we did not see an uptake in the level of mortgage arrears. It is because of the collective work of everyone, including the regulator, the lenders, borrowers making conscious decisions to prioritise mortgage repayments, and indeed the support of Government. I want everyone, particularly those who have statutory responsibilities, to step up and support mortgage holders who are going to come under pressure. There is no doubt whatsoever about that. Government will, as always, consider what is the most appropriate response to deal with the cost-of-living pressures people are facing. In the next couple of weeks we have decisions to make in that regard. What we cannot do is make it up as we go along and come in on an ad hoc basis every week or second week with new taxation and spending proposals without setting out the overall fiscal plan for the country. It is important we have regard to that when we are making decisions. When we are making proposals, we have to make sure we know exactly how much they are going to cost. We do not have a costing for the proposal that has been put forward here. We now have more than 716,000 primary dwelling mortgage accounts, as of the end of September. Of these, approximately 35% were on tracker mortgages and 26% were on another type of variable rate. If all of these mortgage accounts were to receive a subsidy of €1,500 it would cost in the region of €655 million per annum. Sinn Féin will make the case that is not what is being proposed, but we need to have a costing for any proposal that is put to the House that has a direct fiscal impact on the Exchequer. The sums involved are very large. I know the Deputies have said the measure is temporary. We do not know what temporary means in the context of what is being proposed.

I am in continuous engagement with the Central Bank. I know from that engagement that the Central Bank is actively on the case. It is on the case of ensuring the full implementation of all the statutory codes and the consumer protection rules that are in place through the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. It is important that work continues. We also have to acknowledge the context of the decisions being made by the European Central Bank, despite the consequences for people in their day-to-day lives, which I acknowledge present genuine difficulties for people. However, we need to get inflation down. It is in everyone’s interest that we do so as quickly as possible. We are seeing some progress in this regard. It now stands at 7.7% in Ireland, which is still far too high and well in excess of the ECB target of 2%. Of particular concern is the level of core inflation when we exclude energy and certain food items. We have to work to get inflation down. We must all be conscious in the decisions we make in this regard. When we look in the round at what the Government has done on a phased basis, we see the bullet payments made from October right through to the Christmas period, the changes in welfare and taxation, the reductions in childcare costs that kicked in in January, the electricity credit applied just last month, the further electricity credit that will be applied in the month of March and the other decisions we made to reduce VAT and excise, all of which have continued and now fall due for a decision. Any reasonable person will accept the Government has made a genuine effort to address the very serious cost-of-living pressures that exist. It should be acknowledged that mortgage rates in Ireland in the round are in a very different place relative to our European peers compared with where they were just a short time ago. In December 2022, the average interest rate on new mortgages from credit institutions in Ireland, which currently hold about 84% of primary dwelling mortgages, was 2.69%, the same as at the end of 2021. This contrasts with the position in many other euro area countries. Over the same period, the average interest rate for new mortgages in the eurozone increased from 1.29% to 2.95%. The average new mortgage rate in Ireland, which was among the highest in the eurozone at the end of 2021 and had been for a very long period, is now among the lowest. I am not making a prediction that this will continue but this is the current position, as evidenced again in the retail interest rate statistics published today by the Central Bank. I acknowledge and share the concerns many have expressed about the plight of those paying far higher interest rates. I am very much aware of individual mortgage holders who have received those consecutive multiple letters, to which colleagues across the House referred, and who are now paying interest rates of the order of 7%. This will inevitably place them under genuine pressure. That is why the Central Bank is working proactively with the lenders to make sure these customers are treated fairly, that problems are prevented and that solutions are put in place for them as quickly as possible to ensure they can get through what is a difficult period in the interest rate cycle. We do not know how long this will continue. It is also worth making the point that it is not in the interests of any lender to allow mortgage holders to get back into arrears again. We have invested a lot in switching. We have more work to do. I acknowledge that is not an option for every mortgage customer at this time. I welcome the motion and the proposal but I will not accept it. The Government has to make decisions in the round. This involves looking at all of the fiscal levers we have at our disposal. We have immediate issues on VAT, excise and business supports that need to be decided in the coming weeks. This is where my focus will immediately lie.

We all know of particular individuals who are under significant pressure. We know people on tracker mortgages who may have an added monthly bill of €200. This could be €200 on top of large increases in fuel costs and electricity costs. Other people have spoken about all of the services people may need for their children. They may need disability services they must pay for themselves because State services are not in place. This is the world in which we are operating. The Minister spoke about the fact the Central Bank is on the ball with regard to the necessity of regulation and protections. This is on the basis that we cannot just rely on vendors. This is fair to say. We are speaking about a considerable number of people. We may disagree on what actions we take and what proposals we make and accept, but the Government did make a determination that the cost-of-living crisis was hurting people and that there would be no cliff edge. The Minister is not in support of our motion today. This is wrong and it is a mistake. Beyond that, I would like to think there will be a further look at a suite of issues with which people will need help. We are speaking about a timely measure. This means it has to happen fairly quickly. We are speaking about something temporary. We are also talking about targeted mortgage interest relief. It is a form of relief that was provided in the State previously and has been supported. We see the issues we are dealing with. We know the numbers we are talking about. There are 186,000 tracker mortgages, 129,000 standard variable rate accounts and 137,000 mortgage accounts with non-banks and vulture funds. We all have had these people coming into our offices. We all know the particular issues they have. They have a greater level of difficulty at present. Now is the time we can provide them with some chance to get through this. This is what the supports we have had in recent years have been about. They have been to facilitate people so we do not have a recessionary disaster.

We have a housing crisis, with people struggling to get on the property ladder. For those who own their homes, mortgage repayments that are already difficult to meet will become that much harder to maintain. Owning your own home takes plenty of sacrifice and hard work. Those who have worked extremely hard and saved and sacrificed to own their own homes are often left with very little disposable income. The remainder has already been eaten into by price rises and these interest rate increases. Many will be left with next to nothing in the pot for those moments and experiences that mark the difference between existing and living. In Limerick, the average cost of a three-bedroom semi-detached home is almost €300,000. These rate increases will mean the repayments will be that little bit harder every month. The interest rate hikes expected in March will see them rise from 3% to 3.5%. This is a significant rise that will be felt in the pockets of homeowners. The departure of Ulster Bank and KBC has forced hundreds of thousands of customers to switch their bank accounts. These departures have also led to a less competitive mortgage market. Depending on what lending institution people are with, the interest rate hike will be applied differently. People are already paying over the odds for their homes. The average tracker rate has increased from 1.15% in June 2022 to 4.15%. To put this increase in monetary terms, for a mortgage payer it equates to an increase of €220 per month on an outstanding balance of €150,000 with 20 years left on the mortgage. This is not an insignificant amount. There are, of course, borrowers whose mortgages are in the hands of vulture funds. They have no option to fix or switch. Their interest rates have risen to more than 7%. Coupled with the dramatic cost-of-living increases, the squeezed middle will get squeezed just that bit more. The combined effects of the utility price increases, food price increases and mortgage interest rate increases are impacting on citizens of the State. Something must be done to alleviate their hardship. To this end we need a targeted and temporary intervention of mortgage interest relief. What we propose is sensible and fair. We propose to provide relief on a proportion of mortgage holders' increased interest cost relative to the rate in June 2022. Importantly, we believe this should be a temporary measure in response to the current cost-of-living challenges. It should be targeted and it should be for the primary dwelling only.

The Minister knows the Government cannot stand by. I listened to him from my office when he spoke about the interaction he has with the banks and the Central Bank and what is being done. The Government cannot stand by as people are being hit with increase after increase in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. The Minister has received the same emails as we have. He can see how this is impacting on people who are just coming out of the financial crisis. They were severely hit with banks closing. They had to close businesses. They went through all of that. The trauma of having to absorb these interest rates at a time when the cost of everything else has greatly increased is impossible for them to bear.They are told the only solution is higher mortgage payments when they are already undergoing such costs and they just cannot make sense of the cure to the higher energy and food prices being an increase to mortgage costs. The Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens and that is the bottom line. The only way it can do that in the necessary timeframe is to introduce this mortgage relief. It needs to be targeted, as we said, to those who really need it and it needs to be time-limited. It must apply only to people's homes and not to second homes, holiday homes or rental properties and it should be capped at €1,500. This is a very sensible and necessary measure. Fianna Fáil supported mortgage interest relief when in opposition, so it should not be a problem now. The Government must put aside the party politics and work with Sinn Féin to bring in these supports. The Minister will have received one of the emails sent to me and other Deputies by the married father of four whose mortgage was increased from €715 six months ago to over €3,000. That is a 450% increase. He was on an interest-only mortgage. We have all these things we need to deal with.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	279	Mortgage holders across the country are really struggling at the moment. I have been getting representations and complaints on this from householders in Laois-Offaly, especially over the past couple of months. There is a significant problem with the cost that is coming on top of the cost of living. Some people have been hit with interest rate increases of 3% plus and this means an extra €200 to €400 per month on their mortgage. Last week's hike was the fifth increase since July. That means borrowers will be paying thousands of euro more in interest this year. We are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis that has seen sharp increases in the cost of energy, transport and food and I could go on to list a range of other items. Sinn Féin is looking for the introduction of a targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief scheme. We have had mortgage interest relief in the past. When he was in opposition in 2015, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, described the relief as "a very important support for families". Sinn Féin agrees with him. We are calling for a mortgage interest relief scheme that provides the equivalent of 30% of the increased interest costs relative to June 2022. It would be a temporary measure that is targeted to provide relief to those who are most in need. It is capped at €1,500 and would not apply to second homes, holiday homes or rental properties held by landlords. It would therefore be most beneficial to the workers and families who need support most, which is very important. Sinn Féin has developed these proposals in consultation with the Parliamentary Budget Office and based on the analysis we came up with, it would cost between €312 million and €371 million. The Minister mentioned €600 million. That would apply if everybody had gone on sky-high mortgage interest rates with vulture funds etc. Of course it depends on the ECB rates, as those are what govern this. This measure is sensible, affordable and can be funded by a portion of the State's projected surplus of €6.2 billion in 2023. It has not all been committed to expenditure. Families need real support and not empty words. We have a financial surplus, so the money is there. Ordinary people and especially hard-working mortgage holders need this during this difficult time. I call on Fine Gael, the Green Party and Fianna Fáil to back this proposal. I heard the Minister appealing to the lenders to be responsible and fair but they are not listening. Some of them are charging 7%. I ask that he and the Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, take this on board. We can appeal to them but they do not listen. They do what they are going to do, which is to extract the maximum amount of money. The Minister referenced the 7% rate himself. It is proof they are not listening. We have the power to bring in these measures and I advocate the Government do so.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	280	As a rule, I remain somewhat sceptical about the efficacy of mortgage interest relief in delivering real help to the households who need it most, because our experience has been the mortgage interest relief system in the past tended to favour the better-off with bigger mortgages and therefore assets of greater value. However, in light of five ECB rate hikes since last July, there is an argument for a measure like this that is targeted and time-limited. The Irish banks were initially reluctant to pass on these ECB hikes to domestic mortgage holders but inevitably that has changed more recently and householders now face major hikes in their mortgage bills. It is in that context that I and the Labour Party support this motion for targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief equivalent to 30% of the increased cost of the mortgage, with a cap of €1,500 per annum. I note the Minister's own scepticism and reluctance to back this particular approach but the principle enshrined in the motion should at least be explored by him and his Department. We would like to see the Government go further and adopt the Labour Party approach to deliver real relief to mortgage holders by guarding against future rate hikes through the introduction of a mortgage rate cap, which is a principle the Minister is familiar with. People are already being hammered by the cost-of-living crisis, so news that rates are set to rise again will come as another body blow to households that are, as we and the Minister know too well, already struggling to make ends meet. As the Minister articulated earlier, many of the once-off reliefs and expenditures introduced by the Government towards the end of last year are running out. Accordingly, people at the sharper end of the cost-of-living crisis are really going to struggle over the next few months if other initiatives are not taken by the Government. There is a real inevitability to rates continuing to rise and rise and that is why the Government must urgently get to grips with this situation. It must stop playing catch-up, as it did with efforts to meet the rising energy costs problem and associated cost-of-living issues. The Labour Party proposed legislation to take the heat out of this situation and to relieve some of the financial pressure on mortgage holders. Our Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2022 would enable the regulator to impose caps on mortgage interest rates charged by banks where a market failure is shown. There has objectively been a market failure here. The Minister will agree, or at least his past comments align with the contention there has been, and is, a market failure in the context of the residential mortgage market. That is notwithstanding the figures he put on record a few moments ago showing where Irish new mortgage rates sit in a European context. That was not always the case. For the last few years, Irish variable rate mortgage holders were paying the second-highest mortgage interest rates in the EU. It is not because of any Government initiative that the figures have changed and the Irish situation is now a case of mid-table respectability or at the lower end of the spectrum but because the banks have, up to now, been at least reticent to pass on some of the ECB interest rates, though that is changing. The Labour Party legislation to which I referred is similar to and draws inspiration from a Bill tabled by the Minister when he was Fianna Fáil spokesperson on finance in 2015 and 2016. If it was the case that in a period of low interest rates as prevailed in 2015 and 2016 when he proposed that Bill, which attracted great attention and scrutiny and went to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage at committee, then surely there is a necessity for a Bill like this now in a very changed environment. It was okay at a time when we had low interest rates and now, during a period of higher rates the Minister appears to have changed his position. I find that quite extraordinary. The Oireachtas has already imposed a cap on the interest rates charged by moneylenders, so there is a strong precedent for action. We remember the exploration of the legislation published to rein in moneylenders and introduce that cap and it shows there is no constitutional impediment to enabling the Central Bank to intervene in the market and introduce reasonable caps on interest rates charged by financial service providers once a process of examining the market has been undertaken, along with a range of other proportionate steps. The only impediment to such legislation is political will. The Government must do all it can to cushion the body blow of these interest rate rises and we believe a cap on mortgage interest rates will save families thousands of euro over the lifetime of their loans. According to media reports last week mortgage interest rates could soar towards 4% this summer as Irish banks begin to pass the costs on to more customers. AIB is introducing rate increases across all mortgage types for the first time since the ECB began to hike rates last July and this move, as the Minister knows, will affect thousands of borrowers. AIB made the move just hours after the ECB announced the latest hike in rates of 0.5%, bringing the total increase in rates since last summer to 3%. The AIB rise will affect all tracker and fixed mortgages. AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB have spared their variable rate customers until now despite the European Central Bank having raised rates four times in six months to last December, and have only passed some of the hikes to fixed products. When asked if the latest rise will be the last, President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, ominously said "No" five times and she was quite emphatic. She said they know they have ground to cover and they know they are not done, when she spoke about interest rate rises and the use of those tools available to them to tackle inflation.  Five successive hikes have now added up to €400 per month to a €330,000 mortgage, with a further rise next month to add approximately €88 more. Bank of Ireland has been slow to increase mortgage rates so far in a bid to take more market share, it seems, but the bank's shareholders are now calling for higher prices, and rising rates there could be around the corner, affecting tens of thousands of more bank customers. This is an already enormously profitable bank, a bank that seems to be on its way to posting profits of approximately €1 billion the next time it posts. Who is representing the public interest here? It does not seem to be the Government. I urge the Minister to not act and behave as a commentator and to make what interventions he can to try to support those who need the most support in terms of rising interest rates. In the brief time I have left, I want to talk to the Minister about the case of Jimmy Crosbie, a father of two from Ardee who works as a taxi driver. The name might be familiar to the Minister because Jimmy spoke to "Prime Time" last week about the situation in which he finds himself. He had his residential mortgage, the mortgage on his principal private residence, with Permanent TSB. In 2015 he organised a split mortgage. It was a performing loan in layperson's language and in terms of our understanding of it. He never missed a payment. In 2019, and he spoke to "Prime Time" about this, Glenbeigh bought his mortgage and it is now being serviced by Pepper. The kinds of interest rates people like Jimmy are now being charged are absolutely extortionate. They would make the mafia blush and are putting families like Jimmy's in a very difficult situation indeed. The Minister told Mark Paul of The Irish Times a couple of weeks ago that he had written to the Central Bank to express his concerns about the high rates of interest being charged by financial institutions affecting people like Jimmy. Has the Central Bank responded to the Minister at this stage? From media reports, I believe the Minister asked the Central Bank if it required additional powers to further regulate these funds and these financial service providers. Last week, I asked the Minister for a copy of that letter through a parliamentary question but all I got was essentially a repeat of what appeared in The Irish Times. That particular letter is FOI-able. It is a public document so I do not see any reason it could not have been provided in the public interest. What did the Minister ask the Central Bank in terms of regulatory powers? What does the Minister plan to do to support people like Jimmy Crosbie to make ends meet and to make their mortgage payments in this very difficult environment?

The Sinn Féin motion notes all the different difficulties associated with the high interest rates in this country and the burden that places on ordinary families trying to provide homes for themselves. That is all very worthwhile and there are a lot of questions to be asked about why our interest rates are so out of line with other European countries. The motion provides for five key asks and there is no difficulty with a number of them. Sinn Féin calls for the Government to offer hard-pressed families real support and not empty words and that certainly needs to be done in relation to the very high cost of housing. The high cost of housing is having such a massive negative impact on all aspects of people's lives that it is the key failure of this and the last Government. What has been missing from what the Government has been doing, or has been failing to do, in relation to housing is to drive down the cost of housing. That should be the key objective of any housing policy, that is, to drive down the cost of housing. We need much more action from Government in terms of providing real support and not just empty words. Another two asks are to work with the Central Bank to enhance the supervision of vulture funds in the interest of struggling borrowers, which certainly needs to happen, and to examine the taxation of the banking sector, including the treatment of corporation tax loss relief, which is another area that needs attention. When it comes to the proposal to reintroduce mortgage interest relief at a level of 30%, I can understand the motivation behind that but we have to reflect on the experience with mortgage interest relief in the past. There is certainly a chequered history in that regard. For a very long period under successive Governments we had a regime where there were property-based tax reliefs or tax breaks and they caused a lot of difficulties and a lot of pain for people, ultimately, because particular reliefs were being given to the construction industry and to developers generally. Of course with a number of those schemes, we paid a very high price for them ultimately. I will talk about the experience of mortgage interest relief because we know that it existed until 2012 when it was cut off for new mortgage applicants. It was phased out over a long number of years for those who had availed of it and it finally finished in 2016. The effect of mortgage interest relief was to reduce the monthly cost of a mortgage to the borrower, those who were availing of it. It amounted to a transfer of public money in the form of a tax break to individual homeowners who were essentially receiving taxpayer support, but for those who could not afford to buy a home and therefore could not avail of the tax break, they were essentially subsidising those who could. Mortgage interest relief was given at the borrower's marginal rate of tax and, therefore, those on higher incomes paying the higher marginal rate benefitted more than those on lower incomes. Taking all of this into account, mortgage interest relief is typically considered a regressive measure because it is transferring public funds, including from low-income people, to those who are relatively better off. From that point of view, it is something a lot of left-wing parties generally have difficulty in justifying. Of course, fiscal sustainability must also be a consideration in any scheme like this. There is an argument that mortgage interest relief creates a kind of false economy, using taxpayer funds to mitigate the effects of Ireland's comparatively high mortgage interest rates and subsidising bank profits in the process. One has to ask whether that is a desirable objective. It it also artificially reducing a household's mortgage interest payments and if the policy is withdrawn, whether due to a change in policy priorities or a shortage of public funds, the tap cannot be suddenly turned off because it risks creating huge mortgage distress. Once it is in place, it is very hard to take away, something which was evident in the long phasing-out period of the policy for those who had been availing of it previously.In some ways, the situation with the housing assistance payment, HAP, offers a comparison. It started off modest in scale and scope and now it costs €1 billion every year. It supports high rents and this is the difficulty. We must avoid measures that will contribute to the growing cost of mortgages and housing generally. While the temptation is to bring it in on a temporary basis, and this is understandable, it is, in effect, a targeted measure at the upper part of the income wealth distribution. Again, therefore, we would have to regard this as a regressive policy. We should really be looking at other ways of trying to support people who are desperately struggling with the cost of living and to do this in a way that is more targeted. There are problems with elements of this proposal. It is suggested that it will be done in a timely, targeted and temporary way, that it would be a temporary interest relief to support homeowners facing significant increases in mortgage costs and that mortgage interest relief would be equivalent to 30% of the increased interest costs relative to June 2022, up to a total figure of €1,500. The asks are quite unspecific. There is a strong case for this measure being targeted, but we do not know what is being proposed regarding the targeting of this measure. This is not spelled out. Equally, who should this be targeted at?  This reminds me greatly of what the Government's approach has been to the exceptionally high cost of housing. This has come about as a result of successive Governments. Certainly going back to 2010 and 2011, the provision of housing has been left predominantly to the market. While house prices have increased considerably over that period, at no point has the Government set out to make housing more affordable and to drive down the cost of housing. That is how we make housing more affordable. The measures introduced by the Government, therefore, have been beneficial to individual homeowners in a position to avail of these schemes, including help-to-buy, the first home initiative, also known as the shared equity scheme, and Croí Cónaithe. Those schemes in themselves have not contributed to driving down the cost of housing and making housing more affordable to people across the board. This should be the objective of any policy measure. We in the Social Democrats have talked about measures that could be introduced by the Government which would actually drive down the cost of housing. It has clearly been the case, though, that Fine Gael did not want to do that for its own particular interests. Sometimes, it feels this way when we look at the kinds of houses advertised in The Irish Times, for example. I looked at a page of them the other day from a well-known estate agent and there was not a single house that cost less than €1.2 million. This was a full page of house advertisements. This is what we are talking about, and the prices went up to €4.5 million. There is a certain cohort of people who maybe feel better about themselves for some reason because their houses have increased substantially in value. Maybe Fine Gael is afraid of upsetting people like that, whereas on a public policy basis the aim should be to make housing more affordable.  The only way we can do that in a sustainable way is to actually drive down the cost of housing. We in the Social Democrats have proposed a number of different measures. The vacant homes tax, for example, could have been done in a realistic way rather than the meaningless way the Government has done it. There could be a tax on investment funds. Affordable homes could be made available by various housing co-operatives that have proven this can be done cheaply on public land. There should also be a land price register and an ownership database. There are, therefore, other ways of doing this but the objective must be not to provide temporary supports which actually fuel the cost of housing. This is my concern regarding mortgage interest relief. We should have a specific policy which is designed to drive down the cost of housing and make people's lives more livable.

While there would have to be some debate about whether this is the best way to assist people, it highlights that something has to be done to assist people who are being hit with these increased costs to service their mortgages. I have certainly received quite a few messages and emails from people who have been pretty hammered with these mortgage interest hikes. It is difficult to see how people can absorb these interest hikes at the same time as they also are seeing significant increases in the cost of living at every level across the board. We saw the figures regarding food inflation today and we know about the energy price hikes. The general cost of living is going through the roof, so this is another hit for another significant cohort of people. In the round, we are talking about, and estimates vary, ordinary workers on average probably being €4,000 to €5,000 less well-off than they were a couple of years ago. This is a huge hit for people and we must do something. The first call I would make on this Government, given the sort of multiple hits people are taking, and I am not just saying this as some sort of rhetorical flourish to have a go at the Government, is that we really have to have an emergency budget soon to deal with the cost-of-living crisis that people are facing. There is a whole range of measures that must be taken. We can debate the whos, whys and wherefores of what has been done but it is just not enough and something will have to be done. I do not think we can wait until October to do it because people are really being hit hard. Different people are being impacted in different ways but across the board, real pain and hardship are being felt by people. This cannot be disconnected from the issue of housing and the cost of housing. The Minister might be interested in this example, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, because it is in her constituency. It is also emblematic. I went on to daft.ie to look at house prices in Cherrywood the other day. The cheapest thing that could be seen for sale there, for very modest houses, was on sale for more than €650,000. The prices went up to well over €700,000. This is the biggest residential development in the country. It originally got planning permission under the strategic development zone, SDZ, measure for 8,000 houses. This figure has recently been increased because of heights and so on. This development would have had a major impact on the housing crisis in our area if the houses were sufficiently affordable and if there was a greater proportion of social housing etc. These prices, however, mean this development is just contributing to making a bad situation worse. If there are people who can manage to get a mortgage on these houses, and it is necessary to have pretty high earnings to get one on a property of this price, this is an accident waiting to happen if anything else goes wrong, as we know from the Celtic tiger years. House prices then were so high that people did get loans from the banks but then they lost their jobs and we were in a nightmare scenario. We cannot have house prices at this level and we cannot have ordinary working people on average or even a bit above average earnings trying to service mortgages for houses that are this price. I just do not believe this is sustainable. It is an accident waiting to happen. We must, therefore, deal with the affordability of housing. While this is a multifaceted issue, in essence I simply do not see what the point is in building houses that people cannot afford.The first thing the State must do is flood the housing sector with public and affordable housing and, insofar as it can, take further measures to control the behaviour of the banks. I do not want to be overly political about this, but it is the truth because it was said explicitly at a time. One of the reasons we have such unaffordable house prices in this country is because after the crash the policy of the Government was to refloat the property market. That was a conscious policy aimed at restoring the balance sheets of the banks, and it was explicitly stated by Michael Noonan, the former Minister for Finance, at the time. It might have seemed like a sensible idea - we did not think it was at the time - but, in retrospect, it was an absolutely disastrous idea because the imperative to improve the balance sheets of the banks and save them has led us to where we are now. Those same banks are still getting tax breaks as a result of losses carried forward. They are back to making extortionate profits. We are in and environment whereby Irish banks and mortgage lenders are charging higher interest rates than is the case anywhere else in Europe. While the Government will not agree, I am of the view that this is an argument for having a not-for-profit, publicly controlled banking system to prevent profiteering. The banking sector is in trouble whatever way one looks at it. Some people think the answer is more competition; I do not. I just think it proves that a competitive banking market, in and of itself, is an accident waiting to happen. We need a banking system that is actually about serving the interests of society and not just making profits for investors and shareholders. We need to ensure that, where it is needed, credit is available to ordinary working people to allow them to put a roof over their heads. Unless we get that model, we will be in trouble. We need to ensure that housing is affordable for ordinary people. I just do not think the market has shown this. How many years do we need to go on before we decide that whatever role we think the market has - the Minister will say we must have some role for the private market - it is absolutely clear that the private market is not capable of delivering housing that is affordable to the vast majority of working people. The evidence is plain to see. Some people may be able to afford houses for €700,000, but the vast majority cannot to so. If we do not address that, messing around with credit will not fix the problem. The Government must think about the prospect of basic incomes to help people through this. That comes back to the emergency budget issue. Average workers cannot soak up a loss of income of €4,000 to €5,000. Again, this is an accident waiting to happen. People will get very angry unless we address that quickly. There is one basic thing the Government must do. The Minister will say this could potentially be inflationary and all the rest of it. At a minimum, people's incomes, through wages, pensions or social welfare, must keep pace inflation but they are not. If they are less than keeping pace with inflation, people are poorer and, as a result, more vulnerable to other things that are happening, such as the cost-of-living crisis, mortgage interest hikes or whatever. As an emergency necessary measure, we must do that as well. For the structural change that is necessary, the State must be able to deliver affordable housing. Affordability means that people should not be spending more than 20% to 30% of their net income on putting a roof over their heads - whether that is servicing a mortgage or paying rent. If the State is not capable of doing that, we have problem. At the moment, it is clearly not doing that. The market, on its own, is absolutely incapable of doing it. Unless we confront that reality, we are going nowhere. We also need to look at wealth distribution. We do not even have proper figures on wealth distribution. Whatever take one has on it, the Oxfam report demonstrates that the rich in this country are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. That is an indisputable fact. Unless we introduce a taxation policy that will start to address the gap between rich and poor, we are heading down a very difficult and troubled road. The Government needs to start to look at wealth distribution. That means wealth taxes and even knowing where the wealth is in our society.

Last week, the European Central Bank raised its base rate of interest, taking it to a rate of 3%, and pledges to raise rates by the same magnitude in March to squash raging inflation. That would see the deposit rate going to 3% and the main borrowing rate rising to 3.5%. After six years of interest rates sitting at zero, the biggest immediate impact will be on the monthly payments of approximately 200,000 families with a variable rate tracker mortgage. Those with €200,000 tracker mortgages on a rate of 2.5%, which will now rise to 3%, can expect their monthly payments to increase by around €50 at a time. This is at a time when people are struggling to keep their houses warm and put food on the table. For those with existing fixed-rate mortgages that are about to end and who want to remortgage, any new fixed-rate deal will be more expensive than the one they are about to leave. On top of this, mortgage borrowers whose loans were sold to vulture funds are now facing interest rates that are significantly higher than those charged by retail banks, resulting in significant financial pressure for them. Economists are saying that 3% will not be the peak. It is a likely that interest rates will need to be kept higher for longer as loosening prematurely could risk a sharp resurgence in inflation once activity rebounds. However, if it raises rates too aggressively, it could tip the eurozone into recession. The failure of the Government to help existing homeowners at a time when they are subject to a cost-of-living crisis highlights that it is pursuing policies that are making home ownership increasingly unaffordable for families. The original purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was to provide short-term support to eligible people who, due to temporary unemployment or loss of earnings, were unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house that was their sole place of residence. While I accept that the mortgage interest supplement should be a short-term measure, the problem is that there is no short-term measure in place. People need a short-term supplement to ease the mortgage pressure they are under, rather than just loading more debt on them. Given that the Government essentially eliminated the mortgage supplement scheme in 2014, the level of support available from the Department of Social Protection and the Government is limited, with the responsibility for forbearance in respect of a customer’s mortgage difficulties resting with the mortgage provider. The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through ongoing engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution. This restricts the capacity of the State to help people who will be placed in difficulty as a result of this significant increase in the cost of mortgages. We need to step in now. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Taoiseach said last week that there are no plans to introduce mortgage interest relief despite a continual rise in interest rates. In December the Taoiseach, then Tánaiste, said, “It is not something we will rule out for the future but there are no current plans to do so. It would involve reopening the budget and all the consequences that would derive from that.” As we know, thousands of people are under enormous stress with their mortgages. Why do we kick the can down the road? Why wait to act when we know this is inevitable? People in my constituency covering Louth and east Meath are struggling. Every week in my clinic I direct families struggling to pay their mortgages to MABS. While this is a fantastic service, the primary objective of all measures across the housing sector should be to increase the supply of accommodation and keep people in their current homes, whether they are rented or owned. Are we going to close our eyes and pretend that families are not struggling? The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage should engage with the Minister for Finance on the implementation of a temporary measure. This needs to be considered in the overall budgetary and policy context, whether it be through the Personal Insolvency Act to give some help and support to people in mortgage arrears or by making amendments to the Finance Bill to bring about some alleviation for people who are in mortgage distress through the reinstatement of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. We need to act now. We need to make home ownership affordable again through stronger Government interventions to help close the viability gap. We need to offer hard-pressed families real support. I got married in 1983, when I was 21 and my wife was 20. We bought a house for £21,000. As we could not get a bank loan, we went to the council and got a simple £14,000 loan. We went to the credit union for the balance that we needed.It was very simple. Why are we complicating things in this day and age? I repeat that the Taoiseach, who was the Tánaiste at the time, promised Government intervention. I keep saying it to the Minister that he is kicking the can down the road. People are very much struggling. It is now that people need help. I am pleading with the Minister to speak with the Ministers for Housing and Local Government and Heritage, and for Finance, about working together to put a temporary measure in place. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	284	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ministers present. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing it forward. The people we are talking about here are people who are contributing to the economy in every way. These are young people, couples, or single people who went out there and took the brave step of deciding to build or buy their own house. They did not rely on the State to provide housing for them or wait around for something to happen. They decided themselves to get involved in building or buying a home for themselves. They took on and paid all of the costs, including the legal and planning costs, the planning development levies and the VAT that is being put on construction at 13.5%. That is fine. We admire them for that and we should respect them for it. The kernel of the problem is that these same people are now finding themselves becoming the new poor. I know that prior to the budget there was a good deal of kite-flying going on by different Ministers in respect of what they were going to do in the budget. One of the things I heard being said was that we were going to look after working people and bring in a new rate and band of tax which would help people in the middle-income bracket who need that little bit of support. It has not happened for them and it is not happening now. Since last summer, we have had five or six increases in mortgage interest rates. One might say that it only amounts to 3%, but it is going from 0% to 3% and adds €50 a pop. Every increase of half a percentage point adds €50 onto the average mortgage. That is a good deal of money. When young couples come into my office to talk about how they are struggling, where both of them are professionals who work and pay their PAYE and PRSI, they say they are looking for a small bit of a hand. Back in my time when we built our house, a subsidy was available to first-time house buyers and builders. It was something like €3,500 and it was paid out, from memory, by way of €1,500 in the first year and €750 subsequently, or whatever the figure was. There was a benefit in it for the first three or four years of the life of the mortgage which gave people a small bit of breathing space so that they could come to terms with the fact of their mortgage. They had to supply everything into the house to ensure they got to a stage where their income probably increased a bit to allow them to live reasonably comfortably and pay their mortgage then. We now have the new poor. These are the people who are contributing every day to our economy and are the people who did not ask the State for anything. They pay for the costs of going to work and for childminding. They pay for everything. What is wrong is that right now these people are struggling and are actually counting the pennies. They are watching what they do and where they go, and are asking if they can afford to go into town for a cup of coffee, and they cannot. It has gone to that level right now and I am not exaggerating. When people say that they are living like monks at the moment, it is not a joke. They are being serious. These are the people that we expect to be able to go out and do a good day’s work, to enjoy work and living, and to enjoy bringing up their families. Yet the amount of pressure they find themselves under is completely horrendous at the moment. We owe them little a bit more. I say to the Ministers present that we need to do something in respect of mortgage interest relief on a temporary basis for first-time purchasers of houses, whether they are on a variable rate or on a tracker mortgage. Doing this on a temporary basis over the next two to three years is not going to break this country but it will give the real working people of this country, who are contributing to the economy, a chance and a small bit of breathing space. We need to do this legitimately for these people, and do it now. There is no point in talking about doing it in next year’s budget because there are many people who will find themselves going to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS. That is not what they want. They do not want to be talking to MABS about how they can restructure a loan. They want to be able to pay the loan and all they need is a little bit of help for a number of years.

This motion should not be necessary and the Ministers should have the heart and the empathy with the people to support them. These are hard-working people who are carrying the weight of the bank bailout. I called it the bank cleanout at the time. What happened at the time was daylight robbery. All those bankers and bondholders had insurance bonds and were never even touched and were doubly covered. The weight of that then was put down on ordinary people. Now, with inflation and the cost of living, and with the ECB putting up interest rates, where every second week we have a president or somebody coming from the European Parliament, I ask what the Government is trying to do to our people. These are the working people who had the vision and courage to take out mortgages and to house themselves. They did not run or look to the State for housing. Now they are being literally destroyed with interest rate increases which render them having to scrounge for food, to put clothes on their children’s backs, to educate their children and to try to get to work. They just cannot manage. The cost of living and even of going out for a cup of coffee nowadays is just exorbitant. I raised earlier today with An Taoiseach the fuel economy breaks which the Government has given because of the rising cost of fuel and of food inflation at 16%. It has risen by 16% for a trolley of food in the past three months, and we ask that the Government give people some reliefs. The Government says it will tell them in the middle of February but 1 March is fast approaching. These people cannot sleep in their beds at night with the worry. I am sure that the Government Ministers are meeting them in their constituency clinics, if they hold such clinics, or are their cluasa dúnta i gcónaí? Is the Government not listening to them because they are there? The previous Minister for Finance - the jury is out on the current Minister, a bhí ina chara liom uair amháin - was a friend of the banks. I refer to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who is a colleague of the current Minister. His last act was to give the bankers’ bonuses back to them. That allowed a situation where a fair cohort of people will earn €1.8 million a year. What kind of obscene behaviour was that? Who needs or wants at any time €1.8 million to survive and to keep going? Tá mo chuid ama caite. I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Michael Collins.

I fully support any calls for specific measures to provide mortgage interest relief for homeowners. For example, a scheme could and urgently should be designed to provide temporary relief for homeowners facing financial hardship, or to help first-time buyers get on to the property ladder. The scheme could also target certain groups of homeowners, such as those with low incomes or those who are struggling to meet their mortgage payments due to changes in interest rates. Various other EU countries have already implemented policies to support homeowners who are struggling with mortgage payments. These policies have taken different forms such as temporary financial assistance, tax relief, applying pressure on lenders or giving incentives to lenders to offer more favourable mortgage terms. In Ireland, we are witnessing the negative impacts of rising interest rates on both existing homeowners and first-time buyers. Higher monthly mortgage payments are now putting a significant strain on the personal finances of families and homeowners, especially as inflation is eating away at their incomes and the cost of everything else has also increased. Deputy Mattie McGrath has just touched on the cost of fuel, which I brought up in the Chamber in the past week. VAT was taken off fuel in the past year. Surely to God the Government is not even considering putting any percentage of that back up again in the next couple of weeks. The Government is putting off the decision for another couple of weeks, and talking about soft blows, but everyone in Ireland is feeling a very hard blow at present.We hear about a tax take of billions and how happy the Government is about it. Where are the ordinary people in all of this? They are suffering on a day-to-day basis. There are fuel costs for farmers and fishermen. There was a fuel subsidy from Europe to Ireland, worth €5 million. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, would not put his hands out, gather that money and give it back to the inshore fishermen or larger trawler fishermen. He refused to do so. We have a farming crisis caused by the price of fertiliser. Farm incomes have not got any higher. Lack of housing is another major issue. There is a lack of infrastructure, transport, services for the public and home help hours for the elderly. There are many issues. The people have had enough. I fully support measures being put in place for homeowners.

Banks, of course, never lose. When they did, the Government bailed them out with taxpayers' money. When people put their money into the banks, they get very little interest for it. In fact, if they leave it there long enough, it depreciates in value. People with mortgages are suffering. I am adding to the pleas for an interest relief scheme to help those people. The Government could help more with the costs of electricity and running a car. It should do something about the cost of electricity but it is not. If a young couple or anyone else is building a house, more than one third of the cost goes into levies, services and VAT on materials. The banks make it very hard for couples to get mortgages in the first place, yet, the Government has shares in the bank. How is it the Government cannot talk to the banks and help the people it represents? I will tell the story of a young man, Tim Brosnan, who built his house about a year and a half ago. He built it as per regulations and had to put in an air-to-water system. He is on to me every day about the cost of electricity. He is paying €1,200-odd in each bill to cover the cost of his heat pump. It is absolutely ridiculous. He says he has no bother coping with the mortgage but this cost is beating him. He goes out in the dark, comes home in the dark and still cannot make it work. It is easy for him to tell that solid fuel, whether it is oil, turf or timber, is still the cheaper and better option for the people who are suffering. I ask the Government to do something to help people because these regulations are crippling them.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-08 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	288	I welcome the opportunity to speak during this important debate. I support the call in the motion for Government to introduce timely, targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief to support homeowners facing significant increases in their mortgage costs. I also support the call on Government to work with the Central Bank to enhance the supervision of vulture funds in the interests of struggling borrowers. This is an issue that my colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group have been to the forefront on. The Government would do well to remember that in November of last year, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, along with the Green Party, voted against a Rural Independent Group Bill which would have provided legislative protection to farming families against vulture funds. This issue has been going on for years. In 2020, during Leaders' Questions, I raised the fear and terror that these vulture funds are generating through forced farm sales. Such fear and terror re-emerged following the end of the Covid-related moratorium on forced sales. We knew then and we know now from reports by personal insolvency practitioners and farm organisations that some farm sales were even being forced through without any prior notice being given. In addition, the problem of home mortgage arrears is enormous, as we know from the most recent data supplied by the Central Bank. In fact, the outstanding balance on principal dwelling mortgage amounts in arrears of more than 90 days was €6.2 billion, which is equivalent to 6% of the total outstanding balance on such mortgage accounts. Recently, in County Offaly in my constituency, more than 570 family home loans were in arrears for two years or more. However, I suspect that number has increased dramatically more recently. Mortgage holders who happen to be small business owners are also facing a double blow. In recent weeks, I have seen many small businesses forced to close due to utility costs. I ask the Government to do more to help our small businesses, which create so much local employment, to survive in our communities.

I say that for many reasons but, in my short time, I will address two that stand out. First, the proposal is made in the context of inflation levels of more than 7.7%, allied with very significant price increases for many daily essentials such as food, home heating oil, petrol, diesel, etc. I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, say that this issue cannot be considered in isolation, but it is not being considered in isolation. It is being considered in the context I have just spoken about, that is, spiralling inflation and prices for hard-pressed households and, on top of that, increasing mortgage interest rates. Anybody paying a mortgage knows it is a considerable chunk of money out of one's monthly income and most mortgages are paid from monthly incomes. The very significant increase in mortgage interest rates in such a short time means mortgage repayments are increasing significantly every single month, with the real fear that the situation will worsen. The increase is significant for those on tracker mortgages, but it is crucifying for those whose mortgages are held by vulture funds. Approximately 65,000 people, many of them families, are paying mortgage interest rates of 7% or more. I recognise that the Government has not stood idly by and has made efforts to assist individuals and families to manage the spike in the cost of living, but the Minister of State has to agree with me that, at the very best, it is a safety net. While it is an important safety net, families and individuals are still facing much greater demands on their income and are making very difficult choices about food, heating, children's clothes, etc.  Many homeowners paid inflated prices for their homes in the first place and loading significant increases in mortgage repayments on to their shoulders at this time puts them under extreme pressure. Many mortgage holders may not be able to continue paying their mortgages which causes heartbreak and devastation and is a disaster for them and their families. It also adds to the housing waiting list. In my constituency, house prices have increased by 18% in counties Sligo and Leitrim since 2021. They have increased by 14% in Donegal and by a similar amount in County Roscommon. Those who have taken out mortgages recently have paid significantly more for their properties. They are under even more pressure when the interest rate they pay increases because their repayments were calculated based on their monthly income. The proposals in this motion could help. My second reason for supporting this proposal is that it is targeted and temporary, applies to some 30% of the increased costs relative to June 2022 and does not exceed €1,500 per annum. That is what makes this proposal worthy of serious consideration, especially where it is confined to a family home and under no circumstances could be paid on a second property. The amount is capped at €1,500, which means nobody can benefit massively, although it is still a significant amount of money, at approximately €125 per month at most. That is real money for many people and even on a temporary basis, it would make a real difference.I have listened to various opinions on this. The Government seems to suggest that enough is being done, as it were, and we will continue as we are, but most people recognise that is not the case. Others have expressed reservations that it is a regressive taxation step. If it were the old mortgage interest relief scheme, I would agree but it would be capped and temporary and while there would be a transfer of some economic benefit to home owners, it is small and designed to help those who are most at risk of not being able to continue paying their mortgages.  Finally, the Government has tabled a countermotion that takes an as-you-were position but this morning during Leader's Questions, the Taoiseach did not set his face against the proposal. I hope that on reflection, the Minister for Finance will not do so either.

Ní bhfuair mé deis é sin a rá go dtí seo agus go n-éirí léi ina ról nua. I thank Sinn Féin, as usual, for tabling this motion which has merit. While I have some concerns, it is time-limited, targeted, capped and it is for family homes. Why does the proposal have merit? We are talking about more than 400,000 families that are struggling on different types of mortgages, with prices rising daily. I agree with Deputy Shortall who put it very well earlier when she said that we cannot look at this in isolation. We are tampering with something because Government policy is embedded in a completely dysfunctional system. The Minister of State might not agree but that has been my opinion since the day I arrived into Dáil Éireann. The housing policy of this and the previous Government is utterly dysfunctional and, therefore, we are left supporting motions such as this and saying it is worth looking at when really, houses have to be built and prices have to come down. The price of my house has to drop and the price of the Minister of State's house, if she has one, simply has to drop. It is not possible to have sustainable living with house prices going up as they are.  It is not possible to call Government policy coherent when it is allowing the market to dictate. Ministers have stood up in the Chamber and said that is not accurate but it is. Let me just mention the help to buy scheme. It is worthwhile looking at the reviews of that scheme. It has been described as "not a rational scheme" and reviewers said that they would not start from here but ,unfortunately, it is now embedded and we cannot take it out. The HAP scheme represents the worst possible change in housing policy. It is still with us and the cost continues to rise, with €1 billion mentioned earlier. We also have the mortgage to rent scheme and some of those who are struggling with mortgage payments now will move on to that scheme. Issues with the mortgage to rent scheme were brought to my attention and forced me to read into it further. It was introduced in 2012 and was to be run by voluntary bodies and housing associations. They did okay but the uptake was quite low because they did not have the capability and they were not helped to build that capability. What did the Government do in 2018? It invited expressions of interest for a private company to come forward, with the misleading name Home for Life. The homes are not for life but for 25 years. Misleading language is used, with talk about local authorities as landlords when they are not the landlord; the Home for Life company is the landlord or the voluntary body. The Government twists and turns language and make the tenants believe that they are social housing tenants when they are not.  Let us look at what happened to the scheme when the aforementioned company got involved. The company is now in the Commercial Court. I am not going to get into that because I understand the separation of powers but that company is now in that court because it had an agreement with another company to do repairs and there is a dispute about that. More importantly, several local authorities, including Dublin City Council, reported issues with Home for Life repair works, prompting the Housing Agency to launch an investigation. In inspections of 224 Home for Life properties carried out by late October, 166 homes had issues and would need further work to be carried out. I am mentioning this to illustrate the point that we have gone further down the road of privatisation, with private companies coming in, instead of building up the voluntary bodies. I understand that further expressions of interest will be sought from more companies. What those companies do is buy the house of a person who is in mortgage distress, like a person I have in mind in Galway, they do the repairs, get the rent, keep the asset and they lease it back to the local authority for 25 years. That is called a home for life. One of the advantages of the scheme was that participants could buy back their home after five years. Does the Minister of State know how many repurchases there have been? There have been six. Has there been a business case analysis? No. Has there been a review to see what the scheme has cost? Is there any understanding of the agreement between the local authorities, the Housing Agency, and the Department or any analysis of what money has been paid over? Absolutely not and I am sure we will be told it is commercially sensitive. This is another little ingredient added to an already dysfunctional market that ensures fewer people will own their own home, fewer will be able to rent a public house at a controlled rent and fewer will have security of tenure for life. This is because of the dysfunctional housing policies from successive Governments.

I will try to address as many of them as I can. I do not necessarily agree with all the points made but I do see coherent trends among them, including a real and genuine concern around inflation and increasing house prices, and the targeting of supports most effectively. I will try to address all of those concerns. As the Minister for Finance said earlier, the debate is happening in the context of a significant inflationary environment, albeit 2% lower than it was last year but still 5% ahead of where we should be on the ECB measure and where we would be in any way comfortable. That is creating significant cost-of-living pressure that Deputies are hearing about from their constituents on a day-to-day basis. The Minister has set out the response of the Government, which includes both one-off and permanent measures to try to address that pressure. In the budget last year, €11 billion worth of support was aimed primarily at supporting households through this period of exceptionally high inflation. Before Christmas those on social welfare received a double weekly payment and a Christmas bonus. Lump sum payments were made to people who are in receipt of the fuel allowance, living alone allowance and the working family payment. A €500 once-off payment was made to those receiving the carer's support grant, the disability allowance, the blind pension and the disability pension. A further double child benefit payment was made to approximately 640,000 families. Before Christmas we also had the first in a series of electricity credits, with a second administered last month and a third one planned for March.  A number of permanent cost-of-living measures also came into effect, which some Deputies referenced, such as the increase to the entry point for the higher tax bands and an increase to tax credits. There has also been a general increase in social welfare payments of €12 per week, which came into effect recently. We also created a new rent tax credit of €500 for a qualifying individual or €1,000 for a qualifying couple for both 2022 and 2023. There have also been significant changes to the national childcare scheme.  It is clear the Government understands the inflationary pressures that people are facing and has tried to introduce targeted supports in so far as possible. However, it is not credible to simply go, week on week, to corporation tax receipts. It is important to recognise that we are dependent on what are highly volatile corporation taxes and if what we estimate are windfall taxes are excluded, there was an underlying deficit of approximately €5.25 billion last year. We have to be careful about the management and sustainability of the public finances. We are concerned about the inflationary cycle and, as the Minister said, we have genuine concerns about core inflation. In that context, mortgage interest relief is an unusual measure to try to advance at this time, having regard to the effect it would have. We phased out mortgage interest relief specifically because of its impact on increasing house prices. Mortgage interest relief for principal private residences was phased out, as Deputy Shortall outlined earlier, between 2009 and 2020. The decision to abolish it was taken in the wake of the financial crisis, with the cost of the relief being one of the influencing factors. At its peak, it cost more than €700 million in 2008. As a measure, it also contributed to rising house prices. Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, found that mortgage interest relief results in higher rather than lower house prices, where housing supply is constrained, as it gives buyers more purchasing power.In addition, the OECD highlighted significant equity concerns, noting that mortgage interest relief provides greater benefits to high-income households as they are more likely to be homeowners, a point that aligns with the findings of the 2009 Commission on Taxation. That sits against the point of it being a relief targeted at the most vulnerable. All the international research suggests it is not so targeted. Mortgage interest relief has also been found to encourage household indebtedness and is correlated with volatility on the housing market. It is for those reasons that the Commission on Taxation and the OECD recommended limiting or phasing out mortgage interest relief on owner-occupied housing. As has been said, prior to its curtailment and eventual abolition, in 2005, for example, mortgage interest relief benefited best the top two income deciles, which accounted for close to half of the tax foregone through tax relief. It was again highlighted in the 2009 Commission on Taxation report. Mortgage interest relief puts up house prices and benefits the wealthier in the community in the context of the scale of relief available. It simply is not targeted at the most vulnerable, if that is who the Sinn Féin motion is attempting to target. I am not sure which cohort of borrowers the motion is targeting. Is it targeting all 716,000 mortgage accounts? Is it targeting those on tracker, variable or fixed mortgages? What is the equity position between those situations? In November 2022, more than 93% of new mortgages created were fixed mortgages. Many people who switched to a fixed mortgage may have done so as the interest rate changes were well signalled last year. It is unclear to me in what way it is being targeted. Neither is the costing clear. Deputy Doherty identified a figure of €1,500 annually but no costs were put forward by Sinn Féin until Deputy Stanley, the 11th Sinn Féin speaker on the motion, put forward a figure of approximately €340 million. Perhaps Deputy Doherty will clarify that. It is clear from a straightforward read of the 716,300 primary dwelling mortgage accounts at the end of September 2022 that for each of those to receive a subsidy of €1,500 would cost in the region of €655 million per annum, which is a substantial fund of money. There is no point in Deputy Doherty laughing about this.

It might be better if he signalled any interest in those proposals in the Sinn Féin budget document. The word "mortgage" features once in the Sinn Féin mortgage document. Sinn Féin makes no effort to provide for private home owners of any description in its mortgage document or its housing documents but it is now interested in mortgage holders and those who own private homes. It made its budget choices and that is fine - I respect it making its own budget choices - but it did not make this choice. These interest rate changes were well signalled but Sinn Féin made no reference to them at the time. Perhaps Deputy Doherty will allow me to finish without interruption. I do not need to be called "stupid" on the floor of the House-----

The overall fiscal framework has not changed. The cost-of-living crisis remains and, as Deputy Doherty and others know, the Government is well aware of the challenges people are facing. In that context, in the coming weeks, as has been well planned and signalled, the Government is considering, in the context of measures that were introduced in the budget, how to provide the best and most targeted supports on a sustainable basis that would be of the broadest benefit to the greatest number of people. Those decisions have been signalled. They will cost significant sums and the Government has to work out what are the best measures to take that forward. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, along with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the leaders of the three parties in government are considering that at this time. In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for credit unions, I see a substantial opportunity for credit unions to come more firmly into the mortgage market. This is a slightly different point but it is one I want to make every time I can do so. There are significant sums in reserve. The loan-to-asset ratio of credit unions is too low, at 27%. There is an opportunity to create another force in the mortgage market, which has been uncompetitive in the Irish context due to the exit of various banks in the past decade. There is an opportunity for credit unions, however, which are local and trusted financial institutions, to play a much stronger role as community banks and in the mortgage market. I would welcome that considerably. As Deputy Doherty is aware, we will be taking forward legislation to try to provide the structures that would support credit unions in that way.

It is an important debate because so many people are struggling as a result of high interest rates. For some borrowers, they have increased on five occasions since June of last year. I described some of the arguments put forward by the Government as stupid arguments. I did so because the Government speakers have tried to suggest that every mortgage holder in the State will get €1,500. However, the motion is clear, as the Minister of State would know unless she has not read it, that it relates to the increased interest rate since June last year. It is not the case that everybody would get €1,500. That is a nonsensical suggestion. I made clear in my earlier contribution that we work with the Parliamentary Budget Office - I am sure the Ministers opposite will recognise the independence and professionalism of that office - and it costed this proposal for us. It did so on the basis of assumptions in respect of interest rate increases that could happen in the coming period and those that have already taken place. I can touch on that point again later. There is a clear motivation on behalf of the Government in this context, and it is not about the interest rate or the fact that people spoke in public, such as on "Prime Time" last week, for example, about being mortgage prisoners and how they are now paying 7.5%. The Government's objective does not relate to reaching out or trying to support those individuals; rather, it is to somehow suggest this is going to cost €600 million or €700 million and so on-----

It is about trying to minimise, downplay and brush off instead of recognising there are probably people listening to this debate who are hanging on and hoping against hope that the Government will see sense in the context of introducing this proposal. The Minister said the proposal would push up house prices - this from a Minister who believes the help-to-buy scheme will not do so. Let us be clear. As this measure does not increase the purchasing power of the individual, it would not have the effect suggested by the Minister. That is why it is tailored. It is not like the mortgage interest relief introduced by Fine Gael, which applied to all the interest one paid on a mortgage, with no caps in place. That is why the wealthiest got that benefit. As it was not time limited, it did increased borrowers' purchasing power because they were able to factor in that some of the interest would be paid by the State. The motion is about the increased interest rate. It is spelled out in black and white. It is the increased interest rate that has happened since June last year. The Minister of State's argument again falls in that regard. I am begging the Government to address this issue. We have had different signals from the Government. This morning, its leader seemed to be open to the idea because he recognises the ECB will increase interest rates again next month. There are 118,000 people who have family mortgages with vulture funds. The Minister of State's party leader gave them assurances they would be no worse off but that was complete and utter balderdash. They are far worse off. The former Minister for Finance, now Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, said he would have no problem if his loan was bought by a vulture fund. Let me spell this out in clear terms. The biggest tranche of loans that went to vulture funds was sold by Permanent TSB. If those loans were still with Permanent TSB, the borrowers would be paying less than 4%, which is the highest standard variable rate with Permanent TSB. Instead, in some cases they are now paying 7.5% with Pepper. That means they are paying more than €400 extra per month, or close to €5,000 per year. Next month, they will get a sixth letter in the door because the ECB at its March meeting will increase interest rates by another 0.5%. These people, who are now paying an interest rate of close to 8%, are thousands of euro worse off than they would have been if they were with Permanent TSB. The commitments given by the Government in the past, and particularly by the political parties in government, are clearly void.The people here see very clearly that they are so much worse off. Not only that, people have come to me who are victims of the tracker mortgage scandal. Permanent TSB took money from them to which they were entitled, in the form of interest rates, and because they were in financial distress they had to go for split mortgages. Their repayments on these split mortgages were more than if they had the original tracker rate to which they were always entitled. Their loans were then sold to vulture funds because they were in split mortgages. What is happening now? They are paying at a rate of 7.5%. They were screwed by Permanent TSB. Their tracker rate was taken off them. They had to go into an arrangement and, because of the way Permanent TSB structured such arrangements, they were deemed to be non-performing loans and were, therefore, sold on. These individuals did nothing wrong. If the principle relating to restoration is to be followed through, these individuals should be back with Permanent TSB and paying at a rate that is significantly lower than what the vultures are charging. As I said, we have worked with the PBO to cost this measure. It would provide 30% relief on the increased interest costs relative to June last year, and capped at total relief of €1,500 per qualified household. It would exclude second and holiday homes, and rental properties held by landlords. The Minister's party leader spoke about how he gets letters in this regard all the time. As we know, landlords can get 100% tax relief. The Fine Gael Government increased it from 80% to 100%, so this excludes landlords. This measure is a shock absorber for those households that face difficulties in the months ahead. It is targeted. It would absorb a portion of increased interest costs. It is affordable, sensible and necessary.  Following our work with the PBO, we estimate the proposal would cost between €350 million and €400 million. Why is there a range? It is because none of us can be 100% sure where interest rates are going. The higher end of this range, for example, is that fixed rates would increase by 1.5% compared to June last year. Standard variable rates would increase across the board by 3%. We know this is not anywhere near what is happening. We have, therefore, built potential significant increases for fluctuations for the remainder of this year. This is a measure that would last for the next 12 months. It is one that is sensible, targeted and time limited. Crucially, it is an initiative that would give support to individuals now. I mentioned Rachel earlier. The Minister just ignored that point in trying to deflect in silly numbers to the effect that everybody would get €1,500. Let us bring this back to the individuals. Rachel is a carer with a child with cerebral palsy. Her mortgage type has meant an increase of €400 per month. This is before this month's increase has been passed on to her. She will then face the March increase. Such individuals are looking for the Government to support them now. They are looking for the Government to do the right thing.  We put it to the Government last year to consider bringing forward a proposal. If it had come forward with a proposal to cap a relief at €1,300, that would have been grand. We would have asked to discuss it. The Government could equally have suggested that the measure should have not kick in until the interest rate was above 3%, and we would have said, "Let us do that." Sinn Féin, though, has undertaken work that did not happen overnight and that has been going on for months with the PBO. The party has its information from the Central Bank concerning performing and non-performing loans. I can give the Minister examples in this regard. If fixed rates increased by 1.5%, the cost would be €36.5 million. For non-performing loans with the five banks, it would be €450,000. If standard variable rates went up by 3%, the outlay would be €136.4 million. If tracker rates were at 3.5%, it would be €175 million for performing loans and €7.81 million for non-performing loans. The PBO has done all this work. If the Government, however, wants to have a silly debate about the costings of this proposal or question the independence or assumptions of the PBO, that is fine. However, I would like to talk about Rachel and others who have come to me and said they are mortgage prisoners. They are asking us how they will pay a mortgage at a rate of 7.5% or 8%. In emails, they are asking me where they are supposed to get the money to pay the €4,500 to €5,000 extra they will have to pay this year compared to last year. I know that if I were the Minister for Finance, I would not be able to take that weight completely off those people. We are not suggesting that the State absorb that entire interest rate increase. We are recognising, though, that the primary factor driving inflation in Europe is the war in Ukraine. Measures have been introduced that have upset some of the worst impacts of inflation, and rightly so. This is another issue. These families need to be supported and protected. For the next 12 months, therefore, it is a sensible proposal to have an interest rate relief of 30% of the increased mortgage levels being paid by customers, with reference to the rate from June last year, and with no mortgage holder benefiting by more than a total of €1,500. As I said, the range in the cost is from €350 million to €400 million. The banks should not pass on all these increases and, in fairness to them, they have not been doing so. Equally, however, if they did not pass on this 3%, the total cost would not be anywhere near these figures. It would be less again. The point here is to be focused and centred. I know the Acting Chair will agree with us because he has made these points on many occasions. We need to focus on those who are struggling with mortgage arrears. From the Government, I have heard no solution, plan or anything else. Talking about the Central Bank and solutions involving improving regulation do not cut it. These vulture funds do not offer fixed rates or switching. In many circumstances, they do not offer alternative arrangements. The only thing the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears needs to do is make sure they go through the suite of measures they offer. If they do not offer at option, people are in dire straits. This is why the Government needs to step in. I commend the motion to the House.

The practice of successive Governments from the 1970s to the 1990s was to deny disability allowance payments to those in institutional care. This affected thousands of people in up to 140 institutional care homes. It has been estimated that somewhere between 4,000 and 10,000 people were affected during the period in which this payment was made by the Department of Health and another 2,700 after the then Department of Social and Family Affairs took over the payment. Many of these people had profound disabilities and relied on the State to care for them and to advocate on their behalf. Instead of advocating for these people, the strategy of successive Governments has been to conceal, deny, cover up and delay rather than protecting these citizens, who were often extremely vulnerable. It was a callous and calculated strategy to deny the most vulnerable their rights and one of paying up for those with the resources to take legal action and to punch down against those who did not. As shocking as these revelations are, they should not come as too big a surprise if we consider the other scandals in which successive Governments down through the years have tried to deny people rights by concealing information and settling on the steps of the court. I think of those affected by thalidomide, sodium valproate, the CervicalCheck scandal, the mother and baby home redress scheme and, of course, the nursing home fees. A Government memo from 1997 estimated that claims from those affected could cost €350 million to €700 million before legal costs were taken into account. In 2006, a case was taken on behalf of a woman who had been receiving a disability payment prior to her admittance to a psychiatric facility in 1983. That payment was stopped within weeks of her being admitted. The case centred on the claim that the regulations that led to the discontinuation of her disability allowance payment were in conflict with the law and ultra vires and that they had no legal standing as a result. The case was settled in 2008. If, as the current Attorney General concluded yesterday, the State had no positive legal duty to make retrospective payments in respect of the disabled persons maintenance allowance, why were this case and others settled by the State? A further joint memo for Cabinet was prepared in 2009 by the then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, and the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Hanafin, which assessed the potential implications of the case. Two members of the current Cabinet were also members of Cabinet when this memo was prepared and brought forward for discussion, namely, Deputy Micheál Martin, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Deputy Eamon Ryan, then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Three other current Members from Government parties were also Ministers in 2009 when this memo was prepared for Cabinet, namely, Deputies O'Dea, Ó Cuív and Brendan Smith. Do they stand over the denial of these payments? Do they stand over the strategy to conceal, deny, cover up and delay rather than protecting vulnerable citizens? In 2011, when the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition was replaced by Fine Gael and Labour, another brief was prepared on this issue. In the Dáil last week, the Taoiseach said that the legal advice regarding the disability allowance suggested that the State did not have a leg to stand on. How does this square with the conclusions of the Attorney General? The Taoiseach is reported as having said that the Government will do "“whatever is legally required and morally just”. Will the Government do so now?

I genuinely thank the Deputy for raising this matter. At the outset, I will take the opportunity to set out the context for what is an extremely important issue which many people have become familiar with over recent days and weeks. The disabled persons maintenance allowance constituted a weekly allowance paid by health boards to persons who were unable to work by reason of a disability. The scheme was first introduced under the Health Act 1953 and remained under the responsibility of the Minister for Health, the health boards and the HSE for over 40 years. Responsibility for the payment and administration of this allowance transferred to what is now the Department of Social Protection in 1996. At that point, the disabled persons maintenance allowance was discontinued and replaced by disability allowance. I should clarify that the legal concerns around the operation of this payment primarily relate to the period before the scheme transferred to the Department in 1996. Furthermore, since 1999, people entering nursing homes have retained their entitlement to disability allowance and, since the start of 2007, eligibility to the full rate of disability allowance has been extended to all people in a care setting. As such, these issues are historical and relate to arrangements that have not been in place for many years. In response to public concerns, the Government asked the Attorney General to review the files in his office regarding charges levied for the provision of nursing home care and the non-payment of the disabled persons maintenance allowance to persons in residential care and to provide an account of the litigation management strategy adopted by the State insofar as it was based upon the legal advices provided by previous Attorneys General and the Office of the Attorney General. Yesterday, the Government noted the report from the Attorney General on these matters. The report is being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published. The report analyses the nature of the State's approach to civil litigation and provides an explanation of the litigation process. It considers the disabled persons maintenance allowance and the historical question of the legal authority to withhold payment of the allowance to persons in full-time residential care funded or part-funded by the State and litigation relating to non-payment of the allowance. It confirms that there was no positive legal duty to make retrospective payments. Yesterday, the Government asked the Ministers for Health and Social Protection, Deputies Donnelly and Humphreys, to consider the report and revert to Government within three months. As the Taoiseach said earlier, the two Ministers will look at the report in the round. There are a lot of documents to consider, some of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s, and that is why it is important that adequate time is given to consider the issues at hand. Furthermore, the report by the Attorney General will be discussed in the Dáil tomorrow by Members from all sides of the House and it will also be considered by the relevant Oireachtas committee. It is important that we do not provide mixed messages on this Government's support for people with disabilities. In budget 2023, a number of important supports were brought forward for people with disabilities, including: a cost-of-living double payment; a €500 cost-of-living disability support grant; a Christmas bonus double payment paid in December; an increase of €12 in weekly payments, with proportionate increases for qualified adults; and an increase of €20.50 in the domiciliary care allowance, which now amounts to €330 per month. These are just a few measures that build on a range of supports provided over successive budgets. I assure the House that the Government remains committed and ambitious in its support for people with disabilities.

The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, when speaking on "Morning Ireland" stated that the need to protect State resources had obscured the need to protect the vulnerable. He is reported as saying, "When the State is subject to legal actions, when it adopts legal positions, I think it's really important that those positions are influenced by the obligation that the State has to some of its most vulnerable citizens". That is the approach I urge the Government to adopt. I feel this is not about protecting public money. The State did not fight the church in court to get it to pay for all of the abuse it inflicted on children. It did not fight the suppliers of faulty cement blocks or the builders of shoddy apartments for their mistakes, or negligence, as I should say. It did not make them pay. The taxpayers shouldered the burden in those instances. The State will not make the strong pay but, if you are vulnerable or poor, you are deceived and robbed. This State signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in 2018. We should be bound by the commitments within that convention. I hope that the two Ministers will be guided by its contents as they carry out their review. I will speak on some of the convention's articles. Article 12 states that persons with disabilities should be given "the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity." Article 13 states that states parties should "ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others". People with disabilities also have a right to information. Article 23 specifies that people with disabilities have the right "to social protection and to the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of disability" and that the State "shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of this right". That was denied to the people in question. I know the UNCRPD was only signed in 2018. Now that we have signed and ratified it, we have an obligation to live up to these commitments.

It is important to note, as the Attorney General points out in his report, that it is sometimes tempting to resort to generic stereotypes about the State being in some way unfair to its citizens when they are deprived of a benefit and bring legal proceedings challenging this deprivation, and that the logic behind such a perspective suggests that the State has unlimited resources, must concede every court case that is brought against it and must fund every claim for compensation or redress that is demanded of it. The fact that citizens have a legal entitlement to challenge decisions of the State before our independent Judiciary does not imply that all of those challenges are well-founded or that the State is not entitled to defend itself against legal challenge.Governments must make hard choices all the time with finite resources, and the requirement to defend litigation that seeks to challenge those choices inevitably follows. It is important to once again emphasise that these issues are historical. Over the period from 1999 to 2007, entitlement to full disability allowance was gradually extended by the Government of the time to people resident in institutional care settings. This shows that successive Governments sought to expand access and funding in a progressive manner. The track record of the Government over recent budgets shows that we have taken concrete steps to support people with disabilities. I assure the House that this remains a firm Government priority. The Ministers for Health and Social Protection will now consider the report and revert to the Government within three months. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and look forward to engaging further with her and others on this issue in due course.

It was launched this day last week in Smock Alley Theatre. It was fantastic to see so many young artists there doing exactly what young artists should, expressing themselves, finding meaning and making art. The report provides a clear-eyed overview of the current context in the youth arts. While it fully acknowledges the increased levels of funding being made available to the arts sector under this Government, it still echoes in its introduction the finding of the National Youth Council of Ireland that the youth arts sector is still working with inadequate, inconsistent and piecemeal funding for youth arts provision set within an under-resourced youth work sector. The report prompts us to ask what we are talking about when we talk about youth arts. Among its 19 findings, the report states that national policy is distributed across many policy sites and Departments and each Department has priorities and outcomes peculiar to itself. Consequently, youth arts as a stand-alone practice can fall between policy cracks. Youth arts is treated as an input into other policy objectives and not a sector in its own right. There is little priority given at a national level to the idea of young people as artists. The emphasis falls on personal, social and economic outcomes. Funding enters the sector from multiple sources, with different criteria. Funding is increasingly outcome-driven as opposed to rights-based, with a particular emphasis on improvements in individual well-being and tending towards targeted as opposed to universal provision and access. Is it the case that we think youth arts should do something in order to earn its crust? It certainly can be useful to help resolve issues like social inclusion or to explore mental health difficulties. Surely youth arts also has to be a space in which there are no objectives other than for young people to have the space to make art. Chief among its ten recommendations, the report argues that the national strategic youth organisations and those working in the delivery of youth arts must collaborate on a framework national youth arts policy, built on a sector-wide agreed definition of youth arts and a vision for the development of youth arts. Are there plans afoot in the Department to do that? I want to finish on the words of Mary, who helped launch this report. She states:My mother signed me up for creative writing classes with Waterford Youth Arts when I was thirteen, and I hated her for it. My words were mine. I didn’t want someone to read my words and tell me that they were wrong. I didn’t want anyone telling me what to do with my words, or what to do at all. My mother signed me up for creative writing classes and it was one of the most influential moments of my life. It took a while, but when I shared my words, I found that there were no harsh critiques, there was no scorn, no side eye glances at the weird sideways girl. I am the person I am today because of youth arts. It isn’t simply a youth club, or a school play, or some handmade posters on a wall. Youth arts is a living breathing thing. It fosters and nurtures creative self-expression, which in turn nurtures a young person into a young adult. I know I still have a lot to learn about life and myself even. But, having grown up as a veteran of youth arts, I’m not the weird sideways girl I used to be. I’m confident, and I’m brave, and I have the strength to follow the path I’ve chosen for my life, winding and bumpy as all life paths turn out to be.Really, what more should we ask than that? We should be less focused on objectives and outcomes and more focused, in a coherent way, on creating a space where young people can authentically express themselves.

I am responding on behalf of his party colleague and my constituency colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin. I was very touched by the Deputy's contribution and I am very well aware that this is a personal passion of his as well as something he is bringing forward on behalf of his constituents. The Deputy notes the local authorities and counties that came together in order to commission this report together with Creative Ireland Waterford and facilitated by Waterford Youth Arts. It was also funded under the Arts Council's collaboration scheme. The Deputy knows better than anybody else that Waterford Youth Arts has a long track record in this area. This report is an interesting example of a multidisciplinary youth arts hub or resource in their local area. A particular highlight in recent years has been The Lit, a youth-led literature festival which has been funded via Waterford Youth Arts annual programme of activities. The Deputy's expression and his emphasis on the importance of creative writing and being able to give people the space to develop that are well made. I also understand that this organisation has made incredible efforts to structure its youth arts programme and to support its young members. This report by John O'Brien is very timely indeed. The research report studies youth arts policy at a national level and it builds on previous work commissioned by Youth Arts Now regarding youth arts. It is interesting to see the mapping of funding going into youth arts and to note the obstacles faced by these youth organisations. The report contains a number of interesting case studies and, most importantly, makes a number of recommendations which will no doubt contribute to the debate about the future of youth arts in Ireland. Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council has primary responsibility for the development of the arts in Ireland. The council works under its ten-year strategy to address its statutory remit through a policy-driven focus on investment, advice, advocacy and partnership including investment in the traditional arts. The Arts Council offers a wide range of financial supports including for young people, children and education. The Deputy will be interested to note that with the Government's recent support to extend the Creative Ireland programme for the period 2023 to 2027, the Minister will be bringing a new Creative Youth plan to Government for agreement. This will be along with her Cabinet colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Foley, O'Gorman and Harris. Like its predecessor, the plan will operate across formal education and training settings and the wider community, and will provide further support for professional development. The first Creative Youth plan provided a collaborative framework to enable the creative potential of children and young people. Since 2017, over 2,000 schools and Youthreach centres have had the opportunity to enrich their school's creativity through programmes such as Creative Schools and Creative Clusters. Educators such as the Deputy have been supported to embed creativity into their professional teaching practice. Access to programmes such as creative writing, youth drama and creative technology has expanded in communities. Local Creative Youth partnerships have been established in six education and training boards, prioritising provision for seldom heard children and young people in their locality. Under the Creative Communities initiative, I understand that the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, provides funding to each of the 31 local authorities to support culture and creativity teams to implement their individual culture and creativity strategies. These teams also deliver Cruinniú na nÓg, the flagship national day of free creative activities for children and young people. To date, over 2,800 events have taken place in partnership with all 31 local authorities. For example, 20 events were held across Waterford last year. The next Cruinniú na nÓg is scheduled to be held on 10 June this year where many more children will get to participate in this national day of free creative activity for young people. I underline the importance of letting children expand their own creative horizons. I fundamentally believe that should be the main focus of this and I know my belief is shared by Government colleagues. The end goal is to get as many people involved and doing what they love in a space that they find is comfortable for them to truly express themselves.

This has to be about facilitating children and young people and having that space to make art. Just in listening to the reply, however, we heard references to the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in its local government aspect.When I first entered politics, I was given some advice by former Deputy Trevor Sargent. He told me that one of the main challenges was to get a Minister to put his or her name to a proposal to avoid it being bounced around from Department to Department. The report reads:Funding tends to be small, project focused and not guaranteed across time, creating a dependency on volunteerism ... at the point of delivery. This level of funding [on a short-term basis] positions youth arts as a non-professional practice outside of the area of state responsibility [and essentially being bounced from pillar to post in terms of funding].The Minister of State mentioned how Waterford Youth Arts had been in the business for a long time. Ms Breda Murphy and Mr. Ollie Breslin have been involved in it for probably more years than they would care to admit. However, instead of focusing on arts practice and fostering the artistic expression of young people, a large part of the job is chasing money from pillar to post. We need to be more coherent in bringing everything together and making it a reliable job for the people involved. It might be the first time the Minister of State is hearing this, but the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is probably sick to death of hearing about how we are developing a framework for progressing well-being budgeting. I have been arguing consistently that we should have a 12th indicator that measures arts, culture, language, etc. Through such a framework, perhaps we could enhance our understanding and appreciation of what arts can do within our society.

It is important to assure the House that the Government is committed to youth arts, particularly in the context of Creative Youth, which is one of five pillars of the Creative Ireland programme. Creative Youth is being implemented by, and is focused through, the Department of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. She is the Minister putting her name to it. However, the Deputy will appreciate that this is being done through partnerships. Be it in the formal education setting or the wider community setting, there must be buy-in by Departments, their agencies and local authorities. We cannot restrict this to one field. It cannot just be for people who are of school-going age, are within the formal education sector or have decided to proceed with a creative arts vocation. This is something that should be for every young person if he or she so chooses or, as in the case cited by the Deputy, if his or her parents so choose. He and I shared a video a couple of weeks ago of my son's attempt at creative art not long beforehand as part of junior infants. That was not necessarily something he wanted to be a part of, but it was the first thing he talked about when he came home. He is still singing about penguins. I hope he continues doing so, be it in the formalised education sector or more widely. I take seriously the Deputy's points about the frustration of those who are entrusted to develop and deliver youth arts. We must ensure that they can make a career or living out of it. I will bring all of the Deputy's concerns to the Minister. She is well versed in the Deputy's opinions on the indicators. This is one that merits deep consideration. I will bring it to the Minister and other Government colleagues in due course.

Anyone with an understanding of the sector will agree on those benefits. In recent years, this House has spent a great deal of time debating emissions reductions and our battle against climate change. I have been a stout defender of the agrifood industry. While we must face up to the reality of climate change, we cannot hinder our ability to produce food sustainably. We must be able to protect our production base. We have an emissions reduction target of 25%. Research shows that genotyping can play a large part in achieving that reduction. The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, has conducted a great deal of research into this matter, as have other bodies. It is estimated that we could reduce our emissions by 10% by genotyping our national herd. That would go a long way towards meeting the targets to which we have committed. How could such a reduction be achieved? Just before Christmas, I was on a research farm with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It was run by a meat processor. We were shown animals that were fed the same, born roughly at the same time and were at the point of being ready for slaughter. On average, there was a difference of 120 kg liveweight between one bull and another. If we can get that genetic improvement into our beef animals with the same feeding, same carbon footprint and so on, it will have a major impact on reducing our emissions. The same would be true in dairy, where cows with the same feeding could produce extra kilograms of protein and butterfat. This could be of significant benefit. One upside of this increased efficiency is that it could bring economic gains for the farmer. We would also be the first country to do this with our national herd, which would give us a significant advantage in the marketplace. Having emission-efficient animals and being able to show that we were producing food sustainably would help our green image. By genotyping our herd, we could tailor our breeding to make vast improvements as well as significant reductions in our emissions. This will not be an easy task. I urge the Minister to make decisions on the matter quickly. Genotyping the herd will be a physical job. Doing the adult bovine population will take time. Even if we started soon, we would only get 50% of the herd done this year. It will cost money as well, which needs to be committed to, but it would be money well spent. There will be other debates in the House about climate change and some of us will argue different approaches to it, but whether one is the staunchest environmentalist or a staunch defender of the agrifood industry, genotyping the national herd ticks all the boxes. We can protect our production base and reduce our emissions. To paraphrase a TV sitcom, everyone would be a winner.

As the Deputy knows, this is a matter that I have spoken on recently. I have outlined clearly that it is my ambition to ensure that Ireland's is the first beef herd in the world to be fully genotyped. I look forward to taking steps towards that and ensuring we can deliver on it. Food Vision 2030 is our ten-year strategy for the sustainable development of the agriculture and food sectors. It is our lighthouse policy. Under it, I established two groups - the dairy Food Vision group and the beef and sheep Food Vision group - to advise on how we can meet our 25% emissions reduction target by 2030. In terms of contributing to that, one of the key measures that the groups agreed and advised on was the development of methane-mitigating breeding strategies to build efficiency traits. The key initial component that would be needed to underpin these breeding strategies is a national genotyping strategy. Genotyping the national herd, and acting effectively in response to the information gathered from that, has the potential to impact positively on farmers' economic and environmental sustainability. Traditionally, the genetic improvement of farmed livestock has been based on the use of data collected on animals in the breeding programme, namely, identification, ancestry and animal performance. Since 2009, this has been increasingly complemented by the addition of genomic, or DNA profile, data.Through having precise knowledge of the DNA markers associated with the genotype of each animal, livestock breeders can increase the accuracy of selection for traits of interest for both dairy and meat productivity and quality and more recently, methane output. This can result in an almost doubling of the rates of genetic gain achievable, compared to conventional breeding programmes. In addition to improving economic and environmental sustainability, genotyping the national herd would have a number of co-benefits, including providing a unique selling point in terms of traceability, which is important for marketing our quality produce; and providing greater certainty about the quality of dairy beef calves, with benefits both for the farmers rearing those calves and for calf health and welfare. In Ireland we are well placed to develop work in this area. Currently, Ireland has a relatively high level of genotyping when compared to other countries through innovative programmes such as the beef data and genomics programme and the soon-to-be-launched suckler carbon efficiency programme. Work undertaken by Teagasc and the ICBF has highlighted the significant benefits that can accrue to Irish farmers and related industries with higher genetic merit herds being more profitable and with a lower carbon footprint than lower genetic merit herds.  I am cognisant of and welcome the strong support of all stakeholders for genotyping of the national cattle herd. My ambition is that Ireland will become the first country in the world to genotype all livestock in the country. I want this to happen, I am determined that it will happen and I believe it will happen. By delivering it, we will continue to show the world that Ireland is more than an outpost on the edge of Europe. We will show that Ireland is a leader worldwide in our beef product. We are leaders and pioneers. We have a beef sector that is the envy of the world. As the Deputy is aware, the starting point in all of this is the farmer who calves the cow, rears the calf, produces the weanling or store and ultimately, finishes the animal. I am considering with my team how this might be achieved, having regard to the funding that will be necessary, the climate impact and a variety of organisational and logistical challenges. We can only do this if we are satisfied that it will lead to a real and measurable reduction in emissions and productivity. The Department and I will continue to engage with these stakeholders with a view to fleshing out and taking forward these proposals. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter today, and for his strong advocacy for this as a strategy and a way forward for our beef industry.

I think we are in full agreement on the huge benefits of genotyping our national herd. The accurate information that will be generated will have huge benefits for us. However, with respect, I want to emphasise that this is urgent and we need to get it moving as quickly as possible. It is estimated that Exchequer funding of €40 million to €45 million will be required to genotype the adult herd, alongside an ongoing expense each year on genotyping newborn calves. To me, it is too good an opportunity to let it pass us by. I fully accept that the Minister has no intention of allowing that to happen. I urge him, with all haste, to get this up and going. As I said in my initial statement, it is going to be a physical job to genotype the adult herd. According to the ICBF estimate, even if we started on 1 March we would only get 50% of the adult herd done this year. In order to get this up and running and to gain the benefits from it, we need to commit to starting as quickly as possible. I think we will get huge buy-in from farmers for the scheme. As I said, it ticks all the boxes. It will help us to meet our climate change targets and it will also deliver economic benefits to the farmer. I have always clearly stated that in my view, proper use of technology and the modern advances that are there can actually benefit us environmentally and economically at farm level. That is something that I have very strongly advocated for. This is an ideal vehicle to achieve that. The money that we spend on a 10% reduction in our emissions will be a small price to pay for that significant reduction.

Certainly, there is an urgency around this. I have outlined my ambition to make sure that Ireland is the first country in the world to have genotyped our full beef and livestock herd. That is something that I am now taking forward with my own Department and stakeholders. We are assessing and identifying the verifiable emissions reductions from doing that, and also the economic potential in relation to it. There is a serious job of work to be undertaken here. We are ahead of the curve in the extent to which we use genotyping currently through the various schemes I have outlined. We want to ensure that all animals are genotyped and that the benefits of that are felt by farmers in their productivity, profitability and sustainability. It has really exciting potential and can ensure that we remain at the cutting edge of the beef industry internationally and at a peak in relation to the sustainability of how we produce our beef. I look forward to working with the Deputy, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and with all stakeholders on how we can take this forward and ensure we can make it happen.

Unfortunately, I am raising the issue of Clifden District Hospital again. I am hoping the Minister of State might have some good news today. I doubt it, but I hope she does, because we are still in the same situation as we were previously. As the Minister of State is aware, my two colleagues raised the issue back in October when I was in the Chair. We did that as one voice. We had meetings with staff and the union. I will put it into context for the Minister of State. HIQA visited Clifden District Hospital in the middle of the Covid pandemic. Its conclusions on six measures were that the hospital was fully compliant on three of them, substantially compliant on two of them and partially compliant on one of them. That is a pretty good judgment from HIQA. It went on to point out that the feedback from the patients was positive. It noted some difficulties with the infrastructure. In particular, it was brought to the hospital's attention that there were not enough showers or enough showers geared towards gender, there was a lack of sinks and problems like that. Overall, the hospital got a thumbs-up from HIQA in the middle of Covid. Of the six measures, it was completely compliant on three measures, substantially complaint on two measures and partially compliant on one measure. The one that is was partially compliant was eminently in relation to-----

Everybody was glad in a sense, because it left more room for manoeuvre in relation to Covid. It is interesting that the report noted that the hospital accommodated patients requiring rehabilitation, convalescent and palliative care. The report stated that patients were admitted to Clifden District Hospital from University Hospital Galway. Inspectors were informed that admissions direct from the community to the hospital were stopped, but only because of Covid. Up to that point, there were referrals from the community and referrals from the hospital. I do not know where else the referrals were coming from. That is HIQA. Then there are the local doctors who the Minister of State is very familiar with. GPs do not often go out on a limb, do they? I know of a local GP, Dr. Casey, who has been there for 50 years and his son practises with him now. He has begged and implored the HSE to restore the hospital and the functions it had. I do not feel it is my place or that of the Minister of State to be in between unions and employers, but the nurses are saying that the HSE has orchestrated this downgrading of the hospital because they believe it wants it for another purpose that has not yet been revealed.If they do not advertise that they are open for business, they will not get the business. We have been given many contradictory reasons by the HSE on this. One reason is that it cannot get staff. It launched a special recruitment campaign and got more than 20 applications. A number of individuals were shortlisted. In the end, it got one nurse who will not be available until 2024. There is something seriously wrong. Am I over time?

I am taking this important matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has a dose of flu. I thank Deputy Connolly for raising it. I will begin by acknowledging the vital healthcare role that Clifden District Hospital plays and the excellent level of care and support which it provides to patients and their families in the Clifden community and surrounding areas. I assure Deputy Connolly that there are no plans to close Clifden District Hospital. However, we are aware of the various challenges that the facility is facing. I assure the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is committed to working alongside HSE Community Healthcare West to address these issues. As Deputy Connolly is aware, Clifden District Hospital has been primarily designated to provide convalescent step-down care to patients discharged from acute hospitals. It also provides respite beds to allow family carers in the community a welcome break. However, with the evolution of Sláintecare and the transition of care from acute to community settings, the need for these step-down beds has reduced. In the Clifden area, there have also been significant challenges over many years to secure sufficient nursing staff, despite national, international, and local recruitment drives. This is the case both in Clifden District Hospital and in St. Anne's Community Nursing Unit, a designated centre registered with HIQA to provide a home for older people. HSE Community healthcare west, in keeping with its commitments to political representatives, its staff, and their representatives, undertook a bespoke nurse recruitment process in October. At a minimum, four additional nurses are required to sustain the current residential older people services in both St. Anne's Community Nursing Unit and Clifden District Hospital. The HSE will continue to undertake bespoke campaigns to fill these vacancies but continues to face challenges filling these posts. HSE Community healthcare west has assured the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, that it will continue to review service needs and what services can be provided based on the available staffing. It will also continue to engage with staff, unions, GPs and political representatives in this regard. I would like to inform the Deputy that last November HSE Community Healthcare West met local GPs. The GP engagement involved an initial meeting with HSE management and a follow-up meeting with a consultant geriatrician. The consultant geriatrician outlined the integrated care programme for older persons, ICPOP, services being rolled out as part of the enhanced community care programme, including the visiting satellite clinics based in Clifden District Hospital. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was delighted to hear that the visiting clinic commenced last month with an expected monthly service from the consultant geriatrician and a twice monthly service from the ICPOP team, incorporating physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics and nursing. This is a welcome addition to services provided in Clifden District Hospital. The day service at Clifden District Hospital remains in operation, and a new bus service is available to those seeking to access it. HSE Community healthcare west is aiming to expand this service. It is important to highlight again that there are no plans to cease services or close Clifden District Hospital at present . The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will continue to engage with the chief officer in HSE Community healthcare west to ensure the continuation and possible expansion of services in Clifden. As a Minister of State who represents Galway, I would certainly like to see Clifden District Hospital remain in full operation. I give my full endorsement to its operation, knowing the geography of the county as I do. I can leave my house in Portumna and be in Leinster House quicker than I would ever be on the far side of Galway city. It is very important to understand the size of Galway and the geographical need. There is also the ageing population and the valuable role that Clifden District Hospital plays in the community.

I acknowledge positive comments she made and the information she put on the record. To put this in the context I will speak about the number of people on trolleys in a centre of excellence in Galway, although I have been corrected for calling it a centre of excellence because that is only with regard to cancer care. Nevertheless it serves an area of between 800,000 and 1 million people. There were 42 patients on trolleys there today. Clifden District Hospital closed over Christmas. It also closed in November because it had no staff or could not staff the nursing home. Staff are being moved back and forth. As I understand it, there is an ongoing dispute with the union on this. What I am most unhappy with is that the hospital has closed twice. This is in an area where it is vital as the Minister of State recognises. It is vital to take the pressure off the regional hospital. It is vital because of the elderly population, which is increasing as Dr. Casey has repeatedly pointed out. He has also pointed out the range of services that could be provided in Clifden to take the pressure off other hospitals. I worry when I hear that there are no plans to close Clifden District Hospital. It worries me how language is used when we get a little lecture on primary care and a geriatrician telling us the good things. We know this, and it is brilliant. I praised those involved when we had a meeting and learned about primary care on the ground. I worked in primary care. However, it is no substitute for a hospital that provides services. When I ask why services are not available in Carraroe or why there are no respite beds there I am told that they are in Clifden. Merlin Park is the primary place for respite beds, with 13. I am told that Clifden has 12 respite beds. I go around in circles with all of my pieces of paper. Even on the issue of respite beds alone there is a need for Clifden District Hospital based on the figures, not to mention for convalescence and other possible services that should be there.

I am aware the services provided in Clifden District Hospital are highly valued by the wider community and in older person services in HSE Community healthcare west. Unfortunately, short-stay capacity in public hospitals and community nursing units can be impacted for a number of reasons. These include HIQA. As Deputy Connolly said earlier, HIQA has found no fault in Clifden District Hospital. Short-stay capacity can also be impacted because of infection prevention and control and staffing challenges. As I have already outlined, we are very aware of the challenges that Clifden District Hospital faces. I advise Deputy Connolly that the HSE has assured the Department that it is committed to providing services to older people to meet the demands for short- and long-term services for people in Galway. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was delighted to hear the integrated care programme for older persons was launched at Clifden District Hospital last month. ICPOP services ensure that older people with complex care needs can access care quickly or near home through care pathways specifically designed for older people. They target frailty, falls and dementia. This is a welcome addition to the Clifden District Hospital. I assure the Deputy there are no plans to close Clifden District Hospital. I reiterate that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is fully committed to working alongside the HSE to ensure that services at Clifden District Hospital continue. I must compliment Breda Crehan-Roche on the work she does. If I were to lean on her, it would be in the context of saying that it is vital that the service stays open at all times. We cannot have an ad hoc approach whereby it opens and closes. We need to ensure the staffing, even if it is relief staff coming from community healthcare in the city, must be provided. We need a pragmatic approach to ensure that at all times Clifden District Hospital remains open and that the people in the community are reassured that the service is stable and responding to the needs.
