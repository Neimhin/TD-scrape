#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	0	This is the last opportunity we will have to ask questions to the Leader until the Dáil resumes after the recess.Yesterday I raised the matter of welfare cuts being applied to the blind, carers and the disabled.  The total saving is €108 million.  The Taoiseach responded by stating expenditure on social welfare was more than €20 billion and that it was necessary to reduce expenditure by €4 billion this year.  He made the point that it is very easy for Opposition parties to put forward the view that all such cuts are easy.  I have never put forward the proposition that it is easy to make cuts.What is happening is that, for the first time in 80 years, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has become the victimiser of victims in that the poorest of the poor are being hit.  I received a telephone call this morning from a blind man who told me this is the first time the question of blind people was raised in the House in this context.  He also stated the allowance for the training of guide dogs is being cut.This is the last week before Christmas.  The Taoiseach set up the McCarthy group to determine where cuts could be made in the public sector.  Fine Gael accepted quite a few of its recommendations.  It recommended cuts in administrative expenditure in the Department of the Taoiseach in the order of €17.5 million.  It recommended administrative cuts of €88 million in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, €82.8 million in the Department of Finance, €432 million in the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive and €6 million in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  These cuts are not easy to make because they require direct negotiation with the people involved, including back-office staff and administrators.I have picked the five aforementioned Departments because they demonstrate clearly the administrative cuts recommended by the body the Taoiseach set up.  The Taoiseach stated quite rightly yesterday that budgets are about choices.  None of them is easy but there is only one correct option when choosing between administrative cuts in any of the five Departments, or in a number of Departments, with a view to making cuts of €108 million, and cuts to the benefits of those who are caring for their loved ones, those who are means-tested for the blind person's pension, and the disabled.  The Taoiseach should protect those who are absolutely vulnerable and the poorest of the poor.With regard to the five Departments, what administrative costs were accepted by the Government arising from the McCarthy recommendations?  The Taoiseach set up the McCarthy group.  He considered its recommendations and chose the option of cutting the benefits of the blind, carers and the disabled.

All expenditure must be reduced and it is being reduced.  The administrative budgets are multi-annual, as the Deputy knows.  Over the three years of the budgets we will seek to reduce administrative budgets along the lines suggested.  We started this process this year.  It is not a question of "either or".  All areas of expenditure, including social welfare——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Therefore, I do not accept the contention that it is a choice between one and the other.  We will still have a deficit of €18.8 billion and an Exchequer borrowing requirement next year.   The Deputy's proposal that we can sustain social welfare provision at €22 billion in the present circumstances is not an option.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It must be said candidly to the people that it is not an option.

I made no such contention.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	10	What is the Deputy saying?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It is a question of choice for the Taoiseach and I contend he made the wrong choice.  The way one should attack the welfare issue first is to stimulate employment so that many of the 427,000 people on the live register will be taken off it and return to work.  Thus, we will be able to trade our way out of difficulty.  The Taoiseach did not adopt this approach in his budget.I have chosen three areas in the welfare budget as we approach the end of this year.  These areas concern carers, the blind and disabled.  I am not suggesting one should maintain a social welfare budget of €22 billion because one can reduce that if one provides work.  Arising from the recommendations of the McCarthy group, which the Taoiseach established to make such recommendations to him and his colleagues, he made certain choices.  With regard to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including FÁS, in respect of which Department the group recommended administrative cuts of €88 million, the Taoiseach decided to make no administrative cut.  Despite all the scandals about overpayments, golden handshakes, superior pensions and worldwide travel, the cut in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was nil.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	14	That is a choice the Taoiseach made based on a recommendation received by him from the McCarthy report.  He is looking for savings of €108 million out of a budget of €22 billion.  He could protect the blind, the disabled and the carers at this time of the year, a time when we are celebrating the Christian ethos we are supposed to have.There have been no cuts to the administrative budgets of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or Social and Family Affairs, a cut of €12 million in the Department of the Taoiseach, €62 million in the Department of Finance and €110 million in the Department of Health and Children.  These total €184 million out of a recommended €600 million in administrative cuts.  The Taoiseach could have quadrupled the savings in respect of what is required for the disabled, the carers and the blind but he did not do so.After he leaves the Chamber this morning, the Taoiseach should call his colleagues together and accept the Opposition's claim that there are options.  Savings of more than the €108 million in question would have been made if the Government implemented its anti-fraud measures properly or got rid of the quangos Fine Gael has pointed out.  If it took the administrative cuts recommended for several Departments, it would have made the savings to allow the blind, the disabled and the carers have some sense of Christian feeling from the Government.For the first time in 80 years a Government has not just made cuts but cut from the poorest of the poor.  It has cut from those who are means-tested, blind, disabled, those who are listening this morning knowing the Government has no intention but of doing them down.On the last Leaders' Questions for this year, will the Taoiseach go up to his office to give an instruction that these cuts in the allowances for the disabled, carers and the blind be reversed?  I have given him three opportunities as to how he can do so.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I have explained to Deputy Kenny that he is inaccurate in what he has claimed.  The administrative cut in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment amounted to €46 million.  I do not have the specific details but the idea there will be no cuts in administration is ridiculous.  I have explained to Deputy Kenny that the allocations referred to in the McCarthy report are multi-annual allocations for three years.The position the country is in requires the Government to look at all areas of expenditure.  We carefully considered any reductions in social welfare payments.  We ensured the 470,000 pensioners and the 450,000 children in low-income and welfare-dependent families would not be affected.  The Government sought everything it could.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	17	They have had cuts made before.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The McCarthy report recommended a 5% cut in all welfare rates.  The Government, however, did not go down that road.  It made a choice which seeks to maintain the real purchasing power of welfare payments against a background of a drop in the cost of living of 6.6% in 2009.I understand and acknowledge welfare rates, irrespective of whether the €8.30 has been removed, are not easy to live on.  In the interests of retaining the many hundreds of thousands of payments made every week and every year, the present position was not sustainable and adjustments had to be made.  The adjustment made in the particular heading of expenditure in question was less than the other adjustments made in capital, programme and public service pay expenditure.That was the choice facing the Government.  It had to make those choices in as carefully a calibrated way as possible.  I acknowledge people will receive a reduced rate of payment as a result.  However, we are doing so to keep a sustainable system going, not on the basis that there was some easy choice.  We have to come back to the fact that the country is spending far more than what it is taking in in revenues all the time.  If we do not address this position, we will have an even greater adjustment to have to contemplate than has been the case thus far.

At the time, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, expressed his disappointment.Since then, we have had a high profile Garda raid on the bank and have been told the Director of Corporate Enforcement is doing some kind of an investigation.  However, no one has been called to book for what happened in the bank.Since then, too, Anglo Irish Bank has been nationalised.  Some €4 billion of taxpayers' money has been put into it while another €7 billion has been put into AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Between them, it comes to €11,000 million of taxpayers' money.  It is the largest bank robbery ever, except on this occasion it is the banks robbing the people.Despite this, the banks are still not lending to business as they should be.  This year, the Taoiseach is marking the anniversary of Mr. FitzPatrick's resignation by cutting the pay of the lowest paid workers in the public service and the welfare allowances to the blind, the disabled and carers.  Yesterday, the new Governor of the Central Bank expressed the opinion there should be a 9/11 style inquiry set up to examine what happened in the banks, why it was allowed to happen and who had responsibility.  Does the Taoiseach accept this call for a 9/11 style inquiry into the banks?  If so, will he come back to the House in the new year with the proposals from the Government for the establishment of such an inquiry?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I read in this morning's newspaper about what the Governor of the Central Bank said to an Oireachtas committee.  From my point of view, the resources of the State are currently involved in ensuring banking stability and that we can deal with the economic and financial issues that arise.  I am sure there will be economic historians and economists who will continue to talk about the failure of the regulatory system in this and other countries regarding the challenge faced by us.However, I would have to carefully consider such an inquiry before giving any commitment.  As we know from the Abbeylara case, there are limitations on Oireachtas committees being able to inquire into questions of fact.  There is also the question of other established inquires which are still ongoing and to what extent they have been able to deal with the issues in a timely fashion that does not undermine but maintains confidence in our banking system.  This initiative would have to be carefully considered.

It is not the resources of the State that are dealing with the banking situation; it is the people's money.

He makes it sound as if the call made yesterday by the Governor of the Central Bank was from some disinterested economist writing in some obscure journal.  This is the Governor of the Central Bank who was appointed by the Taoiseach's Government to oversee the banks.

He is not the first to do so.  When the Taoiseach first came into the House with his bank guarantee idea, the Labour Party proposed the sending in of an inspector to the banks.  We proposed an oversight committee for NAMA.  Mr. Colm McCarthy, highly favoured on the Taoiseach's side of the House, proposed there should be a DIRT-style inquiry.  There were suggestions there would be some kind of a parliamentary investigation.  The word on the grapevine, however, is that the Taoiseach himself blocked the holding of a parliamentary investigation into the banking situation.

I agree that our intertwined national histories, most especially in the modern era, have left a tremendous number of items relating to Ireland and of significant historical interest in official and private collections throughout Britain and Ireland.  The priority considerations in respect of such material must be towards preservation and, where possible, public access.Although some might wish that every significant artefact of our national heritage could be included among the Irish national collections, I am satisfied with the cordial relations that permit artefacts to be moved on loan between collections from time to time for special exhibition purposes.The issues raised by the Deputy relating to the provenance and acquisition of items in collections and archives are specific to each case and cannot be addressed as a totality.

I recently inquired about the Roger Casement artefacts, many of which were confiscated by the British in raids on his flat in 1914.  These artefacts were never used in a subsequent court case and are not, therefore, part of the courts service and should be returned to his family.  A volume of material relating to Ireland remains in the possession of the British.  I ask the Taoiseach to request the British Prime Minister to have undertaken a trawl of the public records office, the courts service or its equivalent in Britain, and the British museum for material which was confiscated or stolen during various raids in Ireland, in particular during the modern period of the last century.An example would be documents used in court cases against Eamon de Valera, the founder of Fianna Fáil and former Sinn Féin leader.  It was said at the time that what was taken was seditious material.  However, a number of documents taken when IRA volunteers or Sinn Féin members were arrested in the 1916-1923 period were not subsequently used and should be returned to the families concerned or to this State.  Given our plans to roll out a commemoration of that period, these artefacts would be useful in terms of our preparations in this regard.

There are various conventions in place in respect of such matters.  We have not yet ratified the two main conventions in this area.  The general scheme of the monuments Bill, which is in the process of being submitted to Government by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, contains heads in regard to the ratification of those two conventions.  The property rights of families and individuals must be respected.  Where property rightly belongs to a person or family, Governments must respect this, and where there are artefacts in cultural or other institutions abroad, it is open to our national cultural institutions to seek material for exhibition purposes.  The London Metropolitan Police will provide on loan to the National Museum some time after Christmas a sword belonging to Roger Casement.  These loans are made on the basis that the property will be returned.The Deputy has mentioned some specific items.  If there are other specific items he has in mind, I will arrange for the relevant national cultural institution to respond directly to him.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 10, inclusive, together.I attended the 13th Summit of the British-Irish Council, BIC, in Jersey on Friday 13 November last.  The meeting was hosted by the Chief Minister of Jersey, Mr. Terry la Sueur, and was attended by BIC Heads of Administration, including Mr. Peter Hain, Secretary of State for Wales; Mr. Alex Salmond, Scottish First Minister; Mr. Rhodri Morgan, Welsh First Minister; and the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Robinson and Mr. Martin McGuinness.Issues for discussion included the economic situation and steps that Administrations are taking to address the difficulties we are all facing, language issues and how all eight Administrations deal with the issue of lesser used languages and the steps they are taking to promote and preserve language in their jurisdictions, the location of a Standing Secretariat of the Council and renewable energy matters.  The next BIC summit will take place in Guernsey in June of next year.While attending the British-Irish Council, I took the opportunity to have bilateral meetings with First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness.  Our discussions focused on the devolution of policing and justice, the process that was under way and the need for early progress.  I also subsequently met on Saturday, 28 November with Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, to discuss these matters further.  I met with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, on Monday 30 November to discuss progress in Northern Ireland.  Both Governments are agreed on the importance of the full implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrew's Agreements and firmly believe that the early completion of the devolution of policing and justice is necessary to consolidate the functioning of the devolved institutions and to complete the transformation of policing in Northern Ireland.  This is an essential part of the St. Andrews Agreement, which is the basis on which all parties have moved forward.  It is a serious issue and one which must be resolved in the coming weeks.   The Prime Minister, Mr. Brown, and I are available to help, but the parties must also work to secure the necessary progress.I met with Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, MLA, leader of the SDLP, on Monday last when we discussed these issues.  I met with Sir Reg Empey, MLA, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, on 11 November for discussions also.The Minister for Foreign Affairs continues to meet with the Secretary of State on a regular basis.  They met again last night and our officials are also in regular contact.  I met with the British Prime Minister at the European Council on Thursday, 10 December last.  I will also see the Prime Minister again in Copenhagen later this week.I also met with the First and Deputy First Ministers at the ninth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council which took place on Monday last in Limavady.  At the meeting we had detailed discussions on the economic situation and how North-South co-operation can play its part in economic recovery, in particular, how we can develop co-operation in the delivery of public services, to develop efficiencies and improve services.The Minister for Finance updated our Northern colleagues on the establishment of NAMA.  We had positive engagement on all sides on a range of North-South items.  In particular, the NSMC welcomed continued progress on roads, with the Dublin to Belfast road to be completed on schedule next year and contracts now awarded on the north-west route.I reported on the first North-South consultative conference held in October last.  The plenary noted that there would be a follow-up event in the spring.The Council welcomed the agreement by the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly to hold a North-South parliamentary conference.  The Council also welcomed the Government's decision to lift the pause on capital funding for the Middletown Centre for Autism.  The Council looked forward to the commencement of interim capital works on site in Middletown consistent with the development plan as soon as possible.While in the north west I met with members of the Bloody Sunday Trust to discuss issues around the publication of the Saville report into the events of Bloody Sunday, which is expected in the coming months.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Those who have been following the Northern Ireland situation would have been struck by the meeting which the Taoiseach had in the past couple of days with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and with the quite public manifestation at that meeting, or at least the public part of it, of the bad relationship, which seems to exist between the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and which would appear to have been in existence for some time, and which, in turn, appears to be affecting the workings of the Executive in Northern Ireland.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about the deterioration in that relationship?  What work is being done to improve matters?When, in October, I asked the Taoiseach about the devolution of policing, which is the central political issue that must be resolved, he expressed the hope that matters on the devolution of policing could be progressed fairly quickly.  There still seems to be a serious stand-off over the devolution of policing.  We all had expected around the time the financial package for Northern Ireland was announced by the British Prime Minister that the devolution of policing would follow quickly from it and there has been some surprise that has not happened.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House what progress he expects will be made to ensure that the devolution of policing and justice matters is proceeded with reasonably quickly?Is the Taoiseach concerned that if this does not get resolved reasonably quickly we will be in to the short run-down to the Westminster elections, which may have an impact on what is happening?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I remain hopeful that it will be possible to see the implementation of the remaining aspects of the St. Andrews Agreement, including the question of devolution of policing and justice.  It is in that context that these outstanding matters need to be addressed.  I agree there is great urgency to be attached to it.  The stability and focusing of the institutions require that all aspects of what was agreed be implemented.Much work has been ongoing over a period of time regarding various steps that were being taken on a range of items relating to the policing and justice devolution issue.  I believe that all parties are committed to the devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland and both Governments are seeking to facilitate the taking of the decisions and the putting of the questions at the Assembly that would enable these matters to be finalised.As Deputy Gilmore stated, there have been stated positions publicly put by various parties on this issue.  It is an important issue but it is not the only issue.  The Government will continue to press for a successful outcome to the ongoing discussions.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The Taoiseach will also be aware that one of the issues which has caused concern north of the Border is the establishment of NAMA.  Were NAMA and its implications for Northern Ireland discussed at his meeting with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister?  Has the Government given any consideration to the possibility of appointing somebody from Northern Ireland with a Northern Ireland interest to the board of NAMA when it is established?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	69	That remains to be considered by the Government in respect of the composition of the board for the organisation.  This issue was raised at Farmleigh and three weeks ago at the NSMC.  There have been meetings at a bilateral level between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Mr. Sammy Wilson, MP, MLA, his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, who have had good amiable and constructive discussions explaining precisely how we see this operating.  Many concerns or initial worries that members of the Northern Ireland Executive may have had have been adequately dealt with as a result of those discussions.  There will be a continuing liaison between the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland for the purpose of ensuring people are in the loop as to how matters are progressing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Does the Taoiseach have any evidence that the theft of a number of ATM machines on this side of the Border is orchestrated by dissident republicans?  There would appear to be strong indications that such may well be the case.  Does he have any indication of that?Has any ongoing evidence been given to him in terms of security about the rise in the number of recruitments to dissident republican groups on this side of the Border?  This is a matter of growing concern.In that context, there are serious cuts in the drugs rehabilitation programmes throughout the country.  Clearly, the evidence from gardaí is that there are big moves afoot in terms of the drugs business.  This is something about which we must be very concerned.  Is that an issue he discussed in respect of cross-Border activities, surveillance and confiscation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	71	There is strong co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána on all of these matters in regard to individual incidents and any trends that may be emerging.  I understand there have been some developments on that front in recent days.This is a security matter where criminal activity is taking place.  There is a high degree of cross-Border co-operation at all levels.  The Deputy can be assured that in respect of that or any other issue where people are trying to engage in what is basically criminal activity, there is full co-operation between the police forces in both jurisdictions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, well in the discussions taking place at present.Is the Taoiseach hopeful, having discussed this with the British Prime Minister, that the devolution issue can be completed and that the matters of justice and policing can be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly?  He visited Northern Ireland in the past number of days.What is the position on the North-South parliamentary forum envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement?  Is it likely to be considered next year or if not, is it on the horizon?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Regarding the forum, we believe it should be set up by now.  Some months ago, we held a consultative meeting in Farmleigh with people from all parts of the island which went very well.  It is expected there will be a follow up there in March.  Mr. Trevor Ringland and Ms Mary Davis co-chaired it and it went very well.  I attended the meeting and I thought the interaction was very good.  There is a growing momentum behind this process which I wish to see resolved consistent with the Good Friday Agreement commitment.I refer to the matter of parliamentary contact or the forum.  I understand the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker held a very good meeting recently.  I welcome the fact that a parliamentary conference will be set up as a first step with the prospect of establishing a North-South inter-parliamentary group, which would also be very welcome.  The more contact there is between public representatives on the island, the greater the chance of identifying and driving a common agenda to the mutual benefit of everyone.  These issues are being pursued.I refer to the question of the role of the Governments in devolution and justice.  It should be stated that in all financial aspects the British Prime Minister has moved considerably to assuage any concerns people may have on that front.  It requires political will and leadership on everyone's part to ensure that this important and central objective of the peace process is achieved.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	74	In the course of his recent engagements with the British Prime Minister, was the Taoiseach made aware of the content or the text of a letter from the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, to Mr. Gordon Brown regarding his demand that the issues outstanding in respect of Orange Order parades and other issues should be a precondition for the resolution of the already agreed and funded transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the issue of the transfer of policing and justice powers is a very pressing one?  Would the Taoiseach also acknowledge that there is great concern across a significant section of political opinion not only north of the Border, but throughout the island of Ireland, that there is a demand to put in place further preconditions in advance of this essential development which, I expect, everyone in this House would wish to see at the earliest opportunity?  Is the Taoiseach aware of Sinn Féin's position in respect of the Orange Order parades, that is, we believe the resolution of contentious parades can only be achieved through direct dialogue between the Orange Order institution and local residents, and that this is the only means by which contentious parades can be successfully and, I hope, finally resolved?Would the Taoiseach agree that the overwhelming number of Orange Order parades annually present no issue for the wider Nationalist and republican community and pass off peacefully?  As an Irish republican, I recognise that the Orange Order and all that flows from it is a part of what we are as a nation throughout this island.  At the earliest opportunity, we urge direct dialogue in respect of the contentious parades not only with local communities, but between the so-called "loyal" institutions and Irish republicans.  I trust this will commence a dialogue that will, hopefully, lead to a better understanding and a better climate for engagement in the future.I refer to the other matter raised by the Taoiseach in his response to the questions tabled.  I call on him to confirm to the House again that the freeze on Government funding for the All Ireland Centre of Excellence for Autism at Middletown, County Armagh has indeed been lifted.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that a decision has been taken on the full restoration of the funding previously committed?  Will the Taoiseach indicate when further development of the centre will proceed?  When will that element of the work which had been signalled to take place or proceed in 2009 get under way?  When does the Taoiseach expect this will be completed?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I agree the question of devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland is a very pressing matter.  I agree it must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I agree a good deal of work has been done already which has engendered much public confidence in the process and the support of all sections of the community for devolved policing.  It is far preferable to have local public representatives in charge of these areas, those with whom people can interact and relate, rather than the current non-devolved status of those powers which is the case at present.  It should be possible to resolve these issues with good will and leadership on all sides.  There are a number of issues of concern to the two communities, obviously with different points of emphasis in each case.  However, all these matters can be progressed if there is sufficient good will on all sides.  Ultimately, there is a need for agreement to be reached among the parties themselves, quite apart from the Governments seeking to move people to agreement as quickly as possible.  This matter can and must be resolved and I trust the outcome of ongoing discussions will enable that to take place.I refer to the question of Middletown.  The Minister for Education and Science was in a position to inform the North-South Ministerial Council of the fact that he was lifting the pause on capital and that some interim works would be undertaken.  This was welcomed by everyone including the Deputy First Minister, who was very committed to the project when he served as education Minister.  We can envisage some developments there in the course of the coming year, consistent with the overall development plan outlined for it.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I refer to two matters related to the response of the Taoiseach.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the imperative of the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast, which as I have already stated has been agreed and to which funding has already been committed, should not face the further obstacle of new preconditions?  The proposition by the First Minister that the resolution of outstanding matters in respect of Orange Order parades should become a precondition is a wholly inappropriate and unacceptable further intrusion into what should have been a transfer that proceeded long before now and certainly before the end of this year.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there should be no further obstacles placed in the way of a successful transfer of these powers?  Will the Taoiseach clarify for the House if he was made aware of the content of the First Minister's correspondence during his recent engagements with the British Prime Minister or, indeed, by any other means prior to his recent meeting with both the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness?I refer again to the Centre of Excellence for Autism at Middletown.  The Taoiseach may not be able to provide the detail and I accept it might be the case that questions might be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Education and Science.  Nevertheless, will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the entirety of the commitment which had been, as the Taoiseach's word had it, "paused" during 2009 has now been "unpaused"?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Unpaused is a new word in the lexicon.  As to the Middletown project, work can begin this year.  There was a review of what was being looked at and everybody involved in the project is happy that progress will be made in the coming year.  In spite of the difficult financial situation, as a Government we were anxious to assist in the progression of that project in 2010, given the all-Ireland benefit that can be derived from it.  It is a further indication of the Government's commitment to move on these sorts of projects when we are in a position to have a clear view of where they are going.  I cannot be more specific other than to acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister for Education and Science in the Republic to provide funds to assist in the progression of the project.The Government officials and the Minister will be made aware of any communication that takes place between the First Minister and the British Prime Minister in respect of issues that would impact on discussions they would have in the normal course of events.  During the course of a very extensive meeting with the British Prime Minister on the occasion in question, when both he and the Secretary of State attended a meeting with me and the Minister, I emphasised the need to look at implementing all remaining aspects of these agreements as the context in which progress can be made on all fronts.  As far as a part of the Unionist community is concerned, there is an issue regarding whether public confidence is sufficient to enable this to happen.  Other issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy, were raised.  My view on all these matters is that progress can be made on these issues in that they have their own intrinsic merit with regard to resolution rather than their involving any preconditionality in respect of the other issues, which must be dealt with on their own merits.At the time, both Prime Ministers indicated May 2008 as the date on  which they hoped devolution would take place.  A process was agreed between the First and Deputy First Ministers in respect of steps to be taken that would assist in the completion of the project.  It has taken some time for that to happen but I now believe that in very great measure all those issues have been dealt with.  Now it is political will, judgment and leadership that will enable this to happen.  I still believe it is the view of all parties concerned that it should and can happen.  I only hope we do not find ourselves in the new year without this matter being resolved because it impacts on the stability of the actual institutions.  The imperative must be to find the way forward.  There will be issues that must be addressed and these will be addressed not on the basis of preconditions, but in the wider context of full implementation of the Agreement as envisaged.  In the past, we have seen that is the best way progress can be made.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	78	At the next meeting of the heads of the Scottish, Welsh and British Governments, the Taoiseach and the First Minister of Northern Ireland, might it be possible to have as an item for debate and discussion the possibility of the development of a complete interconnector for joining up the production of electricity?  If this could happen between all Governments involved, I am certain they could apply jointly for grant aid from the European Union for the development of such a grid because it would pave the way for interconnection into Europe.Unless all of us on these islands join up, it will not be possible to develop such a super grid in Europe.  It is essential for the export and importation of electricity into the future and this arrangement is an ideal opportunity for such talks and such development.  A joint approach by all the Governments to set a target for the completion of this interconnector is vitally important not only for Ireland, but for other countries.  I am certain that funding will be available from Europe to enable this complete interconnection to take place and for the development of a European super grid.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I have a very brief comment before the Taoiseach responds.  It is important to note that today EirGrid placed full-page advertisements in the national press indicating it has made the application for the interconnector from County Cavan to the Border, to link up with Northern Ireland Electricity's corresponding development in counties Armagh and Tyrone.  I appeal to the Taoiseach that, if funding is being sought for this interconnector on a joint basis, the critical focus should be to have same placed underground.  Communities the length and breadth of these counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Armagh and Tyrone are of one voice, across all opinions and isms, whether Nationalist, republican or Unionist, that the presence of pylons with the various challenges they present in terms of health concerns and impact on respective communities forms a serious risk.  It will have a deleterious effect on the landscape and daily life conditions of people, who will be placed in fear.  If moneys are to be secured, the real challenge is to place this development underground, in line with the host communities' wishes which must be paramount in any Government's consideration.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	81	It is of paramount importance and consistent with all the international safety standards we already have in this country that the need for the common good should dominate in this matter.  I discussed this with Deputy Enda Kenny during Question Time yesterday.  It is time everybody recognised that when we had very little going for us in this country we had rural electrification.  People co-operated and ensured that power was brought to every part of every region and that people had a chance to try to move from subsistence living to something decent.  We now have a situation where unless a full transmission system is set up in this country, we will put at risk the prospect of economic progress for all those regions.  I, for one——

The suggestion is that everybody's health will be put at risk.  There is no intention on the part of any responsible state body, or otherwise, to be involved in anything like that.  Promoting that idea and creating agitation to negate progress is not helpful.  We must talk to the people candidly, openly and honestly about these issues and must not suggest there is a way the system can be put entirely underground at four times the cost and still leave us with a competitive electricity system and able to create jobs.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	100	We are all aware of the human and real concerns.  Nobody has a monopoly on human or real concerns.  The Deputy certainly does not have one over me.  I am simply making the point, which must be made in this House and elsewhere, that the common good has to take over here.  We deal with issues according to proper safety standards and so on, but the idea that everyone is being put at risk by reason of promoting transmission systems we have used here for years is not an honest way of proceeding, to be frank.To come back to the original question, Deputy Barrett makes a good point regarding the level of integration of our various energy and electricity systems on these islands and in what way we can promote better integration and greater economies of scale while achieving a better prospect of more competitive pricing, etc.  Scotland's First Minister, Mr. Alex Salmond, and his Administration has the lead responsibility in respect of energy matters under the British-Irish Council format.  Arising from the question, I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to write to the First Minister asking him to set out a paper at our next meeting in June, if possible, as to the current level of integration, the proposed plans and the prospects or options they see, as the Administration with the lead responsibility in this area, in terms of co-operating more fully to achieve better outcomes.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The Deputy should give way to Deputy Barrett.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I thank the Taoiseach for the positive reply.  It is important that those who are making statements about the future development of offshore wind and wave projects should not think from a narrow point of view but about the possibilities of massive exports into a European market for the future.  I am sick and tired of people making statements which show they do not have the vision to think into the future.  We have a golden opportunity of being an exporter of energy into Europe if we put the network and the grid in place.  It is vitally important that we work with our colleagues in the other parts of these islands to ensure we have access to a huge European market.  I fully support the development of offshore renewable energy as a means of export and the creation of wealth in this country.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I welcome the Taoiseach's recent involvement in the talks in Northern Ireland.  It is a very delicate time there and, as my party leader said, there is great concern that young people are getting involved in the dissident organisations.  The sooner we can get the policing and justice issues settled, the better.  I urge the Taoiseach to continue working on that.On the issue of the National Asset Management Agency, the Taoiseach might give us some more information on how he intends to involve Northern Ireland in that process because the issue of the Ulster Bank and other institutions like that causes problems.  During his discussions with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister did the issue of the Presbyterian Mutual Society arise?  It is a fairly small banking structure that is causing significant problems for people in that organisation north and south of the Border.I understand the Taoiseach made further comment on his commitment, on behalf of our Government, to the Dublin-Derry road.  That is an extremely important dual carriageway from Derry to Aughnacloy, but I ask the Taoiseach to keep in mind that that road will come to a dead end at Aughnacloy if something is not done between Aughnacloy and Castleshane.  We need to plan for that as well.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I said earlier that a constructive relationship has developed between our Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Administration, Mr. Sammy Wilson, on these NAMA issues which have been discussed at plenary sessions of the North-South Ministerial Council in terms of updating people on the position and the fact that we have now enacted the legislation and are moving to operationalise the agency.  Both sides are happy with the level of information flow that is taking place and concerns are being addressed as people raise them.  Some of them may have legitimacy; others might well be concerns people have and, in terms of explaining how it will operate, those concerns are dispelled in great measure.There was not a specific discussion on the Presbyterian Mutual Society.  Obviously, this is a matter for bilateral contact between respective finance Ministers and officials as to whether anything can be done in that regard.In regard to the A5 and the A8 which are going ahead, progress can be reported.  The contracts are being divided into three separate contracts within the Northern Ireland area for which local contracting firms compete and successfully obtain tenders.  The level of progress made to date has been welcomed.  As the Deputy is aware, we are committed to that project not only as an opportunity to demonstrate North-South co-operation, but because it is very much in our own interest in how we develop the north west that we co-operate with the Northern Ireland Administration to effect a roadway which will greatly improve access to a very beautiful part of the country and one that, with greater co-operation, can be exploited fully to the mutual benefit of all communities in that area.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	113	What about the Monaghan section?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Deputy should ask the Minister.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	115	To return to the policing issue, I listened to the reply the Taoiseach gave to Deputy Ó Caoláin.  I want to underline the urgency about getting the policing and justice issues devolved.  First, it was agreed and therefore that agreement should be implemented.  Second, all of the parties represented on the Executive support the devolution of policing and have expressed that view publicly.  I suppose it is a unique set of circumstances in Northern Ireland in that the main political parties representing a wide cross-section of the communities in Northern Ireland now accept the policing service, the necessity for policing and the public control of that policing.At the same time, there are disturbing signals in Northern Ireland, including a situation I mentioned earlier involving the relationship between the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, a sense of exclusion by the other two parties represented in the Executive and the worrying signs of the emergence of a new generation of dissidents.  It cannot be in anybody's political interest or the interest of any of the parties represented on the Executive to delay the devolution of policing and there is a window now, before politics in Northern Ireland moves into the Westminster election phase, for that devolution to be completed.  It is something the two Governments will have to try to leverage in some way.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is present, to proceed with that because the circumstances are right for it.  The political climate in terms of acceptance of policing across the communities is right also and it would be a tragedy if that opportunity was missed because of obstacles being raised which had not been raised previously.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I agree with all of what the Deputy said.  The important point is to try to ensure that it happens in a timely fashion and in a way which is satisfactory to everyone and on the basis that the process, as envisaged, has been dealt with and completed.  I agree with the Deputy.  Sometimes one tries to resolve problems on the basis of disagreements between people.  It is a question of timing in terms of whether it will happen or when it will happen.The question of public confidence has been brought into the equation, but I believe there is confidence on both sides of the community.  It is for other party leaders to judge that as well but I genuinely believe there is confidence that the devolution of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland will command cross-community support.  I believe the time has arrived for us to try to get that decision implemented.

The Government should pause and stop this madness now.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	133	It is proposed to take No. a5, Appropriation Bill 2009 — Order for Second Stage, Second and Remaining Stages; No. 5 — Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill 2009 — Second and Remaining Stages (resumed); and No. 6 — Forestry (Amendment) Bill 2009 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted on the conclusion of Question Time, which shall be taken for 75 minutes at 9.15 p.m. and in the event of a private notice question being allowed, it shall be taken after 45 minutes; and the order shall not resume thereafter; No. a5 shall be taken today and the Second and Remaining Stages shall be decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in respect of amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; the following arrangements shall apply in respect of No. 5: the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. today; the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in respect of amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; Private Members’ business, which shall be No. 96, motion re social welfare cuts (resumed), shall be taken at 7 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. 5, whichever is the later; and shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	136	No, it is not agreed.  As I indicated previously, the Labour Party will not agree to the manner in which the Government is ordering business because of the undemocratic manner in which it railroaded through the House last week the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill, which will cut blind pensions, as well as the allowances to carers, widows and people with disabilities, and this week intends to railroad through the legislation which is to cut the pay of the lowest paid people in the country.  Apart from the unfairness of the Government's actions, it also is highly unwise from a legislative point of view.  Yesterday, when I asked the Taoiseach about the people to whom the pay cut would apply, it was perfectly clear that he did not know what I was talking about.  Moreover, at the weekend, depending on which Minister was asked, it was not known whether it would apply to the semi-State sector.  One Minister had one answer while another Minister had a different answer.Yesterday, it was evident that the Taoiseach had not even read the Bill, when the consequences of the manner in which public service was defined were pointed out to him.  I note the Government has circulated an amendment in this regard since I raised the issue yesterday.  While this amendment will in turn give rise to anomalies, Members can deal with that in the course of the debate on the Bill.When I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the public servants to whom this would apply, he did not know the answer and certainly gave the impression that it would apply, as the Bill had stated, to people who work in the voluntary sector.  Overnight, the Government has circulated an amendment which would remove that provision.  Does this mean the Government changed its mind overnight as to whom the legislation was to apply or that it simply got the legislation wrong during its drafting?  If it got that part of the legislation wrong during its drafting, what other parts of the legislation have been got wrong?  If the Government intends to guillotine the Bill through the Dáil, to what anomalies and problems will this legislation give rise in its implementation?  On its implementation, I wish to ask one question.  Today is 16 December and the proposed pay cuts are due to take effect on 1 January.  Even were the Bill to be passed and enacted this week, would the pay systems to implement this change have operated by 1 January or will people be obliged to work overtime over Christmas to put it in place?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I strongly object to the ordering of business today, which ultimately is a sham because the Government will state it is providing additional time to address the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill, which provides for the cuts to public service workers' pay.  It will do nothing of the kind.  The imposition of guillotines in the House for each of the Stages is having such an effect that it mirrors what happened last week in respect of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill.  Great numbers of Deputies on all sides will not have an opportunity to participate.  The Bills that are being introduced are extremely important, as the consequences of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill and the Bill pertaining to the cuts in public service pay will be absolutely devastating for entire families.  The Government is driving people into poverty and despair by its current policy pursuits and this is an absolute disgrace.  The entire institution of the Houses of the Oireachtas is being denied the opportunity to properly challenge or to put forward their case once again, however late in the day.  If there is a chance of the Government listening, Members still have a duty and responsibility to provide focused opposition but they are being denied the oxygen of this opportunity to properly debate what is involved by such curtailment motions in respect of time.The Government's unwillingness to ensure the wealthy in Irish society shoulder a greater burden——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I remind Deputy Ó Caoláin that this question pertains to the late sitting.

It amounts to a crucifixion of the poorest in Irish society today and is an absolute disgrace.  Sinn Féin absolutely and wholly opposes both the ordering and passage of this disgraceful legislation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I will not make a speech about this matter.  Fine Gael has been consistent in objecting to the guillotining of Bills going through the House.  I had hoped the Government would relent in respect of No. 96.  It still could secure much goodwill by choosing a different option in respect of Private Members' time.  However, I agree with Deputies Gilmore and Ó Caoláin in respect of guillotining No. a5 and I object to it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Obviously, in respect of the matters raised, it is necessary to proceed with this Bill today in order that it be enacted in the Dáil.  It is part of the €4 billion in savings that must be provided for in the budget.  It gives effect to them and must be implemented to have a full-year effect.  The simplest way in the legislation to define a person for the purposes of this is to have a rule of thumb whereby if one is affected by the pension levy reductions in the rates of pay would also apply.  It is to link——

There could also be issues in terms of pay for people who are not technically State employees but who are working for organisations funded by the State or granted State aid, as a result of the amount of money we are able to provide for such organisations.  It is an internal matter for the employers of the people concerned.

No. a5 is the Appropriation Bill, covering all the Estimates of the various Departments and is significant financial legislation.  The Government wants the House to pass the Bill without debate.  This was the Bill on which the House used to have what was called the adjournment debate before Christmas.

Over the years this has been narrowed down, first to half a day, then a couple of hours and now the Government wants to put the Appropriation Bill, covering the entire finances of the State, through without debate.  In normal circumstances that would not be acceptable, but in the financial circumstances we face and the consequences it has for people and for services it is doubly unacceptable.  The Labour Party does not agree to taking the Bill without debate.

When I first came to the House as a young Deputy many years ago, Major Vivion de Valera used to object to this every year.

In the context of all we have had to face last week and this week in this House, one would need to think very carefully about a Bill entitled "Appropriation".  That is exactly what the Government is doing from the poorest and least well off in our society today.  This proposition like all the rest on the Order Paper should be vehemently opposed by all Members of the Opposition in this House.

We have consistently objected to the guillotining of all Bills through the House, but especially this one.  Deputy Bruton has mentioned on numerous occasions that this Bill has a direct impact on all those in receipt of public pay, but particularly the 55,000 people with an income of less than €30,000.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider again the possibility of having such people excluded on the basis of what Fine Gael has put forward.  When the Minister for Finance was asked about this — I understand he is indisposed today and I hope he makes a speedy and full recovery — he said it would be very difficult in respect of the lower paid segment of the public service.  However, that does not mean it is impossible; it is not impossible.  From that point of view, this Bill should be discussed in a more thorough and complete fashion.  I object to its guillotining under this proposal.

I am grateful for that small concession to the Labour Party.  He said that the Central Bank was to be included in the remit of the Bill, but we have no amendment to that effect.  In addition, there is no clarification of the situation with regard to the proposed reductions for Ministers and Ministers of State.  Is it a reduction of their ministerial or their Deputies' salaries, or a combination of both?  Does the Deputy rate apply to their Deputies' salaries and the other rate to their ministerial salaries?

It is ridiculous that a Seanad vacancy can be filled almost instantly, yet look at the contrast — the public do not have the right to exercise a mandate in Seanad elections.With regard to the Donegal South-West by-election, some six months have passed since the European elections in June.  A vacancy exists in that constituency, so I want to know when the Taoiseach intends to move the writ.  Will he move it this week or does he intend to do so tomorrow?  Or will he commit now that on the resumption of the House after the Christmas recess, he will move the writ in the first sitting week in January?  In that case, the people of Donegal South-West can exercise their democratic choice and pass judgment on the measures that the Taoiseach and his Government have visited on them.

While I appreciate that the Order of Business is running a bit longer than normal this morning, I hope this does not create a precedent.I wish to support Deputy Kenny's point on the EU Committee of the Regions.  Based on the results of the local elections, the Labour Party, like Fine Gael, would be entitled to additional representation on that committee.  I want an assurance from the Taoiseach that my party — and I am sure that Fine Gael is in the same situation — will be consulted about the appointment to the EU Committee of the Regions.  I hope we will not see a skewed appointment announced during the recess.Does the Taoiseach intend to attend the House tomorrow to tell us the date on which the Dáil will be back in January or will he have somebody else do so on his behalf?I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the consequences of yesterday's Supreme Court decision, its implications and the court's criticism that legislation has not been brought forward to deal with assisted reproduction and related matters.  I saw a statement from the Minister for Health and Children that she intends to bring proposed legislation to the Government.  There is nothing on the legislative list, however, concerning such legislation.  Nor did I see anything about it in the programme for Government.  When will that legislation be brought forward?  Will it be based on the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, which was published almost five years ago?

With regard to the writ for a by-election, the Government has not made any decision on its timing.As I said yesterday, we will have to examine the impact of yesterday's Supreme Court decision.  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction brought forward about 40 recommendations.  This legal case will now have to be factored in to whatever work is ongoing in the Department of Health and Children.  This is such a complex ethical issue, I would ask that the widest possible consensus be obtained in the House and the relevant committees in order to make progress on it.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	203	There has been a wide-ranging discussion on the Bill and I appreciate the time and thought put into the contributions on all sides of the House.  There is disagreement on the approach that has been adopted by the Government in this case.  It is a blow to hard-working public servants.  They may feel singled out but this is not the case.  Reducing pay rates for public servants is not done lightly by the Government.  On the contrary, all avenues were explored before this approach was adopted.The Government was criticised for entering discussions with the public service unions on how to deliver savings to the payroll for 2010 and beyond.  I disagree with the criticism fundamentally.  Any responsible employer seeks agreement with their staff on the way in which to make savings from pay.  It is unfortunate that the proposals of the trade unions did not meet the Government's aims.  They did not save enough money.  Despite the figures that have been bandied about since, the proposals that were put to the officials would have saved, at most, €750 million.  Any savings proposed were not permanent and only for 2010.The Government was rightly concerned that compulsorily curtailing the working days of public servants, even within constraints imposed by management, would have an impact on services to the public at a time when demand has never been higher because of our increasing population and the effects of the economic downturn.  We had to cut the public service pay bill because it amounts to a third of Government spending.  Quite simply, we cannot afford to continue to pay public servants at current rates.  This is not a Government plan to reduce pay rates in the country generally, as some commentators have suggested.  The cost of the public service pay bill has increased greatly over recent years.In his contribution yesterday, the Minister for Finance compared some salary figures over the years.  The public service pay and pensions bill has doubled over the past decade, both because of increased numbers and higher salaries.  Simply put, it is no longer sustainable given the state of the country's finances.While budget 2010 may have involved the biggest adjustment, it is well known that further savings from expenditure will need to be made over the course of the next few budgets.  Significant savings from the public service pay bill could be achieved through changed work practices and by eliminating outdated customs and procedures.  The public service unions accepted that fact and argued strongly during the course of discussions with officials that significant pay savings could arise from modernisation.  Public servants will benefit from modernisation.  The number of public servants will continue to fall because of the effect of the moratorium on recruitment and of retirement in the normal course of events.  The remaining public servants will need to adapt the ways in which they deliver services if service levels are to be maintained or improved, which is the basic demand of all citizens from their public service.The public service unions are concerned about redundancies in the public service.  It is, therefore, in their interest, and the interest of management, that a public servant whose current post is no longer required can be redeployed to an area of greater need.I invite the public service unions to consider the position calmly.  We appreciate they may be aggrieved over the failure of the talks process.  This is not a time for industrial action.  Ultimately, as with any industrial dispute, we will have to talk to each other about how we can ensure the employer's financial good health.  The Government believes dialogue should start sooner rather than later.A number of issues have been raised about the scope of the Bill.  The difficulty when drafting a Bill providing for a reduction in the remuneration of public servants is that, of necessity, it must have a wide application given the size of the public service pay bill.  By taking the widest possible definition, the Government is able to spread the burden of the €1 billion reduction in the overall pay bill and take a smaller amount from each of the 350,000 workers in the public service.  Therefore, a wide definition of "public service body" was used in the Bill.  However, this created potential for some individuals to be defined as public servants although they would not regard themselves as such, nor would their employers regard them as such.  This is because the State helps to pay for the employment of thousands of people by a myriad of bodies and through a wide variety of funding mechanisms to do valuable work in the community.The simplest way in legislation to define public service employees and distinguish between them and private sector employees whose employment is helped by State funding is to use the approach taken when applying the pension-related deduction to link their employment to their current or potential access to a public service pension scheme.  In order to pin this issue down, the Minister for Finance published amendments last night to the draft Bill that will clearly define who is affected by the pay reduction by linking it to access to a public service pension scheme.  The rule of thumb will be that if one is affected by the pension levy, the reduction to the rates of pay will also apply.  The amendments will be discussed later today.A number of questions have been raised in the debate on Anglo Irish Bank and the NTMA not being covered by the Bill.  The general intention is that the reductions in pay will apply to the groups covered by the pension levy.  Neither Anglo Irish Bank nor NTMA is subject to the levy.  The former does not come within the definition of a public service body covered by the Bill as it does not have a public service pension scheme.  For the reasons explained in the Minister's Second Stage speech, the provision is not intended to cover commercial bodies.NTMA is not a commercial body but the pay of its staff is determined in the same way as applies to staff of commercial bodies without direct ministerial control.  It is appropriate, therefore, that it be dealt with in the same way as commercial bodies not covered by the Bill.Mention was made of the absorption of voluntary salary deductions of 10% by Ministers, Ministers of State, Secretaries General and some others for 2009.  The Minister for Finance asked the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to examine the pay of the groups covered by its terms of reference, including Ministers and Secretaries General, by reference to comparable positions in the private sector and those in other countries, and by taking account of the current state of the economy.  This exercise was designed to consider a more permanent position in regard to the pay of these groups.The review body recommended permanent reductions in the pay of those it examined, ranging from 8% to 15%, and 20% in the case of the Taoiseach.  It is important to note the review body recommended specifically that the reductions it proposed should replace the voluntary reductions already made and that these should then cease.  Ministers are now taking a permanent reduction of 15% and the Taoiseach is taking a reduction in pay of 20%.  As mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his Second Stage speech, Ministers of State will take a permanent reduction of 10% although, on foot of the review body's report, the reduction for other groups at similar salary levels will be 8%.  The Secretaries General of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance have volunteered to take a reduction of 20% although a cut of 15% was recommended by the review body.Some speakers have attempted to suggest these reductions do not involve a significant change by referring to the voluntary reductions.  This ignores the major difference between a temporary reduction and an ongoing permanent reduction in pay.  It is ironic that those who showed leadership by taking a voluntary reduction in pay are now having that used against them in an attempt to mitigate the significantly greater reduction now applying to them.It was asked whether the Minister would exempt persons earning less than €30,000.  If a reduction did not apply to the first €30,000 of salary, there would be a very substantial decrease in the savings to be achieved in the order of €450 million.  This reflects the fact that approximately two thirds of public servants have salaries of €60,000 or less and that the average salary is approximately €50,000.  The reality is that, in order to achieve the required savings, reductions must be applied at these levels.  There would be difficulties and anomalies if any attempt were made to apply an exemption to persons with salaries under €30,000.  It would cause anomalies for those with salaries a little in excess of €30,000, who could be worse off than those with a salary under €30,000, or for persons on incremental scales, whose increments could bring their salaries over €30,000 and worsen their position.The question of possible pay cuts in the commercial State-sponsored bodies was also raised.  The pay reductions of public servants have a very specific purpose, that is, to reduce the burden on the public purse of the public service pay bill by approximately €1 billion.  Pay cuts in the commercial State-sponsored bodies such as Bord Gáis and ESB will not have that affect because the pay of those bodies is funded generally through their commercial efforts.  Due to their nature they have a large degree of autonomy in regard to pay.  With the exception of chief executives, the Minister for Finance does not control the pay of the staff of these bodies.  They have not been covered by the public service element of pay rounds in the past and have taken an independent approach to controlling their pay bills, as happened in RTE where voluntary reductions were agreed by the staff and in the ESB which has had several voluntary redundancy schemes.While these companies must be allowed to act commercially, and in accordance with the normal industrial relations process, the Government believes pay restraint in these companies fulfils the long-term national interest, namely, ensuring competitive pricing for energy and other goods.  It is the market and the regulators, however, that will impose that discipline on those bodies.The exception would be the pay rates of the chief executive officers of these bodies.  The Government is concerned at the top pay rate levels across the economy.  While this Bill addresses the pay of top public service posts, the Government also proposes to have the arrangements governing the pay of chief executive officers of commercial State-sponsored bodies reviewed.I wish to address why the lowest paid public servants are not excluded from this Bill.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, after line 35, to insert the following:""enactment has the same meaning as in the Interpretation Act 2005;".This is a technical amendment which seeks to bring clarity to the Bill in terms of to whom it is supposed to apply.  The word "enactment" is used in paragraph (g) of the definition of a public service body but is not defined in the Bill or in Schedule 1 of the Interpretation Act 2005.  The amendment is, therefore, required because the definition of “enactment” in the Interpretation Act applies only for the purposes of that Act.There is a serious problem running through this Bill in terms of to whom exactly it applies.  When we first received the legislation, as drawn up as required by the Minister, it applied to anybody who is a civil or public servant not working in a commercial semi-State body.  The Bill also cast the net much wider to apply to anybody who worked in an institution or any type of body paid for out of public funds.  I raised with the Minister yesterday the question of whether, for example, under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 this included home help providers and people working in partnerships, family resource centres and similar bodies funded out of public funds.  It seems to me we are no clearer regarding to whom exactly this Bill applies.  In terms of the amendments submitted by the Government and others we have not yet seen, it would appear that this applies to a public service body where there is provision or potential for a pension scheme.  It does not matter whether the individual is entitled to a pension by virtue of his or her contract of employment, for example, part-time workers or cleaners on very low wages who may work a limited number of hours and, therefore, do not have an entitlement according to the terms of their contract.It disappoints me that no information has been forthcoming from the Department of Finance to whom exactly this "enactment" will apply.  This is fundamental because the Bill includes powers to take 5% from persons on the lowest level of wages.  As I pointed out yesterday, the lowest level is those earning under €30,000, but a part-time cleaner earning €15,000 or €18,000 does not pay any tax because the person's personal credits and allowances will not place him or her in the tax net.  Such persons will pay a full 5% gross, whereas the reduction in the pay of somebody earning €30,000 or €35,000 who pays tax will be allowable for tax purposes and such a person will end up paying a smaller amount than the person on the lowest level of public sector pay.It was obvious in the debate yesterday that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Taoiseach had properly read their own legislation.  Clearly, they handed it over to the civil servants.  There has been no opportunity to discuss the full remit of this Bill.  From previous experience in the Dáil, when legislation is rushed to the degree that this legislation is being rushed without proper examination and scrutiny by the relevant Minister, the Taoiseach and the Ministers at the Cabinet table, we end up with a mess.  That, I predict, is what will happen with this Bill.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	209	To illustrate further the point Deputy Burton made in respect of her amendment No. 1, it came to my attention yesterday that within the teaching profession, which is a group of 57,000 of the 300,000 workers affected by this Bill, a small enough group work on a temporary basis for perhaps five, ten or 12 hours a week.  They are not in the same category as permanent pensionable teachers in the primary or post-primary sector.  They work X number of hours or classes per week.My understanding, which the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, might be able to confirm and which certainly is the view of some of the teaching unions, is that those working in a temporary or even a temporary whole-time capacity are subject to this across-the-board 5% cut.  Such teachers gain nothing by way of pension and have no standing within their profession because they work purely on a temporary basis, and yet the full rigours of this 5% cut affects their pay.  Will the Minister of State confirm that because it goes exactly to the point Deputy Burton makes in respect of those employed on a part-time basis within the public service?When it comes to secondary teachers, it is on average 27 years before persons are made permanent.  It is less so in the primary sector.  One is dealing with a cohort of post-primary teachers, who do not have any standing within their school because they work on a temporary hourly basis, who will be also subject to this 5% cut.  In the context of Deputy Burton's interpretation amendment,  will the Minister of State confirm that for the information of the House?

The word "enactment" is used twice in paragraph (g) of the definition of “public service body”, but both with the words “by or under”.  It is also used in the definition of “relevant provision”, but in the context of “pursuant to”.  These are normal-type reference without defining the word enactment.  The Interpretation Act 2005 had to define it for the purpose of that Act itself but it is not of general application, as has been already noted.  In this context, there is no need to define the word for the purposes of this Bill.  In view of the considerations and advice of counsel in the matter, I do not propose to accept the amendment.On amendments not being received, I am not sure to what amendments Deputy Burton referred.  The amendments from the Government were circulated by mid-afternoon and some of Deputy Burton's amendments were received only mid-morning today.  I do not know what other amendments she has in mind.  There are no other amendments coming from the Government.

It states:In page 12, line 28, to delete paragraph 22.Home helps are included where they have a public service pension scheme, as some of them do.  Part-time workers' pay is set having regard to full-time workers' salary scales and the rate is then appropriately applied to part-time workers.  If a worker works 50% of the equivalent full-time worker rate, his or her pay will be reduced accordingly.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	214	That is an important piece of information.  The view of the unions is now the Minister of State's view as well, that those working in a temporary capacity within the schools, often on five or six hours a week, will find their pay slashed by 5%.  The Minister of State has just confirmed that for the information of the House.Is it fair and reasonable that a group of people, who have no standing, who have no pension entitlement, who have no status or standing within the school where theirs is a week-by-week, month-by-month contract, and who want to become full-time eventually and have all of the resulting advantages, must face an across-the-board cut in their temporary pay at the same rate of other workers?  Can the Minister of State justify that to a range of persons, particularly those within the education sector who are five or ten years out of college and who still cannot find a full-time permanent job within the sector and are unlikely to do so given the Government's curtailment in the number of new teaching posts in the next three years?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	215	My party's legal advice is that this applies to any body or institution where provision of a pension is possible, irrespective of whether such pension is provided.  As Deputy Brian Hayes stated, that applies in the educational sector.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, acknowledged, that can apply, under the HSE and the Health Acts, to the wide range of persons such as home helps.I put it to the Minister of State that many home helps who earn only between €10,000 and €20,000 a year, and in some cases less, bear the full brunt of a gross 5% cut because they do not pay tax, whereas for those on the higher incomes there is a net deduction because of their personal tax allowances, etc., and it is those at the very bottom of the scale who will take the highest cut.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The point I was making before we broke for the sos was the full extent or remit of the legislation is very unclear from the Bill.  I made the point in respect of those on a very low wage in a contract with a body which has a pension scheme.  Such people do not necessarily have a public service pension but it appears likely they will be caught under the remit of the Bill.I refer to one specific group of people who will be caught by the Bill and to the considerable consequences for the country.  There are people in all our universities, institutes of technology and other research institutions who are contract researchers in departments at the cutting edge of the so-called Irish knowledge economy, most of whom do not have tenure.  They work on contract and as a result, normally do not have pensions as such because they do not hold a permanent tenured position in the institution.  Many such people are Irish and have been wooed back home.  They are in a very competitive situation in respect of fourth level research.Many such people have been brought back to Ireland in the past four or five years and, where they could afford to do so, bought houses at the very peak of the market.  These are people between their late 20s and middle 30s and are shipping water.  They are very bright and include PhD and post-doctorate researchers.  They are very skilled and work at the cutting edge of the Irish knowledge economy.  As a result of the way in which the Government has drawn up the Bill, it does not distinguish between such people and a person in the public service with a permanent, pensionable position who, when he or she ultimately retires from public service, will have the benefit of that public service pension.In statements made on RTE this morning the Minister declared his intention to exclude such categories of people from the remit of the legislation.  However, I put it to the Minister of State, that while this amendment does not deal directly with this issue, there is time for officials in the Department of Finance to check the validity of the legal points made by the Labour Party such that the Bill can be amended before it is too late.The same argument applies to those working in home help.  The Minister has confirmed that those working in the home help area will also be subject to the legislation.  Such people may be part of an institution which has the benefit of pension arrangements but they may not get the pension or may be only small beneficiaries of any such arrangements.It is very difficult to have to contrast this treatment with what is happening to those at the very top of the commercial semi-State sector.  Yesterday, I gave the example of the chief executive of Coillte, who is earning in excess of €450,000.  Today, the newspapers are full of examples of other heads of commercial semi-State organisations in the same happy position.  They are not affected by this legislation.  The Minister has promised he will hold discussions with such people because their salaries fall within his remit.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, suggested this would be addressed quickly.However, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, have stated in no uncertain terms that they were waging a war against public servants, including people working in home help, fourth level researchers in our universities who were attracted home and people in schools on indeterminate contracts, part-time contracts and low wages.  Guess what?  They are not waging war with the people at the very top of the commercial semi-State organisations.There is a further set of people about whom there is no discussion whatsoever, namely, those in Anglo Irish Bank.  It is now a fully State-owned bank.  According to the Minister's earlier reply, it is not even considered as a semi-State organisation.  It is a nationalised bank.  Guess what?  The top people in this bank earn vast salaries and the Minister might be able to provide some indication in this regard.  Yesterday, no less a person than Professor Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, stated that Anglo Irish Bank is not a systemic bank, thus upholding the view of the Labour Party since the night the bank guarantee was introduced.  This bank is the cause of many of our difficulties and troubles but it is not systemic.  There are people on salaries of many multiples of €100,000 working in a failed bank that has brought grief and ruin to each of the four corners of Ireland.  Those affected include nurses, gardaí and everyone else who is suffering because of the budget.  These people are suffering on behalf of Anglo Irish Bank.Lo and behold, we have a Bill that proposes to cut the wages of public sector people and others paid by the public sector or who may have part-time contracts with an agency paid from the Exchequer.  They will all pay this levy, but Anglo Irish Bank will not commit a red cent to it.  People may refer to fairness and public servants are realistic.  They realise we must try to get the economy back into shape.  However, when the perpetrators of the greatest crime against the Irish economy for several generations along with their masters in Fianna Fáil are exempted from this but those who work as cleaners pay a levy or have their pay reduced by 5%, where is the fairness in that?  It is completely inappropriate.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I will try not to labour this point but we need some clarity on the matter.  In a response on Second Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, remarked that the rule of thumb which would apply to this Bill is that those affected would be those who pay the pension levy.  Earlier, I cited a groups of teachers who do not pay the pension levy.  Typically, these are young people, recently out of college who cannot find permanent, temporary, whole time or any work in the education sector to which a contract applies.  These are referred to broadly as substitute teachers and are the life and soul of the education sector.  If a given teacher is not in today, a substitute teacher is found by tomorrow.  Ostensibly, they are young people trying to get some experience in the sector while also trying to make some money one or two days per week.  They do not pay a pension levy.  They have no terms of contract and work as substitute teachers.Will the Minister indicate in respect of this category of worker within the education sector whether he is suggesting to the House that the hourly rate of pay for post-primary teachers will be reduced by 5% and the daily rate of pay for primary teachers will be deduced by 5%?  These are very simple questions which require a simple reply.  Is the position I have put to Dáil Éireann correct?  If so, then the Government is flouting the fundamental principle as espoused by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, in response to this debate on Second Stage earlier today.  He led the House to believe the only group affected is those paying the pension levy.  Is what I have suggested actually the case?  Will the meagre income of a group of substitute teachers in primary and post-primary education be slashed?  That is only one group of workers.  An entire group of people in the semi-State sector, at top, bottom and middle levels, will not have any reduction.  Will the Minister of State give a definitive answer to that question?

People on community employment schemes might end up facing these cuts under the current structure of this Bill.  It is bad enough as it is — scandalous — but that would be altogether outrageous.  People on FÁS programmes might be caught in this net too and if that is the intention, the Government really has a lot to answer for.I agree entirely with Deputy Hayes's comments regarding temporary and part-time teachers.  There are other categories, but this is an excellent example of what is going on.  I hope the Government will deal with this because it is a very important issue with people on very low incomes being hammered.  If the Minister of State does not deal with it, will he at least make an effort to try to ensure that those Members of this House who will still hold teaching posts after one full term resign their positions and allow temporary teachers to gain full-time employment and access to pension entitlements, etc?

As the Minister stated, the cut proposed for persons on the very lowest pay is progressive and its effect on the pay of the lowest paid is reduced.  Substitute teachers are on a special rate of pay that reflects the nature of the work they do.  The legislation will affect their rates of pay, but the broad intention is to limit it to those who pay the pension levy.I do not accept Deputy Hayes's point that a 5% cut slashes people's pay.  It is not of that order and the fall in the cost of living has been approximated.  These are painful decisions and nobody wants to make them, but they must be made so that those who are paid, whether on social welfare or on the public pay bill, can continue to be paid and the cheques made out to them honoured.  I am a little puzzled.  I am sure the Deputy will hasten to correct me if I am wrong.  The Fine Gael budget proposals included reducing the threshold of the health levy from €26,000 to €13, 500, which, in the rhetoric of this debate, is called impacting on the poorest of the poor.  I wonder how much consistency there is.I must declare an interest with regard to Deputy Burton's point about contract researchers.  I have a daughter in precisely the position she described.  She came home within the past four years and bought a house, not quite at the peak of the market but not a million miles past it.  She is on a substantial level of pay.  Given the money that was put into scientific research, although most contract researchers do not have tenure, they are paid reasonably well while researching.  I do not in the least deny there are problems and I will hasten to assure my daughter that Deputy Burton is defending her cause.We must be careful on the subject of fairness.  Is it fair to treat part-time workers differently and more favourably than full-time workers simply because of their absolute levels of pay?  One could be in danger of creating an entire new set of inequities if one was not careful.A number of Deputies raised the issue of those whose income is low because they work only a certain number of hours.  It is not possible to exempt any group from the impact of these pay reductions and in many cases we are only reversing the last couple of pay rises because we have imposed a low rate of reduction on those with salaries below €30,000.  The reductions are progressive and the point was made that if people at the bottom are exempted, the progression is made very sharp.  Obviously, I do not accept rhetoric such as "war on public servants".  I hasten to add it is not really relevant to this amendment but the debate has ranged extraordinarily widely.

I quoted some figures in my contribution yesterday.  If the Deputies care to pick up the pay rates for any job in the public service they care to name, whether low, medium or high paid — I accept these are skewed towards the medium and high paid and include all Members of this House among the high paid variety — they will see, at minimum, substantial increases and, in many cases, a doubling of income in ten years.  Unfortunately, because of circumstances, those increases have not proved sustainable and to keep the ship afloat we must make these adjustments.  Nobody likes doing this but it must be done.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I remind the Minister of State there is a fundamental difference between what he proposes today and the public service pension levy.  In that case at least provision was made to differentiate between people on very low wages of €18,000 and under and others.  This measure does not distinguish between anybody on any wage.  As I stated in my comments on the Bill, if a person earns €10,000 a year as a part-time cleaner he or she will have to pay the 5%, which from that person will be a gross full 5%.  There are a few men involved but most people in that position in the public services are women.  People meet them in the offices early in the morning.  However, for people such as the Minister of State, other Members of the House and other people in higher-paid occupations in the public services, the reduction in wages will be effective and will carry through with regard to their tax liabilities because as their wages go down, their total tax bill will go down.  The impact of these measures are particularly onerous and harsh on the lowest paid people in part-time work.  It is foolish to continue, as this Government has done in the budget, creating and widening poverty traps.The Minister of State referred in somewhat technicolour terms to the golden era of public services.

There are huge numbers of people tolling away on extremely low wages in Hong Kong; Dubai is another example.  There are then people at the upper echelons, including ex-patriots, who live very well.  Hong Kong and other societies like that may do very well in international financial terms but many of the populations in those countries do not, and the countries which have better outcomes are countries like the Scandinavian countries where there is a decent level of public services, health and education and where the difference between wealth and people on lower levels of income is not as extreme as it is in many developing countries.  That is a reality and there is proof of that.The intention behind this Bill, and from the Minister of State's talk about the golden era of public service——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Minister of State appears to have conceded a point that is different from that made by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, stated clearly that people who were not in the pension levy net would not be caught.  We now find that temporary teachers who are not eligible for a pension are being brought into this net.  Only a few minutes ago the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, gave us the impression that they would be exempted.  The reason they would be exempted is easy to understand.  They are not qualifying for anything.  They are not getting the benefits of job security, pension or any of the benefits that have been the basis for the Minister deciding that this was a justifiable claim.  Does the Minister of State wish to consult with Deputy Burton?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I do not want to hold up the debate but it is important that we address the interpretation provisions and understand the justification.The Minister of State appears to be somewhat stung that people would suggest that those earning €21,000 should be asked to contribute.  He is saying this is a necessity but he will recognise that when Fine Gael put forward proposals we deliberately excluded people at that level.  We had a conscious view that public servants earning below a certain level of income have been asked to contribute already and they do face difficulties.  It is worth saying that a person on €21,000, which is the equivalent salary of someone on the cleaning staff here in the House, is paying 20% income tax, the 2% Lenihan levy, so to speak, 4% PRSI, the 4% health levy, the 6% pension levy introduced in February and now they are to contribute again with a levy of 5% on their earnings.  It would be folly for the Minister to suggest that the people on low earnings who are in this category do not make a contribution, that they have broad shoulders and are able to bear the adjustment in the economy.The Minister of State is right.  We face grave challenges but the question being raised is not whether we face grave challenges but the way that burden is shared.  Should people on very modest income by the standard of the Minister of State or any of the Deputies debating this Bill be asked to pay a contribution that, on their after tax income, is greater in many cases than people on far higher income?  It does not seem fair when one considers that the Government had all the wisdom of the Minister of State and his senior colleagues sitting around the table and deciding how they would share this burden of adjustment in a way that would be fair.  I cannot fathom how they came up with the notion that people on the lowest income should make the biggest proportionate sacrifice.  It is difficult for the people affected who are trying to keep families fed and mortgages paid.  It is very difficult for them to understand and there is a great deal of fury among the people who are caught.The Minister needs to justify before the dock of his colleagues the reason he has made this selection when there were other ways he could have dealt with this issue, and other parties have offered ways of dealing with that.  The Minister may quibble with what we are doing — there is always room to quibble — but the principle that he asked the highest proportion of contribution from those on lowest pay is one he would not ask if he was on this side of the House.  He would rise up to his full height and use all the immense eloquence at his disposal to excoriate a Government that was doing it.

The Minister should top up those figures because it means he is asking someone on €21,000 to pay a 43% marginal tax rate.  Riddle me that and I will give you a pipe, as my mother used to say.  How did the Minister come up with that?  How does all the wisdom that is assembled on that side of the House come up with the notion that the highest paid people in the country, as far as their tax is concerned, will be paying virtually the same marginal tax rate as those people at the very lowest level?  How did they come up with that wheeze?

What has changed?  If I allow the Government some latitude, it clearly saw this would have a penal impact on a lower-paid group within the public sector. However, this budget will apply a pay cut to the first euro earned by every person in the public sector, regardless of his or her income.  People who earn €21,000 or slightly more are worried because they do not qualify for a medical card.  They qualify for nothing from the State.  Suddenly, such people have lost between 10% and 12% of their income on foot of the last two measures introduced by the Government.  Nothing has been increased in respect of limits or qualifications for benefits such as medical cards or GP-only cards.  What has changed?  Although a budget should satisfy the twin requirements of being equitable and fair, this budget fails both criteria.  Why the change?

I refer Members to, for example, examples 7 to 9 from the supporting documentation provided with the budget, which shows clearly that the percentage change in net income since the budget of 2008 and not just this budget ranges from 5% to 31% at the top level, with quite a sharp increase once one gets above €35,000.  Consequently, it is highly progressive.I again wish to raise the point that was taken up by none of the Members opposite, namely, whether it is fair or equitable to treat part-time workers more favourably simply because they have a lower absolute level of income.  In certain cases, one can be a part-time worker in more than one employment.  Is it fair to treat them more favourably than full-time workers?  I believe this will create an entire range of new——

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	282	That is because the Minister of State has two pensions.

The American system may have been regarded up to now as being more dynamic, while the European model may have been regarded as being more socially caring.  I refer to what is called the social market economy.The point has been made, perhaps more outside the Houses then inside, that this is a plot against the minimum wage.  Absolutely no changes are being announced or, in so far as I am aware, are under consideration in respect of the minimum wage.  One of the merits of the minimum wage is that it gives people an incentive to work whereas if one permits the minimum wage to be driven down or if no minimum wage exists, there is little incentive to take up low-paid employment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I was looking at the table to which the Minister of State drew Members' attention.  I refer to example 5 in table D.  It shows that the impact on people with different levels of income is approximately -7%, -6%, -5% and -1% for those with incomes of €15,000, €20,000, €25,000, and €250,000, respectively.  The Minister of State is completely wrong.  This budget asks for seven times the contribution from people with the lowest income than from those who have the highest income in proportionate terms.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The answer is we did.  Is the Minister of State aware of the part-time workers' directive, under which the State was taken to court in respect of part-time teachers?  On 10 November last, the Department of Education and Science was obliged to pay back a sum of €11 million to those 600 part-time teachers who had received the wrong rate of pay for the past ten years.  This is the example to which the Minister of State referred and he must read up on his brief from the Department of Education and Science.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The Minister of State simply does not get the basic point, which is that someone who earns approximately €10,000 is not liable to taxation and, as a consequence, he or she is paying a full gross net 5%.  Therefore, the burden of this adjustment and reduction in wages absolutely is borne more heavily by them than by the other categories, who are higher earners and who will have tax allowances deducted and who will, therefore, have a net, as well as a gross, deduction.I do not know what school the Minister of State has been attending but the budget has an economic effect which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has admitted is highly deflationary.  If the Minister of State believes that cutting the wages of the lowest-paid people, such as part-time cleaners, constitutes a major boost to the economy, I assure him it is not.  As for part-time contract workers, the Minister of State must have seen the recent coverage in the newspapers of young people getting ready once again to leave this country, together with their qualifications.  The stop-gap for the last two years for graduates and others coming out——

I do not know in what economy he lives and do not know whether he has heard of the concept of economic stimulus that appears to be in fashion with everyone else in the world.  However, the budget presented by the Minister for Finance is highly deflationary, as is cutting the income of the lowest-paid people in society.  As the Minister of State may remember, people on very low incomes spend most of their money into the local economy and, therefore, are valuable to local shops.

In page 4, line 13, before "does" to insert the following:", subject to the right of any of the following persons to notify the Minister that the person's remuneration should be treated as if the person were a public servant within the meaning of this Act,".It is a relief to move to the very highest paid in the land.  They are the kind of people with which the Minister of State is familiar and he will be much happier discussing them.  They are our distinguished judges — the members of the Judiciary — and so on.  Nobody could say this group of people are not very highly paid.  As the McCarthy report pointed out, not only are they highly paid but, because of their intense brain power, they accumulate a pension at a speed which does not apply anywhere else in Ireland.They are well-paid and well-apportioned.  I understand they have what is, as I understand the term, "tip staff" working for them as personal assistants in and out of court who will be paying the full 5%.  In courts all around the country presiding judges will be sitting in front of courtrooms with people such as gardaí coming in to give evidence and public servants who record and facilitate the proceedings of courts.  All of those who are not on the judicial benches will be taking the cuts in full.  Not all cleaning is contracted out.  Fianna Fáil may have thought the situation was different, but cleaners are still directly employed by some parts of the public service.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The part-time cleaners in the courts, the gardaí, the tip staff and clerical staff in the courts will all be taking the hit.  The judges will have a choice.  They will receive what may be termed a "sweetie-pie" letter from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, whenever he recovers, suggesting that they might think about making a contribution to the State's coffers.We are all aware of the provision in the Constitution stating judges should never be put under pressure by politicians who are or are not in power regarding influencing their judgments.  They are meant to be independent and should act independently.  We have a Judiciary which has always acted without fear or favour towards any politician, political party or group of politicians, which is as it should be.The protection afforded to the Judiciary in the Constitution against their pay being arbitrarily reduced is to stop an over-weaning Executive punishing a judge because he or she made a judgment which goes against its wishes, following which it may seek to restrain him or her.  We are not discussing such a situation, which is what the Constitution provides for.  We are examining a situation whereby judges — at least 50% of whom share this general view — no less than those who work with them in the public service are willing to take their share of the burden of pain and adjustment which has to be taken to get us out of the economic mess created by Fianna Fáil and its banker and developer friends.  That appears to be the position of a majority of our judges.It is wrong that there is no provision in the Bill to explicitly encourage judges, as the Labour Party amendment seeks to do and is therefore perfectly constitutional, to consider their position and the appropriate response from people who are very well paid, looked after and appointed.  Judges are a core part of the democratic functioning of our State.  Nonetheless, they ought to share in the burden of adjustment given that they are well paid and looked after in terms of their pay and pensions.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, and the Taoiseach have suggested that the Government has received opinions from the Attorney General that it is not possible to touch the pay of judges.  The Labour Party amendment seeks to acknowledge that, nevertheless I have outlined the reasons why I believe judges' pay can be addressed.  This is belling the cat.  The Minister of State is very willing to be tough on contract workers and low-paid part-time workers and has said how good such a tough approach is.  However, there is a softly-softly approach to the Judiciary.There is a simple remedy open to the Government, that is, to legislate for this measure and allow any judge who wishes to do so to take a legal challenge.  They, more than almost every other person Irish society, are well-equipped to launch a legal challenge to overturn a pay cut for judges, as there is for everybody else in the public service.  If that happens, we will then have a definitive view on the constitutional position regarding the proper protection of judges from an overbearing Government seeking to interfere in judicial functions.It is possible to have judges take the same general terms and conditions which apply to other workers, such as income tax and capital tax.  They are not treated as special individuals rather, they are treated the same as the general body of citizens.  The Government has run away from this issue.  If it is put into law judges can, if they so wish, contest it.  If such a contest leads to a ruling in favour of the Judiciary, we will need to amend the Constitution.  However, that is not necessary.  It was cowardice on the part of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, that he refused to allow an opt-in measure for judges in this Bill that would allow them to demonstrate what is true regarding a majority of them, namely, that they are prepared to share the same burden imposed by this Bill on their fellow citizens employed in the public service.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	338	This is an important issue in that people look up to or ought to look up to the judges as being fair and independent in the way they deal with every case.  It is regrettable that judges now find themselves in a category where rules that are being applied to everyone else are not being applied to them.  I do not believe that was ever the intention of those who wrote our Constitution, an issue that has been dealt with by others, including by a very eminent lawyer in a recent contribution to The Irish Times.  The intention was that no Government would seek to victimise judges in a selective way.  I do not believe either the pension levy or the present deduction would victimise judges.  The Judiciary stands a much greater risk by being seen to stand apart from the rest of the community than by being a part of it.  It would be regrettable for judges to come into public disrepute because of their standing apart from rules that apply generally.  Judges have been dealt with particularly generously in respect of pension eligibility.  They establish pension eligibility after a very short service and also have very generous buy-back and other opportunities to build up their pensions.  That is an acknowledgement that they are taking on a very important duty and in some cases are taking pay reductions from their practices elsewhere.We must avoid judges ending up being seen to be above the laws applied to anyone else.  Unhappily the judges are being seen to be above this law and the one that preceded it.  On behalf of Fine Gael, Deputy Shatter has drafted an amendment to the Constitution that would remove the pretext the Government has had to use to exempt judges from these pieces of legislation.  The Minister should accept our amendment and put the issue to the courts so that judges, if they wish, could test it to ascertain the interpretation of the existing restriction and whether it is, as many people feel, that judges cannot be singled out for unfair treatment.  The courts would then rule whether what would be done by our amendment is fair or, on the contrary, the courts could support the Government's view.  One way or the other the Minister should either accept our amendment and let this go to the courts to be tested or alternatively accept Deputy Shatter's Private Members' legislation and let it be decided by the people.  We should not drift along with judges being treated as if they are outside the law that applies to every other citizen.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I support the proposed amendments on this matter.  While I do not wish to repeat what has been said, I do not believe the late President, Éamon de Valera, when he was drawing up the Constitution ever intended that it be interpreted in this way.  However, I suppose he never anticipated that his own party would ultimately bring about such a situation in the economy resulting in the need for us to cut public servants' pay in a manner such as this.  One way or the other, we should proceed, let a challenge be taken if people want to do so and let the courts decide.  It is a fanciful interpretation of the Constitution to interpret that cutting judges' pay, as is happening for every other public servant, is not permitted in accordance with the Constitution.  I would include the President in this.  However, I acknowledge that the President and some judges on a voluntary basis have taken a pay cut.  However, all of us public servants, from the President to the low paid in the public service, should be included.Why should a military judge also be excluded?  Where does the Constitution specify that a military judge should be excluded?  It brings resentment and does not do any good to the office held by these individuals.  I am sure that the individuals in question do not want this and would prefer to be treated like everybody else.  As has been pointed out, in a courtroom the gardaí standing at the door or giving evidence will have their pay cut and the person sitting on the bench will get no cut.  The clerk sitting in front of the judge is taking a pay cut.  It is ridiculous and unsustainable.  I suggest that everybody be included and as Deputy Bruton has said if somebody wants to take a challenge, so be it.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	340	A very important principle is involved here.  In addressing that principle those of us in this House should be careful about how we approach it.  An essential cornerstone of our Constitution is that the independence of the Judiciary is preserved, that the Government does not put the Judiciary under pressure on any particular issue and that the Judiciary is not perceived as giving into Government pressure.  A second important aspect is that the Judiciary should not be seen to give in to pressure from Members of this House to do something that is unlawful.Another very important principle is that the public respect for the Judiciary is maintained.  There is a difficulty in this area, which derives from Article 35.5 of the Constitution which states in a very straightforward way: "The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office."  That provision is not unique to this jurisdiction and reflects constitutional and legislative provisions in place in democracies across the world.  The reason is to ensure that a government or Parliament that disapproves of judgments or decisions delivered by members of the Judiciary does not seek to take revenge on the Judiciary by reducing salaries and that it does not seek to reward judges who deliver decisions with which the Government agrees or with which the majority in Parliament agrees.In addressing this issue we should not deal with it on the basis of any criticism of the members of the Judiciary themselves.  However, what is utterly wrong is the manner in which the Government has approached this issue and the pension levy issue, which is related to it.  We were equally told that the pension levy could not apply to the Judiciary because of this provision in the Constitution.  Arguably, imposition of the pension levy on members of the Judiciary would not have been a reduction in their remuneration.  It would have been a levy applicable to them commensurate with the levy applied across the public sector to require them to make a payment towards the pension fund from which they will benefit in future years.  There is an argument to be made that the pension levy could have applied to the Judiciary, but because of the manner in which the courts have interpreted this provision in years gone by, I can understand why the Government would have been reluctant to have applied the pension levy to the Judiciary for fear that it would become embroiled in difficult and unpredictable litigation in the courts.Whatever about the possibility of applying the pension levy, Members of this House should not be under any illusion that it is open under the existing constitutional provision to apply what is a straightforward reduction in remuneration to members of the Judiciary.  If applied to the Judiciary, this legislation would do exactly what the Constitution precludes this House and the Government from doing.  We should be under no illusion about that.It is also very dangerous and should not occur that we read in the newspapers either by leaks through the Department of Finance or by express statements by the Revenue Commissioners as to how many members of the Judiciary have contributed to the pension levy.  I believe the levy should apply to members of the Judiciary, but there is a problem with possible constitutional difficulty.  It is wrong because this suggests it is possible to use public pressure to force members of the Judiciary to make decisions to apply to themselves legislation that this House has not applied to them.  That is only a short way from suggesting that this House or the Government can use public pressure to require the Judiciary to deliver decisions in our courts, and the perception on the part of the general public would be that the Judiciary is no longer independent but has become the plaything of Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas, or the political system.  That is a dangerous slippery slope which we should not be going down.Among many outside the House, quite understandably, it is perceived to be grossly unfair that the public sector wage reduction does not apply to members of the Judiciary.  I believe it is unfair that they are excluded from it and it was equally appropriate they be included within the pension levy.  It is important to maintain public respect for the Judiciary.  At a time of economic emergency they should be seen to make a similar contribution towards solving the problems of the State to those made by everyone across the public sector.  As the law stands at present, that cannot happen.  There is a serious danger that not only will the Judiciary be damaged by being excluded from this, but it will also be brought into disrepute within the public mind.  A good point was made by a previous speaker that almost everyone in the courtroom, including members of the Garda Síochána and court staff, will be affected by the legislation, while the judge is immune.There is only one way in which this issue can be properly addressed.  I put this to the Minister of State.  Does he believe it would be fair — leaving aside the constitutional difficulties — if the public sector provisions detailed here, which apply, as has been eloquently explained, to the very low paid, applied equally to the highest paid, within which designation falls the Judiciary, from District Court to Supreme Court?  The pay of a District Court judge is at least 50% of the pay of a Deputy in this House.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Yes; I am sorry.  It is 50% more than the pay of a legislator in this House, no matter how many years he or she has been here.  If the Government believes it is fair that this be extended to the Judiciary, we should bring to an end calls on its members to voluntarily contribute to pension levies or hand back a portion of their salaries.  What we should do is to put the necessary constitutional amendment to the people in a referendum.Such an amendment was published by me, on behalf of Fine Gael, in the Twenty-ninth Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2009, which seeks to ensure the independence of the Judiciary is protected.  Its general provision is that the remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office.  However, it provides an exception "save where it is necessary to address a serious threat to the State's economy, there is a compelling need to stabilise the State's finances and as a consequence it is necessary to effect a reduction in public service remuneration; in such circumstances any reduction in the remuneration of all public servants or in the remuneration of a class of public servants may be applied to effect a comparable reduction in the remuneration of all members of the judiciary".  The effect of that would be that in times of economic emergency, if there was a general reduction of pay across the public service, it could apply to the Judiciary.  This means any such reduction would not be seen to be targeting the Judiciary in any way.In addition, if there was a reduction in the pay of a comparable class of public servants — such as everyone in receipt of a salary of more than €100,000 per year — this would also apply to the Judiciary.  However, it would not allow for the targeting by the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Judiciary for a pay reduction because it disapproved of some judgment or decision delivered in the courts.  It is crucial we preserve the independence of our Judiciary and that we as politicians — and the Government — do not try to create a public perception that the Judiciary will respond to public or political pressure with regard to the manner in which its members conduct themselves.  We must now create the constitutional space to implement fairness in this area and facilitate the Judiciary in making the contribution necessary to tackle the economic emergency, as is being done by everyone across the public sector, including Members of this House.I ask the Minister, in the context of this debate, to indicate whether the Government will support this Bill.  Will it agree to put it to a referendum in the new year?  A total of €3 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the Department of Health and Children for a constitutional referendum on children's rights next year.  The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children will report by the end of January and is on the verge of resolving certain issues.  I believe it will ultimately present this House with the opportunity of a constitutional amendment Bill.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	344	In the context of this issue, a referendum could be held on the same day at minimal additional expense to update our constitutional provisions to deal with the current economic difficulties.  We need a proper constitutional mechanism to address this issue.  We should not play games with it, nor should the Government.  It is the Government's responsibility to address this issue and with the Bill that is now being published, it has the opportunity to support it by providing time for it to be debated in the new year and facilitating the necessary referendum.  I ask the Minister to confirm that the Government will do this.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	345	It is my misfortune to have to comment on this Bill after Deputy Shatter, who has a detailed legal understanding of the constitutional issues involved.  As a lay person, I find it is one of the most infuriating aspects of the endeavours to bring order to our public finances that a section of our society, whose members are well paid even by international standards, are exempt from the provisions of both the previous pension levy and this Bill.  We are led to believe this is on the basis of advice received from the Attorney General, but that is a mask of convenience for the Government.  While I appreciate that the advice will not be published, I feel it should be.  It is advice that has been criticised and debated, with alternative views promulgated, in both the public arena and academia.There are differing opinions on the matter.  What is important is the purpose of the constitutional provision in question.  It was obviously to ensure the independence of the Judiciary.  However, in respect of both the pension levy and the pay reductions provided for in this Bill, it is not as though either the Executive or the Houses of the Oireachtas is seeking to single out the Judiciary for specific treatment to settle a score or whatever the case may be.  It is rather the case that the exclusion of the Judiciary serves to bring it into disrepute.  Its inclusion in the provision would put its members on the same basis as every other citizen in the country.  While I accept that precedent will prevail and the Attorney General's advice will not be published, there is an alternative strongly held legal opinion that as long as the intention is not to single out the Judiciary or seek retribution through such measures for decisions made in court of which the Government did not approve, its inclusion within the scope of the Bill is permissible.One of the ways this can be resolved is by passing the Bill published by Deputy Shatter.  However, another equally meritorious way would be to pass the provisions of this amendment into law, which would leave it open to any member of the Judiciary or other citizen to take a court action and obtain a definitive interpretation of the constitutional provisions.  I should be surprised, when we are asking everybody — the cleaner, the tipstaff, senior civil servants, chief executives — and when it is abundantly clear there is no intention of singling out the Judiciary, that it would be well nigh impossible for courts to find this was the intention of the legislation or of the Dáil.I support the amendment.  I believe it should be included as a speedier way to bring resolution to this issue.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	346	As Deputy Shatter has said, there are a number of very important principles we need to be fully cognisant of in terms of this debate.  One is the separation of powers.  This goes back to the foundation of the State and is something fundamental that I believe people would be loathe to tamper with.  We all understand that.Another important principle is the fact that we have been well-served by the judges, again going back to the foundation of the State, from the lowest to the highest courts in the land.  They have international reputation and standing, which is justified for the excellence of their judgments, the professionalism in which they go about their work and for their impartiality.  That balance is something we all accept and respect.We need to be aware of another constitutional provision as Members of Dáil Éireann and the Seanad Éireann.  Under the Constitution we cannot enact laws or make resolutions which we knowingly believe to be unconstitutional.  The dilemma, as Deputy Shatter indicated as regards Article 35, is that it would seem to be a cut and dried case that we cannot reduce judges' pay.  The political issue revolves around the question as to why we have allowed this issue to fester for 12 months.  Two Deputies on the Government side at that time called for the referendum that Deputy Shatter has now proposed and published.  I recall Deputy Niall Collins, the Member for Limerick West, publicly saying the Government should have included the members of the Judiciary in last year's pension levy, as proposed in the context of the 2009 budget.  Twelve months later and no progress has been made.Whatever about the dilemma as regards cutting the pay of members of the Judiciary, I believe a very strong case can be made for having the pension levy imposed on them.  Take the case of a District Court judge on €150,000, or thereabouts, as gross pay, who loses about one third in tax, leaving take-home pay at around €100,000 a year, or about €9,000 a month net.  I spoke to a young teacher yesterday with a mortgage of €1,200 a month, on a gross income of €37,000.  This time last year that teacher was taking home €2,300 a month.  Under the Government's proposal that has now gone down to €1,800, a drop of €500 a month in a 12-month period, yet District Court judges taking home €9,000 a month are seeing no cut whatsoever.Did the Government not foresee this problem, knowing that it would have to seek another cut from the public sector?  It has allowed this issue to fester for 12 months with no political solution to the dilemma being presented as a result of Article 35.  I want to hear, not alone from the Minister of State, on this, but also from the backbenchers who publicly took to the airwaves 12 months ago to deride the Judiciary for not participating in this.  We have seen many fine examples of members of the Bench who have voluntarily decided to hand back parts of their salary.  Also, we have seen such an initiative from former President Mary Robinson while the incumbent, President Mary McAleese, has shown great leadership, by example, in terms of her pay and conditions.  However, there is a political issue here which the Government has failed to address over 12 months, because it must have known it was coming down the tracks again, given the public furore regarding the pension levy last year.  I do not believe it is fair that a young teacher loses €500 a month, thanks to Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, while a District Court judge keeps everything.  That is not fair.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I support both of these amendments.  I cannot understand why the Government has failed to deal with the Judiciary payment in the same way as it has with other public sector workers.  I am sure any fair-minded judge would like to see the Government acting decisively instead of messing with this issue.  I do not believe this should necessarily be a referendum issue.  Probably, it would be a belt-and-braces matter if there were to be a referendum at some stage to deal with it conclusively, but we know it is not necessary in this case.As previous speakers have said, any judge who disagrees should be taken to court.  Why military judges are included I cannot say.  I am not too sure what they do in their daily lives, but I am sure it is not something that is likely to be tampered with by the Government.  I do not believe it is anything other than basic human rights and fair play across the board they look at.  They are unlikely to influence any Government decisions as regards what they do.A significant number of amendments have still to be addressed and disgracefully, there is little time left.  I hope we can get to all of them before 7 o'clock this evening.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13524	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	350	——-I believe we need to start slaughtering a few sacred cows in this great Republic of ours.  When somebody in the public service has to incur a cut of €1, 500 in his or her salary and a member of the Judiciary is exempt by virtue of a constitutional arrangement, that speaks volumes about the nature of the society in the Republic.  If Ireland, as a republic, is to treat and cherish everybody equally, and if we subscribe to the French principles of liberté, égalité and fraternité of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware, then we should have no qualms in these troubling times about reducing the salaries of the members of the Judiciary. I believe we are unduly deferential to people who hold such positions.  While we are respectful of the role they have and of the constitutional arrangements as regards the separation of powers, I do not believe they should be exempted from such cuts by virtue of a legal advice that has been given to the Government.  We rely too much on such legal advice matters and hold them in too great a stock, because sometimes they supersede what is fair and equitable in terms of how the common man or woman might perceive such questions.  I gladly support the amendment that has been tabled on the basis of it being equitable and right for this country at this time.

It is important to remind ourselves that this is an insult to public sector workers, particularly the low paid, those that are being hammered.  In line with the spirt of the amendment I believe that an exemption for judges should never be an option.I also want to put on the record my strong support for the public service and public sector workers.  I should like to defend those teachers, nurses, fire fighters, bin workers and other public sector employees who have been attacked and vilified in recent weeks.  This has caused great hurt and anger to many of them and it has deliberately divided public and private sector workers.  This is a disgrace and it is not on.  How many of those politicians and right-wing commentators, including Ministers and backbenchers, would last 20 minutes in an accident and emergency unit at midnight on a Saturday?  How many of them could work as a teacher in a disadvantaged school where 15% of the pupils come to school hungry and without basic home support?  What about a public servant on €30,000 per year with child care costs of €300 per week?  Such commentators should come into the real world because those are the real issues people are dealing with.As regards amendment No. 2, I strongly believe that judges are public servants and that is what they should be.  We must constantly watch the constitutional issues, but it is important to realise that these judges are paid by the taxpayers.  Many of them are extremely wealthy and well off.  How dare anybody come in and try to hammer a lowly-paid public sector worker, yet do nothing about wealthier people in society.I strongly support amendment No. 2.  On the broader issue of the public service, however, I still think it is a disgrace they way they have been treated over the past nine or ten days, particularly by right-wing media commentators and some politicians in this House.

It is unhelpful and also unfair because this issue has not been caused in any way by judges.  They are in a most difficult position, but it is one that was thrust upon them by the Government.  The Minister of State and his colleagues must deal with this situation.  I find it extraordinary that the Government has done very little to redress the imbalance.  The preservation of judges' independence is essential and I hope that is a given from all sides of the House.  A direct consequence of that independence is the matter of public respect and esteem, which must not be damaged or diluted in any way.  We are running the risk of bringing judges into disrepute because of something for which they are not responsible.  Article 35.5 of the Constitution is quite clear in stating: "The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office".  That is the wording of our Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann.  It is not sufficient to say, however, that just because of that constitutional impediment we should leave matters as they are, because there is a question of fairness and justice here.It is unfair that there should be what, in effect, is a most generous exemption for certain public officials, namely judges.  It is simply unfair and I do not believe that any argument the Minister of State puts forward can include an element of unfairness.  This is especially so when there is a well-founded perception, or rather a fact, that judges are well paid — perhaps rightly so, given the nature of their work and the need to preserve and underwrite their independent position.  Having said that, I think judges should play their part in what is a financial crisis brought about by the Minister and his policies.  Why was this problem not foreseen earlier, however?  Why was it not dealt with in a better way than by allowing a situation to develop where we have a weekly media circus in the form of a league table of how many District, Circuit, High or Supreme Court judges have, or have not, made a voluntary contribution?  That is no way to allow the situation to develop because, ultimately, it brings the law into disrepute.  If public respect and esteem for the Judiciary is damaged, it will undermine the whole basis of the administration of justice in this country.  It will be damaged by having such a weekly league table.  It is akin to TDs' expenses whereby journalists jockey for position in dressing up a story to make the news.  It is fundamentally unfair and wrong.  As well as bringing this House into disrepute, it will also affect the position of judges on the Bench as people who independently preside over the justice system.The Minister has placed judges in a very difficult position and it is not sufficient for him to quote some legal advice as the reason behind this generous exemption.  I put it to the Minister to find a solution.  I believe the basis of such a solution is in the amendments.  If the matter is to be dealt with comprehensively, then Deputy Shatter's amendment must be followed.  There are and will be opportunities to deal with the situation early next year.  It is unfair and unsustainable, however, to say that a group of people who are generously paid by public funds through the Exchequer should, in effect, have an exemption.  Many of them may not wish to have such an exemption, yet they have been placed in a difficult position because of the Government.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this legislation.  Having listened to colleagues on all sides of the House, we need to keep one issue in mind.  There is a grave danger that what happened over the past 12 months has divided society in a way that has never been done in this country before.  The reason is that the Government now seems determined to govern by public acclamation.  One cannot govern by public acclamation, however.  It has been tried as far back as Roman times and it failed then.  Every time it has been tried since, including during the French revolution, is also failed.  It was done on the basis of people being angry because they were hurt as a result of some atrocity committed by those who governed.  I do not want to be too historical in my comments, but it is a fact that every time the people got angry during the French revolution, more people were executed.  Eventually, when their thirst was sufficiently sated, they decided they were no longer angry.The great anger here has been created by the Government's failure to govern or do anything proper over the past ten years.  A year ago, somebody from the Government said: "Well, I'm very sorry folks. Things have gone a bit wrong and have come unstuck, so we should take some measures".  It called first for Dáil Deputies to make a sacrifice because it should start at the top.  In all my time in this House I never knew that I was at the top.  I am glad to know now, at last, that I was not at the top at any stage.  There are several people in the queue who are well ahead of the ordinary Dáil Deputy or Senator.I resent the fact that the Government has used this division in society to promote its own ideas and objectives over the past 12 months.  It could not care less about the consequences.  I have to agree with my colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, that we are not, and should not be, in a position to comment in this House on the way judges think or act.  That is not our job.  In fact, there is a provision in the Constitution which clearly separates the functions of the Houses of the Oireachtas from those of the Judiciary, for very good reasons.  Occasionally we trespass, but when we do so we err and get a bloody nose.  I would warn against going into that area too quickly or too often.The Government's mantra is that everybody must pay, it must be spread right across the board, and that these tough decisions must be made.  It never says anything about the right decisions being made though, it refers to hard decisions.  This is based on the Adlai Stevenson theory that there is no gain without pain.  As we know, it will be all pain and no gain for the people.Let us consider what has happened.  For the second time in 12 months, we have been treated to the same mantra and have been told we must make sacrifices.  For the second time in the same year we have been told there is more pain to come and things will get worse before they get better.  In the same breath we have been told that the revival is around the corner.  Where have we heard that before and what in God's name are we playing at?  The Government has been codding the people and is continuing to do so.  It is codding them now in the House, just before Christmas.  In the past week the Government has decided to go around with the begging bowl and take from the poor.  It intends to take from the most vulnerable in society and to hammer and beat them.  If they were not angry already, they will be angry now.  However, certain groups of people will not be included in this punishment.  Where did the Government go wrong?  Why did it get its projections wrong in the first place?  What has it been talking about for the past 12 months?With regard to the amendments before us, the people are looking for encouragement, leadership and fairness.  They want fair play and are questioning what is happening every day.  I am sure the people are asking the questions of Members on the Government side of the House as well as asking them of us.  I am sure e-mails are pouring in to those on the Government side.  The people are saying, as Deputy Flanagan mentioned, that they did not cause the problem, rob the banks or create the bubble in the property economy.  The people who did this — or those who supervised it — are sitting on the Government side of the House.  They have successfully avoided accepting responsibility or any blame for what has happened, but have now proceeded to call upon the multitudes to ask what they should do next — governance by public acclamation.  This is an appalling situation.  The divisions being created in society now are being created deliberately.  They will be long-lasting divisions and we will live with the consequences for many years to come.This kind of thing has happened before and I and others have raised this in the House previously.  In the past, across Europe and the globe division has been created in society, leading to hatred, begrudgery and envy.  This is a very dangerous route to take.  I hope those on the Government side know what they are doing.  Unfortunately, I am afraid they do not.  Based on what we have heard over the past 12 months, I dread what the next 12 months will bring.  If we go by the record of the past, we will have cuts for all, particularly for those most easily targeted.  Those people who have been most easily targeted in the past 12 months will be equally the easiest targets in the next 12 months.  However, it seems those who have managed to avoid being hit by the cuts or who are seen to be beyond reach, whether in banks, property companies, elsewhere or in Government, will not have to pay the same price as they are seen as an elite.  Elitism is something this country cannot afford at any time, least of all now.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	356	Like Deputy Flanagan, I regret we have reached such a pitch that we must discuss the Judiciary in this manner in this House.  I suppose it is a pointer to where the Government, with Fianna Fáil as the dominant partner, has brought us that we are back here for the second time this year cutting the pay of public servants.  This is happening against a background where the Minister for Finance has, on a few occasions here, spoken about the incomprehension on the Continent that he managed to cut the pay of public servants by almost 8% last April and we did not end up with people protesting on the streets.  Madame Lagarde, apparently, is aghast at the effectiveness of the Minister for Finance here.  The Minister, apparently not satisfied with that, has now come back for a second bite.  One is left with the impression that it is inconvenient of us even to detain the Government for a short number of hours to discuss the issue.I understand that approximately half of the members of the Judiciary have, on a voluntary basis, contributed the same or similar concession.  We should record our appreciation of the manner in which separation of the Legislature and the Judiciary has operated in this country and of the manner of discharge of their functions by members of the Judiciary.  However, we are thrust into a debate where one cannot avoid focusing on the issue of fairness.  Just before I came into the House today, I opened a letter I received from a teacher who stated his income was down by approximately €6,000 because of the decisions of the Government in the budget, by €6,500 as a result of the pension levy, €1,800 due to the increase in the health levy, by €2,100 from the income levy and by €1,000 due to the increase in PRSI, but as a class D PRSI contributor this additional tax was of no personal benefit to him.  It is almost beyond belief that we are here in this House of Parliament discussing for a second time such cuts in the pay of the people who work for the State and that last week we finished a Bill through which the Government was proud to advance a measure that, effectively, kicked away the stick from the blind man and from people with disabilities.  The Government is back for more this week and we are expected to bend the knee in its favour.  People on €30,000 or less are expected to accept an increased pay cut of 5% again.We must consider the Judiciary in this context.  Members of the Judiciary are well paid.  If one does a comparison of the relative progression over recent years of members at the base grades of the public and Civil Service with those at the very top, the gap has widened significantly.  In those circumstances, it is fair and reasonable to expect that highly paid public servants, in whatever office, would make the contribution.  One wonders why we need discuss this at all.  I have great respect for the Office of the Attorney General and for the current holder of the office, but there is a contrary view.  The contrary view has been enunciated by a number of legal experts.  The contrary view has also been expressed by former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Donal Barrington, to the effect that there is no constitutional impediment in the way of this deduction being applied.If one looked at the preface to the Bill, one would think we were either facing a war situation or a famine, there are so many "whereases" in the preface of the Bill about the national emergency.  The Bill is entitled "Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest".  That is a hell of a way to list pay cuts, but there we are.  If this is a financial emergency affecting the State — and I concede it is — we are being led to the edge of ruin by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and his colleagues.  If it is a financial emergency, it is fair and reasonable to expect all highly paid members of the public service to be asked to pay their fair share.Many people in the media are feeling hurt themselves at present.  Many media corporations have been cutting back and are imposing cuts on their staffs, who are not overly well paid.  Some obviously believe it sells papers to chase around for the next victim of pay cuts.  Semi-state companies are the ones in the media eye this week.  I suppose it will be the bishops next week in so far as it can be said we are funding them.  It should be worth devoting a front page to the matter to see if they will accept a reduction.  I do not really have much time for this approach, yet it must be remembered we are dealing with a Bill that proposes to reduce the pay, for a second time, of people on very modest incomes.  If people on superior incomes are seen not to accept their fair share of the burden, there is no fairness in this measure.I hope that in the very limited time available, we will be allowed to discuss why the lowest paid will be subject to a 5% cut.  I believed there would be a floor or threshold, just as there was a threshold, albeit miserable, in the case of the income levy.  People on the bottom are e-mailing Deputies on both sides of the House about how difficult it will be for them to survive in 2010.  In this context, it is fair for us to expect higher-paid public servants to make a fair and proportionate contribution.

Over the years, a factor has been the money it is possible to earn at the bar.  In the context of tribunals and in other contexts, this is a matter for discussion, albeit at another time.I agree with Deputy Charles Flanagan that a great many judges would prefer if there was no exemption for them.  A very real issue of fairness arises.  It is difficult to disagree with most of the points that have been made.  The review body indicated that if it had been open to it to make a recommendation, it would have recommended a reduction.  It was not open to it constitutionally to make such a recommendation.The Government stated it will not increase judges' pay during its lifetime.  I accept this only addresses a small part of the point.

The emoluments and allowances of the President cannot be diminished during her or his term of office.  The Constitution states: "The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office."  It is not qualified by any reference to circumstances.It has been underlined forcibly, particularly by Deputies Charles Flanagan and Alan Shatter, that the independence of the Judiciary and the rule of law are key principles in our democracy.  That is the reason for the clear constitutional provision.  The Government intends to abide by the Constitution.  In its opinion, the amendment proposed by Fine Gael is not constitutional and cannot be incorporated into the Bill.On Second Stage yesterday, it was acknowledged that a referendum would be needed to modify judges' pay.  It cannot be modified through this Bill.  I have been reminded of Deputy Shatter's Bill, which is before the House but which has not yet been debated.  I cannot pre-empt the Government's deliberation on it but can state it is logical from what I have been saying that a constitutional amendment would be required if, in an economic or financial emergency, judges' pay were to be reduced and to be commensurate with that of all other public servants.The amendment proposed by Deputy Burton would allow the President and members of the Judiciary to volunteer for the pay reductions to apply to them.  This is unnecessary as there are existing voluntary waiver mechanisms in place.  The President and members of the Judiciary have already waived portions of their salary in respect of the pension levy.  The Minister for Finance announced that a mechanism will be provided in the forthcoming finance Bill to facilitate such waivers.  However, it will not be singling out the Judiciary.  For the aforesaid reasons, neither amendment is acceptable.

A judge of the High Court has an annual salary of €243,000 according to the remuneration of higher public servants review published by the Minister for Finance last Friday.  That is the third highest rate of pay for those public service officeholders examined in the study.  It should be borne in mind that other public servants at that level have already taken pay cuts averaging 9%.  It is now proposed to implement a further cut of up to 15% to this group's pay.  The two highest Secretaries General, in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, have volunteered cuts of 20%.Some weeks ago the Minister for Finance said we are in a war situation.  On last Sunday's "The Week in Politics" he said he did not want to open a war on another front with the public service.  The Minister has on two occasions been minded to describe the country's situation as an economic war.  In war, everyone must share the burden.  We have heard at length from the Minister how low-paid workers such as cleaners will have to put their shoulders to the wheel in the war effort to restore the economy.  What about the judges?It is regrettable judges have to be singled out in this debate.  However, it has to be done.  There is a remedy to this problem in the legislation which is to make provision for the Judiciary.  Distinguished members of the Judiciary have set forward their understanding of the constitutional position regarding their pay.  It was framed by de Valera to prevent, correctly, an angry government taking out its revenge on a judge who may make an adverse judgment against it.  In today's world of 24-hour media coverage, the provision ensures a judge's decision will not be affected by media pressure.  These protections are important for maintaining the independence of the Judiciary.  In Italy, for example, there has been an ongoing campaign against reforming anti-corruption judges by certain elements of political life, including high officeholders.No one wants to see such developments in Ireland.  However, there are judges, probably more than 50% of them, willing to shoulder the burden along with their fellow citizens.  They are being put in an invidious position of being asked to do nothing while the poorest people in the public service have taken relatively large hits between the pension levy and the further imposition provided for in this legislation.The Labour Party amendment has been framed, as the Minister of State rather grudgingly acknowledged, to be precisely constitutional to overcome these protections.  While I believe it could have gone much further, it has been restrained.The Minister for Finance told us the banks were going to be restrained in the last Finance Act when claiming back tax losses.  So far this year, the Government has paid over €1.6 billion in tax refunds, one reason the tax take is down.  I discussed this with the Minister for Finance at the time of the emergency budget.  The Minister did nothing about it because once again he sought not to disturb a very powerful and positioned group in society — the banks, the financiers and the oligarchs.I believe most judges are anxious to be full contributors in dealing with our economic difficulties.  Whether they are, it is open to the Government to address the issue.  The Labour Party is offering a way of positively including judges in this legislation without giving rise to any constitutional issues, as the Minister has acknowledged.  It would be better for Irish democracy if the Minister were to accept this amendment as it would make a positive provision for judges offering to take part in the deduction.It is possible to go further.  If a disaffected judge believes the levy and the reduction should not apply to him the same way it applies to a nurse and a teacher, he has the remedy of going to the courts.  If he wins in the courts, we will obviously need a constitutional referendum.  Everything I read, however, indicates we will not need one.  There is a strong judicial opinion in this respect, including the previous case in which the courts found judges were liable for income tax because it applies to citizens.Why is the Minister pussyfooting around this amendment?  This is like the emergency budget — tough on poor people but not on those in the upper echelons.  There is a series of exemptions from this legislation ranging from Anglo Irish Bank to the bosses of the semi-State companies, all on over €400,000 a year.  The people in the top echelons in a war, to use the Minister's words, are the generals who give leadership.  Following on from that, judges are akin to generals.  Why are they exempt from this legislation?Every public servant who serves a judge in court, be they gardaí, clerical officers or tipstaves, will be taking this pay hit on their modest incomes.  In common with Deputy Rabbitte, I have received sad letters and e-mails from nurses married to gardaí with two or three children explaining what the hit will mean to their incomes.  As they are younger they are taking a further large hit with negative equity in their homes.  By the end of next year, when mortgage interest rates go up, they tell me they will be sunk.  However, a particular category will be exempted from this hit.While I do not want to be singling out the judges, the Taoiseach has said we are all in this together.  Fianna Fáil's position shows we are not.  Certain categories, such as the fat cat bankers who have ruined this country and the bosses of the top semi-State companies, are specifically excluded by Fianna Fáil from this legislation.

I want the Minister of State to clarify — I did not mean to be disorderly when he was speaking — if, as he said, it is unconstitutional in his eyes to impose a reduction in salary on judges, how then he can justify the Minister saying in his speech that he has decided that there will be no increases in judges' pay during the lifetime of this Government and that future Governments may choose, as in the past, to continue this source of action.  Surely, that is discriminatory——

I will give the layman's position on this.  The Constitution appears to protect the privileged.  While justice is about fairness, unfortunately, it does not seem to win out in this case.  The Minister of State said the whole purpose of protecting judges against a pay cut is to protect them against any undue hostility or reward from the Government of the day.  However, the Government has singled them out here.  All Members of the House have received correspondence in regard to the two Bills recently introduced in this House in respect of pay cuts, namely, the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2009 and the Bill now before us.  I vouch that next week they will be contacting us about what is happening in regard to the banks and the privileged, namely, judges.  It will be difficult for judges to sit in their courts and sentence people in respect of minor or major indiscretions and so on, as in the case of the clerical hierarchy of this country to say, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone".  Respect for the Judiciary will be lost.  It is unfortunate that this issue has come before this House for discussion in the manner it has.  Taking this to its logical conclusion, it appears to me that the Minister for Finance could come into this House in the future and say he or she is raising the rate of tax by 2% on the marginal rate and will be excluding the Judiciary in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that point.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I call Deputy Bruton on the basis that he has tabled amendment No. 3.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I want to return to what has been said by other contributors.  While I heard the Minister of State's contribution today I recall that in an earlier contribution he praised himself and the Government for the action they are taking in the context of this legislation.  This has the level of credibility of a pyromaniac who sets fire to a building and then seeks praise for calling the fire brigade.  In so far as praise is being sought, as has been said by other speakers, this issue we are now discussing arose at the time of the introduction of the pension levy and was not an unexpected issue in the context of the legislation before the House.I find it extraordinary to hear the Minister of State representing the Government in this House now say he cannot pre-empt what the Government might decide on whether there should be a constitutional referendum on this issue.  The Government has been aware of this problem.  If it did not realise it before imposing the public sector pension levy, it has certainly been aware of it since then.  On the basis of the Attorney General's advice, whether disputed or not, the Government excluded application of the pension levy to members of the Judiciary.  I listened with interest to what other Deputies said and to the references to the former and distinguished member of the High Court and Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Barrington, who has spoken on this issue.  I remind Members of the House that my understanding is that his speaking on this issue applies to the pension levy and not to what is a direct reduction in a judge's remuneration about which the Constitution is enormously clear.  I do not believe that when Eamon de Valera presented the 1937 Constitution to the Parliament of this State and ultimately the people he anticipated that a future Government, in particular a future Fianna Fáil-led Government, would essentially completely and utterly destroy the Irish economy and create that which this legislation recognises is a financial emergency.We are dealing with a Fianna Fáil created financial emergency and a constitutional provision drawn up by someone whom I presume in those days had some ideals in terms of what might be achieved by Governments in this State and did not anticipate the complete, total, utter and gross incompetence of the Taoiseach when Minister for Finance and his continuing incompetence.  An indication of the level of continuing incompetence is that this constitutional issue has not been addressed by Government.  I accept when the Minister of State says — I know colleagues on this side of the House are sceptical about this — that for good or ill there is a constitutional difficulty in applying this public sector wage decrease to the Judiciary.  On occasion, we, as politicians, come under so much heat it is fun to shoot verbally at other people.  While it is on occasion fun to shoot verbally at the Judiciary in this House, it does not add to public respect for the Judiciary or our court system.The truth is a problem exists, of which the Government has been aware for some time.  My colleagues, Deputies Brian Hayes and Charles Flanagan, asked why the Government has ignored this problem up to now.  I appreciate, as the Minister of State said, that a constitutional problem arose and that the Government may be thinking about this.  The Bill I introduced on behalf of the Fine Gael Party was first distributed just under four weeks ago.  The Government has had just under four weeks to consider its content.  Within that four week period it has had its internal budget debates, its external budget leaks, its announcement of the budget and this legislation, which was under preparation.  No one acknowledged there was a problem and asked what was to be done in respect of the judicial exemption in times of a financial emergency.  I agree with all speakers on this side of the House who said that non-application of this remuneration reduction to members of the Judiciary is utterly and grossly unfair but there exists a constitutional barrier to its application.  As legislators, we have a duty to uphold the public esteem of the Judiciary and to protect its independence.  As suggested by Members on this side of the House voluntary contributions to a pension levy are a charge imposed by way of contributing to the creation of one's pension fund which arguably may not be cut under Article 35.5.  I, too, have argued that possibility although I understand the Government's difficulty with it.  I understand from where Mr. Justice Barrington is coming on that issue.  It may well be that there are significant numbers among the Judiciary who take the view that there was no constitutional barrier to having the levy imposed on them and that is why they are voluntarily contributing to it, but there may be a constitutional barrier to members of the Judiciary, under pressure from Government, this House and the general public, agreeing to hand back a portion of their salary because that, in effect, is bringing about a reduction in judicial remuneration by public pressure.  This is an issue which, in fairness to the general public and to the Judiciary, should be addressed.Deputy Mansergh is here as Minister of State representing the Government.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	390	He is not here on a solo-run representing himself.  He is here based on his remit to implement Government policy collectively made at Cabinet within the constitutional framework of the State.  There is no reason a decision could not have been made during the course of the Cabinet's deliberations announced on Budget Day that a referendum will be held to extend, in times of emergency, the possibility of a public sector wage reduction to members of the Judiciary in the interests of fairness, nor is there any reason that announcement could not have been made in the House.  The lame contribution of the Minister for Finance in saying he will set up a procedure to facilitate judges to contribute voluntarily to a pension levy and then remaining silent on the issue is yet another indication of the incapacity of the Government to join up the dots, to examine the issues comprehensively, to apply principles of fairness and do what is right.I again ask the Minister to give the House a pledge that the Government will agree to hold a referendum on this issue in conjunction with the children's rights referendum and that the wording that will be put to the people will be that proposed in the Fine Gael Bill or a similar wording to ensure two matters, namely, that the independence of the Judiciary continues to be protected but, in times of economic emergency, the same wage, salary or remuneration reductions can be applied to them as are applied across the public service to those in receipt of an income of similar or identical nature to the Judiciary.  It is a straightforward question.If the Minister of State is telling us that the Cabinet has not even considered this issue almost a month after the Bill was published and got a first reading in this House, it is an indicator of how out of touch and incompetent is the Government.  If the Minister of State has no riding instructions on this issue, perhaps he would send out for them.  Perhaps a message could be sent to the Taoiseach asking that he clarify Government policy on this issue based on the debate that has taken place in this House to ensure that fairness applies, the issue is addressed and at the same time we protect judicial independence and the public esteem the Judiciary deserves in the context of the difficult and, on occasions, dangerous job we ask them to do.

I refer to Article 35.5 of the Constitution, which states, "The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office." We all want an independent Judiciary.  Deputy Shatter, who is an authority in this area, asked the Minister of State to give a commitment that the Government will hold a referendum on the matter in conjunction with the constitutional referendum on children's rights.  It would be normal practice that such a referendum would take place on the same day.  My understanding is the Government has already provided funding in the current Estimates for the referendum on children's rights to take place.  It is important this measure be put in place to preserve, in the eyes of the general public, the integrity of the independence of the Judiciary.I note the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey stated in his speech that "Ministers of State will take a permanent reduction of 10%", and yet in Table 1 the figure for a Minister of State is "8 per cent of remuneration".  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, might deal with the inconsistency in terms of what is being put out in the public domain.  The Minister of State did not answer the question as to why the Government felt it fair and reasonable to exempt the lower paid in the public sector from the pension levy and does not see that the same rules of fairness and equity should apply to a pay cut.  He needs to explain that measure.The key matter is that the Minister of State take on board the views of Deputies Bruton and Shatter, who produced a Private Members' Bill on the issue which is a practical measure.  From the Minister of State's comments, it would appear he agrees there is a need for a constitutional referendum.  Will he give a Government commitment on that?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I am not content with the Minister of State's response.  Basically, he accepts that the judges should take a cut in their pay, he cites the remuneration group as evidence in support of that, and he states he will facilitate a voluntary cut in the Finance Bill.Deputy Charles Flanagan, who I thought the Minister of State was including in his praise for persons with a legal background, made the worthwhile point that we do not want a league table of judges produced which will list judges who have given up their pay voluntarily and others who have not.  If the Government wants to create a situation whereby the Judiciary comes into disrepute, one creates a sort of voluntary pay-up scheme, which clearly is unsatisfactory.We should be clear-cut on this.  Either we accept the Fine Gael amendment and we take our chances in the court or we accept the alternative, which is Deputy Shatter's constitutional approach, which is clearly much more robust.We are left in the unsatisfactory position trying to debate with Government an issue that we have signalled.  The Minister of State knew we were tabling this, knew we had to respond to it and comes back in here with this clearly unsatisfactory solution — voluntary surrender in respect of, as I understand it, only the pension part, not the entire contribution, which at this stage will be probably 25% of judicial pay.The Minister of State is not adequately briefed to deal with the issue, as I understand it.  I am persuaded by listening to other colleagues that the voluntary route he is offering is not a satisfactory solution.  It leaves the Judiciary in an invidious position whereby league tables will be created. Deputy Barrett also makes an important point, namely, that if we are so ginger about what general provisions ought apply to judges — in my view, it was never the intention of the authors of the Constitution that judges would be immune from general provisions of law that affect categories of which they were only a tiny proportion — and if we take the view that we cannot touch judges in that way, surely the signal the Minister of State has given, the notion that judges should now be put into a category where they will get no further pay increases, is in breach of that principle.  That certainly singles them out for treatment.I am not persuaded by the defences the Minister of State offered.  Has the Government held discussions with representatives of the Judiciary to establish exactly its perception of Government policy in this area?  Does it see the hazards that others in the House have referred to in respect of voluntary contributions and lists of those who are in and those who are not?  Is the Judiciary four square behind the Government and its view?  We ought to know because the vehicle the Government is offering to deal with judicial pay is so strange.  What consultation has taken place?  I am persuaded that we should run with our proposal.  Either the Government should accept our proposal or we should deal with the matter in the way Deputy Shatter has pointed out.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I take Deputy Bruton's argument about the implications of singling out the Judiciary for no pay increase during the lifetime of this Government.  The precedent for this rests with Mr. de Valera in the 1930s, although it is fair to say in 1932 Mr. de Valera had greater prospects for holding office for a longer period than the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, has at present.  However it works in theory, in practice it will probably mean the Judiciary will not forgo a great amount in the months ahead.Will the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, put on record a simple answer to a simple, straightforward question, please?  Do I understand correctly that the terms of this Bill apply to everyone working in the public service who was a victim of the pension income levy and no one beyond that group?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Two issues arise in respect of these amendments.  The point Deputy Richard Bruton makes regarding the issues of consultation is important.  It would be perfectly normal for the Attorney General or very senior officials in the Department of Finance or elsewhere to tick tack with either the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice concerning the general feeling among the Judiciary about this proposal.  The Minister of State should put on record what, if any, consultation occurred between the Government and representatives of the Judiciary on this issue.  It is now placed in a difficult position whereby if its members do not give up the voluntary cut, there will be endless speculation regarding which judges have taken it.  That is not in the interests of the Judiciary nor does it serve the purpose of the separation of powers.  The Minister of State should address this issue.  What, if any, consultation has occurred between the Judiciary and the Government on this issue?  There is a historical precedent for such consultation to occur.I refer to the point raised by Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Alan Shatter concerning the views of Mr. Justice Barrington.  He has made public remarks during the past 12 months on the imposition of the pension levy on the public service.  He believed Article 35 of the Constitution does not apply directly to judges on the issue of a pension levy because people would contribute to a pension scheme from which they would ultimately draw.  I can understand to a degree the difficulty last year and the problem presented in the muddle of the budget at that stage when the matter of how judges would be dealt with was overlooked.  However, why was it not possible to include a pension levy proposal for judges in this legislation, even if there is legal uncertainty as to whether they can be included for a pension levy?  As it happens, I agree with Deputy Shatter and others that simply cutting their pay is virtually impossible to impose.  Such a move would be legally and constitutionally defective and the Government would not get away with it, even if it wished to do so.  However, there has been doubt about the Government view of pension contributions and the pension levy, to which Mr. Justice Barrington and others have referred.  Why not include that retrospective issue in the legislation before the House?  I seek clarification on these two issues.

I refer to Deputy Burton's amendment related to the Minister's clause in the finance Bill on the waiver system.  That measure will draw more broadly, rather than simply from the Judiciary.  It will achieve the same effect as the Deputy's amendment, but without running into constitutional problems.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	396	There are no constitutional problems.

It says nothing about increases in remuneration and in years gone by there would have been periods during which no increase was applied to the remuneration of judges and other categories of public servant.  It is not discriminatory to take account of past events in setting future rates of remuneration.  Indeed, this is what the review body does when considering variable rates of adjustment to the pay at higher levels in the public sector.  As indicated by the Minister for Finance, the Government route will be to establish a waiver system.  On behalf of the Government, I put on record that I hope everyone concerned will take up that waiver.  It has been reflected in the discussion and I have pointed out already that the fairness issue was dealt with by the review body and the difficulty in this regard relates to a constitutional impediment given the way in which the Constitution exists in its current format.I am not empowered to pledge a constitutional referendum but there is nothing to stop the people on the opposite side of the House from tabling a question to the Taoiseach to establish whether it is his intention to hold a constitutional referendum on any matter.  Any such matter would be addressed by the Government when an Opposition Bill reaches Second Stage.  I presume that will take place early in the new year, but that is a matter for the Opposition.

The matter will be covered.It was never the intention that names or references to which judge claimed the waiver would be mentioned but rather the aggregate numbers and amounts would be recorded.  Another question related to whether the Government's amendments would apply to persons employed by bodies with a public service pension.  As I have stated already, the application of a pension levy is a rule of thumb.  The Minister has stated there are many individuals who are in an anomalous position and if this is the case, they can be considered under the Minister's various powers under the Bill and it is just and equitable for him to do so.

The Minister of State acknowledged formally on the record of the House that the remit of this reduction in public sector salaries is far broader than the pension levy because it will apply to bodies where there is a pension scheme even though people employed or paid for by those bodies may not themselves be in receipt of a pension or be part of a pension scheme.  In other words, this applies to people such as contract teachers, part-time staff and contractors in other situations who do not have access to a public service pension or are not so entitled.  There are many such examples throughout the public service.However, by contrast with the provisions of these amendments, and despite the Minister of State's description of a war situation, unfortunately, a High Court judge on a salary of €250,000 is not being asked — or given the opportunity as would happen with the Labour Party's amendment — to offer to share positively the burden of his or her fellow citizens.  Fianna Fáil is putting the Judiciary in an invidious position simply because it wishes to create categories of exemption in order to continue to defend and protect its friends in the banks, particularly in its own bank, Anglo Irish Bank, and its, friends, the developers who are being bailed out and for whom public servants are paying the price.

However, if one looks at the third page of the Minister of State's speech, he states, concerning to whom the pay cut will apply: "In order to pin down this issue, therefore, the Minister for Finance published amendments last night to the draft Bill to clearly define who is affected by the pay reduction by linking it to their access to a public service pension scheme".  Clearly, the relevant amendments are Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8.The speech continues: "The rule of thumb therefore will be if one is affected by the pension levy the reduction to the rates of pay will also apply."  An effective interpretation of the amendment would be in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made.  That appears to be inconsistent with the fact there might be people in part-time or temporary employment or temporary full-time employment who do not qualify under the pension schemes, such as teachers.  The Minister of State and Chief Whip, Deputy Carey, said the pay cut will apply only if the pension levy applies.  Will the Minister of State clarify this point?Once again it goes back to the lower paid.  The Minister of State still has not answered my very simple straightforward question, the one being asked by the ordinary public servant.  If an exemption was given under the pension levy, why is the Government not extending that to the pay cut, in terms of consistency and fairness?  What was the Government's thinking?  Was it just a crude measure containing no policy and no thinking, the result of sitting down two days before the budget and asking,"What will get us the money in the quickest possible way?"Governments are there to lead and bring people along collectively, not to divide and conquer, an agenda this budget clearly pushes, particularly with regard to a division between the public and private sectors, especially the lower paid.Will the Minister of State deal with the inconsistencies, namely, what the Minister of State, Deputy Carey said less than two hours ago in this Chamber and what the Minister of State said just now?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I shall be brief.  I wish to return to what the Minister of State said about consultations.  He said there were consultations between the Judiciary and the Revenue Commissioners.  Were these between the Chief Justice and the Revenue Commissioners?  Who was engaged in the consultations?   Will the Minister of State say which Minister talked directly to the Judiciary about the pension levy?  Was there any indication from the Judiciary that its members did not regard the pension levy as something that fell within Article 15.5 of the Constitution?  On what basis were such discussions regarded as appropriate?  Was it simply to put in place a mechanism or was something said to put the Judiciary under pressure to make voluntary contributions?  Leaving aside the pension levy, what discussions, if any, have taken place between Government and either the Chief Justice or representatives of the Judiciary with regard to the public sector wage decrease?  Have there been such discussions?There has been talk about this.  I agree with the views and concerns expressed by my colleagues, Deputies Flanagan, Bruton, Hayes and O'Donnell with regard to the publication of the numbers of judges, who, percentage wise, are contributing to the pension levy and the new mechanism to be put in place.  That creates a league table.  If we discover that only 30% of District Court judges are contributing to it, as opposed to 60% of High Court judges, there should be greater public esteem for the High Court.  How would this work?  Regarding the mechanism to be put in place by the legislation, will the Freedom of Information Act be excluded from it?  If only percentages are to be published what access will there be to ascertain the names of individual judges?  Are we going to create some sort of public Star Chamber in which judges are pilloried because they have not contributed to this?  Are we going to allow a situation to develop which will be so fundamentally at variance with the intent of our constitutional provisions as to drive a coach and four through them?Like every other Member of this House, I receive letters from teachers and low-paid people in the public sector who feel they have been victimised by this Government.  Many of them cannot understand why people with high incomes are to contribute less by means of these emergency measures- or, in the case of the Judiciary, nothing at all  — to meet the current difficulties in which the State finds itself, having to reduce public sector expenditure and our current expenditure bill.The Minister of State said it is for Fine Gael to bring a referendum Bill before the House.  We will do so.  The Bill may come before the House early in the new year but the Minister well knows this Government has an automatic knee-jerk reaction to any legislation that comes before the House from the Opposition side.  It lets it go through First Stage so that a discussion on Second Stage can take place but 99 times out of 100 it automatically votes down everything that is dealt with in Private Members' time.  If it lets a Bill slip through in Private Members' time, it never gets dealt with in a committee.  It is controlled by the Government TDs and it never goes any further.The real question is not to let Fine Gael bring the Bill before the House but whether the Government recognises, in the interest of fairness, that we need a constitutional change to address this issue and whether the Government will support in principle the holding of a referendum with appropriate wording being put to the people because there is no monopoly of wisdom in the drafting of it.  Different wording could have been used to achieve the same result.  I do not believe, when it comes to constitutional referenda, that there are words formed on a tablet of stone that are so perfect we can never have a variant of them.  Any half decent lawyer knows that the same thing can be said half a dozen different ways to achieve exactly the same outcome.The real question is whether the Government is committed, in principle, to a referendum to address this issue so that there will not be a build-up within public opinion that it is grossly unfair that the Judiciary is excluded from application of the public sector wage decrease and that we will not see a degree of public outrage unfairly directed at the Judiciary because of the incompetence of the Government in addressing this issue.

How can the Judiciary be exempt when lower paid public servants who are contacting all of us in this House are being penalised in this Bill?  For example, I received over 100 signatures today from ordinary paid workers in the Department of Defence in Renmore, in my own parish, who cannot understand why they are being penalised while higher paid servants like the Judiciary and others seem to be exempt?  I ask the Minister if he could help me in replying to the representation I am getting on this issue.  I was asked to give the signatures to the Minister, which I will do after the debate, and express their concern and disgust with the penalty the Government is imposing on them.  I refer principally to those 100 employees in my own locality who work in the Department of Defence in Renmore.

It is an unbelievable situation for most public servants in the country.  We were informed earlier by the Chief Whip that the average rate of pay for the majority of public servants is approximately €50,000.  It is a good, but not exceptionally high, rate of pay.  It is a moderate rate of pay——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	441	——with which somebody can provide for a family and have some hope of acquiring a home of his or her own, as is right.It is extraordinary that in this Bill Fianna Fáil has used all of the ingenuity available to it, via the parliamentary draftsmen, to include in the remit of the Bill very low paid public servants, including people such as cleaners working on a part-time basis.  They will be hit with reductions in pay of a minimum of 5%.  However, when it comes to Anglo Irish Bank, the Government has used the powers and cleverness of its parliamentary draftsmen to exclude its staff from such reductions.  There has been considerable talk by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance about fairness.  As I said in the discussion on the previous amendment, the Minister for Finance has talked about war and said that we were in an economic war.  On Sunday night he said that he did not want to open a second front in the war against the public service and he did not want that war to extend to the commercial semi-State bodies.It is very difficult for most people here, including Members of this House, who are taking significant pay cuts and paying pension levies along with all the other people paid out of the public purse to have the people who are largely responsible for the cause of the war exempted by means of parliamentary cleverness.  Earlier the Government Whip said:Neither Anglo Irish Bank nor NTMA is subject to the levy.  The former does not come within the definition of a public service body covered by the Bill as it does not have a public service pension scheme.Nothing in this legislation would prevent the addition of Anglo Irish Bank and the Labour Party has obtained senior legal advices to that effect.  This is a conscious political decision by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in government to target nurses, gardaí, clerical assistants and everybody in the public service bar members of the Judiciary — which we have already discussed — and employees of Anglo Irish Bank.  Where is the fairness in that for the Minister?  Where are Fianna Fáil's republican credentials for the men of no property when the people at the very top of Anglo Irish Bank, who have had a cap on their salaries of between €300,000 and €500,000 put in place, are to a significant degree responsible for the plight we are in?  Where is the fairness and justice in that?If the Government wished, it could seek to extend the remit of the legislation to the other banks because in the various banking legislation dealing with the credit institutions and dealing with the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA, but particularly in the legislation relating to the covered institutions, the powers of the Minister for Finance are almost completely limitless.  In law he is a tsar of the covered institutions.  He is even more of a tsar in terms of his control and power over Anglo Irish Bank.Let us remember the Minister has gone around the world claiming that unlike in France and other countries, the public service in Ireland has taken these cuts on the chin, with only small demonstrations and small strikes for a day yet on the other hand there is a major commitment by the public servants themselves and public service union leaders to say they recognise that the economy is in a difficult place and they want to play their part.  The Government claims that the only falling out it has had with public servants is over the mechanism by which that burden would be shared by everybody, including public servants.However, what do we find in this legislation?  We find that Anglo Irish Bank is excluded.  Shame on Fianna Fáil for imposing a cut on nurses, teachers, special needs assistants, doctors, clerical officers, assistant principals, principal officers and Secretaries General, but excluding Anglo Irish Bank.  Where is the logic in that?  Where is the fairness in that?  It is almost as though the Minister for Finance wishes to test the resolve of public servants by trying to find out how much they will take without protesting so that he can go to France and point to the traditions of 1798 and the French Revolution but claim that we do not have that in this country.  He can claim that our public servants will take almost anything yet we will exempt Anglo Irish Bank.  In France and other countries, even the UK, there has been a serious attempt to impose restraints and conditions on bankers who have transgressed.We are not talking about the bank staff at counter level, many of whom were duped by the leaderships in their banks into putting their life savings into bank shares that are now worthless.  We are talking about the top echelons, the Seánies and others in Anglo Irish Bank, who were so friendly with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and who rushed to the Galway tent and every other Fianna Fáil function to say "There is one motherland and one fatherland".  We have Fianna Fáil on the one hand, and Anglo Irish Bank and the developers on the other hand.  This is the golden circle.  The Bill protects the golden circle yet again.Many Anglo Irish Bank staff members have lost their savings because they were invested in the bank's shares.  When I questioned him at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, Donal O'Connor, the chairman of the bank told me that people at senior management levels in the bank are heavily compromised because at the height of the property boom they became players and were taking stakes in the bank's unwise property developments.We read in today's newspapers — I wish that the Minister could deny it — that the person who has been the internal auditor at Anglo Irish Bank since 2005 has been reappointed to that position.  Perhaps that particular auditor consistently blew the whistle internally in the bank but was not listened to by his superiors in the bank.  However, it seems extraordinary given that the Government has taken control of this bank.  The bank is not permitted by the European Central Bank to lend until next July other than on roll-over projects to developers.  So we have a zombie bank and have committed ourselves to €24 billion in NAMA bonds for this bank.  We have already invested €4 billion, which we have informed the European Union and the European Central Bank is money that is gone.  We are being asked to pony up some time after Christmas — probably in late January — at least another €4 billion and up to €6 billion into a dead bank.As I have said previously, the Labour Party's reservations about the guarantee centre on two banks, Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society — a tiddlywink building society that is in for €8 billion of rescuing and €2 billion of a cash injection shortly when its special meeting is held.  Is the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, serious about excluding the party that has led to the core collapse in the reputation of Ireland internationally?  If one follows our bond spreads every day, one will find they are way over what they ought to be.  Even with the extreme financial reduction measures we are discussing today, our bond spreads are considerably higher than Italy's bond spreads because the international bond markets know that we have a mess that we have retained and Fianna Fáil has kept to itself, in Anglo Irish Bank, a bank we are nurturing along and pouring money into as if it were a dead drain.Now we find that nurses and teachers are to bear this reduction in salary while those in Anglo Irish Bank get away scot free.  If the Minister said he felt terribly sorry for the young people who went to work in Anglo Irish Bank in the last ten years, worked hard, did what they were told and were not really responsible for the mess, but he would apply the reduction to the higher paid in Anglo Irish Bank — for example, anyone earning more than €100,000 or even €150,000 — I could understand it.  One might feel sorry for the staff on the lower levels who were not responsible for what went on.  Instead, the top directors, the chairman and everyone else in Anglo Irish Bank are being protected.This Government ought to recognise the difference between right and wrong in terms of governance.  This further protection of Anglo Irish Bank is a step too far and the Labour Party is proposing that Anglo Irish Bank be included in the list of organisations to which these provisions will apply.  It is owned and totally controlled by the State.  The Bill should be amended to include those in Anglo Irish Bank in the measures being inflicted on a range of public servants to reduce their salaries.Professor Honohan yesterday indicated that he would favour a parliamentary inquiry along the lines of the DIRT inquiry, together with an oversight commission, as I suggested during the debate on the NAMA legislation.  This would bring in outside experts to tell us what went wrong in this and other banks.  What Professor Honohan has to say is welcome.  Here is the proof of whether those in Fianna Fáil can recognise financial right from wrong.  Why should everybody in the public service take the hit?  It is those in the public service, and every other taxpayer in Ireland, who are at the moment paying dearly for Anglo Irish Bank.

Professor Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, yesterday appeared before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, whose Chairman, Deputy Moynihan, is in the Chamber.  At the meeting, I asked him a number of questions, one of which was specifically about Anglo Irish Bank.  I asked whether Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance in the Irish banking system and, furthermore, whether the Irish banking system could survive without it.  His answer to the latter was an unequivocal "Yes."  The Irish Government has poured €4 billion of taxpayers' money into Anglo Irish Bank.  We supported the bank guarantee scheme, but when it came to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, we opposed it.  There should have been an orderly wind-down of the bank.  The Government continues to talk about a wind-down, but I am talking about an orderly wind-down.  These are two totally different things.Anglo Irish Bank is not of systemic importance to the Irish economy.  The ordinary person or public servant is wondering what has happened to Seán FitzPatrick, the former CEO and chairman of Anglo Irish Bank.  Why is he not being held accountable?  The transactions that went on between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society involved funds being moved between both balance sheets over a two-month period.  People find this impossible to understand.  A total of €80 million in directors' loans were kept off the balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank at the year-end.Professor Honohan said yesterday that he would apply the public sector pay cuts to staff at the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Furthermore, they should apply to the National Treasury Management Agency, which is fully State-owned.  Some 5% of the money paid to the banks by NAMA, or €2.7 billion, will be in the form of subordinated debt, but Professor Honohan stated it should have been treble that figure — 15%, which represents another €5.4 billion on top of the €2.7 billion.  However, the Minister for Finance led us to believe Professor Honohan was in total agreement with what was being proposed.What we need here is fairness and equity.  Anglo Irish Bank is fully owned by the State.  It is effectively a Government Department — a very expensive one.  We introduced a reasonable amendment, No. 18, through Deputy Bruton to deal with the issue of salary reductions, although we will probably never reach it, more is the pity.  Its effect would have been to exempt the first €30,000 of the salary of any public servant from the reduction.  Thus, anyone on €30,000 would be fully exempt, while those in receipt of a salary greater than that amount would have a reduction applied to the balance.  The pay cut should apply to the higher-paid staff in Anglo Irish Bank, but not to the many employees at the bank who are relatively low-paid.The Minister still has not answered my original question.  In the last budget, the pension levy was not imposed on the lower paid, but the Government is now imposing pay cuts on public servants earning any salary.

I am trying to give context to the debate and underpin it with thought.I support this amendment, which should apply to both Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA.  We are told NAMA should be self-financing.

There should be consistency throughout the public sector, which includes NAMA.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I support this Labour Party amendment, which exposes the fact that Government cronyism is alive and well even after the scandals in the banking sector and the property bubble which it allowed to continue.  The Government has adopted the tactic of saying Anglo Irish Bank is a commercial entity and therefore it cannot have a proper public sector pension scheme.Perhaps the Minister of State should tell us about these banks and bankers.  Does he have any idea when the inquiries into Anglo Irish Bank will be complete?  Does he know whether charges will be brought against certain people?  Does he have any information on the status of what is our bank?  Can he tell us when the large amounts of money — in excess of €83 million in the case of Sean FitzPatrick — will be repaid?  Can he give any information to the taxpayer about these matters?The last time I spoke about this issue in the House, which was last year, I outlined the case of a constituent who had ended up in Mountjoy Prison for four days for not buying a dog licence.  Yet again I have had the unfortunate experience of finding a constituent hauled off to Mountjoy Prison for a similar offence.  He was arrested in the first instance and brought to the Garda station by two gardaí.  He was then transferred to a further two gardaí to bring him to Mountjoy where he was committed by five prison staff who wrote up the committal forms and so on.  This was all for the sake of the price of a dog licence, which is around €16.  The gross injustice in this case is that the poor man did not receive the information because he is in a relatively new housing estate and An Post admitted there had been major mix-ups with the post.  The Minister of State and his Government are standing over this — a hard-working, decent man being hauled off to Mountjoy Prison for the sake of a dog licence — while these characters in Anglo Irish Bank do not merit a word.  I hope the Minister of State recognises the injustice of what is going on and can address it for us.I hope there is a good excuse from the Government for its decision not to ensure that those in Anglo Irish Bank — our bank, a public bank — fall into the category of proper public servants.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell the House when they will be recognised as public servants in the full meaning of that term.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The factor running through, this, as with earlier amendments is the question of fairness.  It highlights again in a dramatic manner how unfair the terms of the Bill are.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the majority of staff in Anglo Irish Bank.  I presume it is a fact that they had no hand, act or part in the skulduggery that went on there, which has brought the banking system to its knees and exacerbated an economy already in a downward spiral.It is amazing what the Minister can choose to include and ignore.  Can anybody in the House remind me of an occasion when a Minister brought a Bill before the Dáil and could not outline its scope?  I do not ever recall being presented with a Bill where the Minister did not know to whom it applied, but offered to give the House a "rule of thumb".  Let us re-read, for example, what Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey has to say.  He said:The simplest way in this legislation to define a person who is a public service employee, and to distinguish those persons from private sector employees, whose employment is helped by State funding, is to use the approach taken when applying the pension related deduction to link their employment to their current or potential access to a public service pension scheme.I am not sure what a potential pension scheme is and I am not sure from that definition who is included and who is excluded — the paragraphs that preceded that quotation deal with the number of people employed in the community sector, for example, who are part-funded by the State.  Whether they are included remains a mystery.  Then he goes on to summarise:In order to pin this issue down, the Minister for Finance published amendments last night to the draft Bill, which will clearly define who is affected by the pay reduction, by linking it to their access to a public service pension scheme.  The rule of thumb, therefore, will be: if you are affected by the pension levy, the reduction to the rates of pay will also apply.I apologise to the Minister of State for having had to leave the House for a few minutes to attend to another commitment.  However, does that not appear to answer the question I asked the Minister of State as regards who is covered by this legislation?  That would seem to indicate everybody who took the hit on the pension levy is covered by the terms of this second bite, but only those people.I do not believe it is good enough for the Minister of State to hope to get through this debate without telling the House who is included and who is not.  Here we have an amendment that would encompass some of the high fliers now being paid by the State, and who brought this country to the edge of ruin, and they are excluded.  However, people in humble public service positions are included and the Minister of State cannot put us in a position to reply to the e-mails we are getting from an array of organisations that want to know whether they are included.  We are now diverting these e-mails to the Minister of State's Department and apparently, the Department cannot answer them.  Will the Minister work it out over Christmas or is this a matter of making it up as he goes along?It is simply not acceptable for the Minister of State as a rational person to tell the House, in effect, "Here's a rule of thumb, and sure after that, we'll make it up as we go along".  Who is included and who is not?  Deputy O'Donnell raises a wider question, which is such an appalling vista that I do not want to look at it before Christmas, namely, how to get this albatross from around our necks.  How can we wind down in an orderly manner or otherwise this institution that has done such damage?  We included the subordinated debt holders and did not even negotiate with them as regards their taking part of the hit, and we are now stuck with Anglo Irish, like the albatross around the neck of the ancient mariner.  This economy is sinking under its weight and that still has to come at us in terms of its full impact.  I do not know who will be around to pick up the pieces, but in the interim the Minister of State should at least be able to tell us who is covered by this Bill and who is not.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I support this amendment fully.  We are talking about the entire public sector, from the most lowly paid to the highest, all of whom will be affected by the cuts.  The most lowly paid, up to €30,000, will face cuts of 5% and there was no attempt, good, bad or indifferent to have a threshold that might poverty-proof in any way the legislation we are putting through.The public sector has always said it is not in any way responsible for the economic crisis, but its members are not the beneficiaries of NAMA.  Its provisions extend only to those who were the cause of the economic crisis.  There is no bailout for the public sector while there is for those who caused the crisis.  Here is an opportunity to look at one of the institutions which caused the economic collapse, namely, Anglo Irish Bank.  This bank, because of its culture, was largely responsible for what happened within the Irish financial system.  Everybody in the financial world was in a "keeping up with the Joneses" mode, and the "Joneses" of the day was Anglo Irish Bank.Anglo Irish was doing its thing in a fraudulent fashion, hiding and moving money around the place, operating in a manner that corrupted itself, other banks and indeed the docklands in its operations.  Now Anglo is a State-owned bank, into which the State has injected €4 billion.  Is there any reason we should not include Anglo Irish Bank within the parameters of this legislation?  It simply should be done.  Symbolically, it should be done.  At least the message would go out as regards the people who were, to a large extent, responsible for the culture that brought about the bubble and the collapse, not to mention the people on the Government side who aided and abetted it.  I am not talking about the ordinary workers but the people in the dysfunctional boardroom of Anglo Irish, who were pulling the strings.  Why should they not now be included within the remit of this legislation?  It would seem to anybody who believes that some element of justice should be done that they should be included — for that reason alone, apart from having some element of sanction in place for all that they did.Almost €28 billion, nearly 50% of the money we are talking about as regards NAMA in terms of portfolios and loans, relate to Anglo Irish Bank.  That is a colossal albatross, as Deputy Rabbitte has said.  Those who earn €1 to those who earn €100,000 plus must buy into the payments that the Government is inflicting on us.  However, we cannot extend the remit to include the higher paid staff and board of directors of Anglo Irish Bank.  We should go a step further by accepting the Opposition recommendations of an Oireachtas inquiry into that particular bank.  If things were done properly, the Criminal Assets Bureau should have been knocking on the door at an early stage.  The public will have to bear the brunt of the €1.3 billion in savings that the Government has targeted in the public and social welfare sectors.  It is not too late for this House to send out the message that Anglo Irish Bank, which introduced the culture of corruption into the banking system on a large scale, should now be a recipient of the provisions of this legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I was intrigued by the Minister's statement last night when he was explaining what he was doing and why he was excluding certain commercial bodies.  He said it was because the pay of those bodies is funded through their own commercial efforts.  That is some explanation as to why Anglo Irish Bank is being excluded.  Anglo Irish Bank is on a drip-feed from the taxpayer.  It would not be in existence but for the taxpayer.  It is wrong to pretend that in some way a distinction is being drawn because this company is standing on its own two feet, exercising its commercial muscle and is subject, as the Minister said, to the disciplines of the market.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	452	It is hard to credit the arguments we are being offered to explain the exclusion of Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA from the obligations here.  It raises a wider issue, which is that we are singling out the public service for pay cuts.  The Government has decided that it will not address the commercial State bodies because it feels their industrial relations muscle is too great to take on.  Is the Government going to confront the rip-off that is occurring throughout many operations in this country?  It is not going to confront excessive commercial rents, which are killing businesses.  Nor will it confront the prices that are being paid for public utilities.  No new regime is being offered for regulators that would address how we will secure competitiveness, but there is a new regime when it comes to ordinary public service staff at the very lowest level.  Where is the equity or even the sense that we are all united in a common purpose to become competitive again?  That would allow Ireland to become an export-led economy again with strong performance in our export markets based on being nimble, adaptable, low-cost and quick to respond to opportunities.  It is simply absent.  It is not just the unfairness of low-paid people having to take cuts, but also the unfairness of not confronting the much greater obstacles that lie in the way of Ireland's economy recovering.Soft targets are being chosen here, which belies the fact that the Government is not willing to frame a vision of the deeper change that has to happen in Ireland.  That change involves confronting competitiveness on a wide front, as well as confronting reform in the public service and not just cutting pay.  The Minister has set out an agenda that requires €2 billion in further cuts next year and €2 billion in cuts the year after and €1 billion in taxes.  Perhaps it is €3 billion each year.  In 12 months' time will he ask the same people he has taken 5% off now to take another 5% then?  He must confront the issue of how Ireland will get out of this hole.  What is the medium-term plan to transform Ireland's politics, public service, economy and utilities?  That is the agenda he must work on, but that is where he has signally failed.  That is why there is so much resentment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	454	It is the context for this.  The chief executive of the Central Bank, which is listed among these agencies which are exempt, has decided that there is an emergency in this country and that he will ask his staff to take a cut.  It is not just himself and the director of the Financial Regulator — he is taking himself right out of the exemption limit that was available.  The Minister will be confirming that with a later amendment.  Where is the same sense that we are in an emergency from other agencies on that list?  Why do we decide that there is an emergency when it comes to the public service?  Why is an emergency status volunteered by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, as well they might because they were caught completely flat-footed when it came to regulating the banking sector?  Where is the same sense of emergency in Anglo Irish Bank, which was at the heart of the web of destruction that occurred?  If we are genuinely in an emergency, there must be a more broadly based effort to confront this than the narrow base offered in this Bill.I support Deputy Burton's amendment, but I also believe that in a true emergency we must confront costs that apply well beyond the public service.  That must be led in a concerted way by the Government, which we simply have not seen.  If that happened, there would be some sense that at least the sacrifice that is being asked of public service workers would be matched by others and would contribute to a greater purpose.  That is what has been singularly missing from this debate.

The plan considers all options for the future of the bank and a detailed evaluation of the plan is now under way.  The process will involve extensive consultation and dialogue between the Irish authorities, the European Commission and the bank to agree a restructuring plan for Anglo Irish Bank which will achieve the best possible outcome for the State from the process.  The outcome of the restructuring plan process will determine the future for the bank, including its required staffing levels and its staff retention and redundancy objectives, and the bank's pay levels will be determined by the board accordingly.It is clear, however, that any future strategies for Anglo Irish Bank will involve further redundancies at the bank and further cost reductions.  The bank staff do not enjoy any public service privileges in that regard.  I should stress that in seeking to reduce its cost base, Anglo Irish Bank is acting in a similar fashion to other commercial State bodies that are planning their way out of the current difficulties.  It is not the intention of the Minister to cut across any of these vitally important processes for Anglo Irish Bank, and for the State as the shareholder in the bank, in the current legislation.As Deputy Burton will be aware, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is engaged with events and with those with responsibility for what led to the events of last year.

Pay in the NTMA is determined in a manner similar to the excluded commercial State bodies and there is no Government control of pay rates.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to make the cuts.  If Deputies wish to know why the NTMA sets its own pay rates, it is because it was established as a designated debt management agency in the 1980s, outside of the Department of Finance.  This was at a time when there was serious competition for specialised staff.  In order to retain staff and reward them appropriately, it was necessary to give the NTMA flexibility to set pay rates in accordance with the market, rather than be constrained by Civil Service pay rates.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I am almost sorry the Minister of State has sat down.  He spoke about fringes and grey areas and spoke about Anglo Irish Bank at arms length.  The only way to use the word "arm" when referring to Anglo Irish Bank is to say that the bank has the poor unfortunate taxpayer and public servant in an arm lock.  It has its arm around the necks of every public servant and taxpayer in the country.  It is in the process of strangling whatever bit of economic life is left in the public servants and taxpayers.  The Minister of State described the issues around Anglo Irish Bank as a grey area or a fringe event.  It seems at times we are talking——
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I did not use the term in that context.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The Minister of State used the terms "grey area" and "fringe".  The only fringe that comes to my mind when discussing Anglo Irish Bank is some kind of fringe tragi-comedy festival of theatre.  Perhaps in his other hat, as Minister of State in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Mansergh is thinking of his theatrical experience.Without doubt, Anglo Irish Bank deserves a film of its own to recount the skullduggery and events there.  On or around St. Patrick's Day 2008, when the Anglo Irish Bank share price collapsed, everyone in the senior echelons of Fianna Fáil knew that the party was over.  What people did not know then was that all of us, public servants, cleaners, teachers, nurses, doctors, etc., would have to pay for it.  That is what the Government is doing.  In a democracy, a sense of proportion and fairness is essential to retain the consent of the people to being ruled by a Government.  The Government is bankrupt of ideas and is still seeking to protect its pals in Anglo Irish Bank and its developer pals.The point is that Anglo Irish Bank is the developers' bank and Fianna Fáil is the developers' political party.  They comprise the golden triangle.  One should bear in mind the aftermath of the St. Patrick's Day massacre that affected Anglo Irish Bank's shares and the incapacity of the Quinn family to meet the calls on the contracts for difference in which it had dabbled.  It made a loss of approximately €2 billion, according to itself.  The "Maple 10", "Maple 12" or golden circle are now sitting on tax losses of €460 million and will be able to reclaim them at some stage.The discussions between the Government and the unions apparently broke down because of the incapacity to define the 12-day lay-off due to the suggestion that it could be claimed back easily, yet the golden circle in Anglo Irish Bank has its own claim-back facility worth €460 million in respect of an unreal transaction.  As far as we can make out, it is a made-up, fake transaction on foot of which those concerned will be able to claim back €460 million associated with tax losses from now until they have made sufficient profits.  The Minister for Finance confirmed this to me in response to a recent parliamentary question.  This is like living in the world of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland where words mean what one wants them to mean.  Fianna Fáil will knock public servants and hold Anglo Irish Bank dear to its little heart and ensure that it is protected because it has a commercial mandate.Earlier, the Minister of State referred to the golden era of public service trade unions and implied the era is over.  Partnership is over but the golden era of Anglo Irish Bank is not.  Some time in the next ten years, we are to hear from the Director of the Office of Corporate Enforcement.  I am sure he is doing his best to proceed with speed but, at present, the procedure is very slow.In the United States, there was a Madoff moment and people who have been identified as having done wrong must face the courts of that country and accept the consequences of their actions.  The Irish public has endured huge cuts to social welfare, public servants have had a huge cut in their wages, there have been very many laid off in the private sector, and companies are starved of credit nationally.  Today, Fianna Fáil is dishing out more pain and one should consider this in light of its golden era of golden connections with Anglo Irish Bank and the developers.  The new motto for Fianna Fáil is not "A nation once again" but "Cherish Anglo Irish once again".

This is a complete contradiction.  Once again, clarification is required.  The Ministers of State are either making it up on the hoof, do not know exactly what they are doing or are doing a couple of solo runs.I refer the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to section 1(g)(ii), which states——

The legislation states: "under the Companies Acts in pursuance of powers conferred by or under another enactment, and financed wholly or partly by means of money provided, or loans made or guaranteed, by a Minister of the Government or the issue of shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government."  Anglo Irish Bank fits that bill.  The Government's amendment No. 5 states: "in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made."  Anglo Irish Bank falls very much within the remit of this Bill.Just as the Government acknowledged it made a mistake in raising the VAT rate from 21% to 21.5%, will it state it made a mistake in nationalising Anglo Irish Bank?  It should have carried out an orderly wind-down of the bank.  The bank is now effectively a bottomless pit and another €4 billion is required.  The European Commission is on record as saying it wants the Government to outline what it is doing to get off the pot in respect of the bank.  It must decide whether to keep it in operation or have an orderly wind-down.  The bank has not lent a red cent and will not do so.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the imposition of the cuts on the higher-paid staff in the bank.The Minister of State did not state to whom the pay cut applies.  Both Deputy Rabbitte and I raised this matter.  The Minister of State should explain why the Government changed its approach since imposing the pension levy.  Although it exempted the very low paid from the pension levy, it did not exempt them from the recent pay cut.  The Minister of State is present to represent the Government.  Telling us he has no further comments on this matter or any other matter is not good enough.  His job is to answer questions on behalf of the Government and we need answers.  Consideration of this Bill is to conclude in just over 20 minutes and we are entitled to answers.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I want to return to the question of who is covered by the Bill.  It is simply not acceptable that we should conclude all Stages of it without receiving an answer from the Minister of State.  There seems to be very little point in prosecuting the Anglo Irish Bank amendment.  The Government has decided to treat Anglo Irish Bank like the drunken uncle who turns up on St. Stephen's Day, gets at the bottle early and is locked away in the spare room to keep him out of sight of decent relatives.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Anglo Irish Bank has been put into the shade by Fianna Fáil, which wants to pretend it does not exist.  In telling us the bank is conducting its business at arm's length on a commercial basis, what does the Minister of State take us for?  As Deputy Bruton stated, the bank is on a drip feed from the taxpayer.The Government, by not wanting to include Anglo Irish Bank in the legislation, has only succeeded in muddying the waters further.  We believed we had at least established that those who had the pension income levy applied to them would now have the pay cut applied to them.  We want the Minister of State to say "to them and to them only".  It is very important that he do so.  The Minister of State is retracing his steps and saying the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, was wrong about what he said about the NTMA in his speech this morning.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated the staff of the NTMA had the pension levy applied to them, but will not have the pay cut applied to them.The only progress we have made on clarifying who falls within the ambit of this legislation has now been withdrawn by the Minister of State.  It would appear there are cases where the pension levy applies but not these proposed pay reductions.  For the life of me, I cannot think of what kind of people have a link to a potential pension scheme.  Everyone, potentially, has that link but it is a meaningless definition.The Minister of State has given us the facts of his thoroughbred background and no one on this side of the House questions his pedigree.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The least we can expect from a pedigree Minister is an answer to a simple question.  Who is covered by the Bill?  Otherwise, we will all be down in the courts, like the staff of the Central Bank recently, as the three months of the new year go by with the Department laterally deciding X, Y and Z are included in the Bill's ambit.  Other queries will emerge with chief executives of agencies being asked why they did not pass on the pay reductions.The Central Bank staff have already contested the decision.  I wonder did this influence the Government exempting them from the legislation.  The board decided the bank was in the eye of the storm, for reasons we will not go over now, and the pay reductions would apply to its staff.  The Government has taken away the exemption from the legislation and the Central Bank staff will be included.  Presumably, they will now proceed to the courts with double the commitment.  How many others will?The Minister cannot let the clock wind down by telling us amusing stories about not encountering Seánie in the tent in Galway.  The Minister is a lucky man because if he had encountered Seánie he would have probably thrust a loan upon him which he would be now repaying at exorbitant rates.

However, they are not relevant to who is covered by this legislation.  Can the Minister tell the House if it is people who pay the income pension levy and only them?  Can the Minister get a formula from his departmental officials?  If they were able earlier to correct the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey's speech, they must be able to give us a definitive formula at this stage.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is asking us to pass legislation, yet we do not know the full scale of its import.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20730	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	532	For the outsider looking in, having a good pedigree has got much to do with whether one is on or off this list.  The judges are off it as they have excellent pedigree.  We are expected to believe the reason the National Treasury Management Agency is exempt is because it has secrecy in what it pays itself.  It sets its own rates in secret and the Oireachtas does not oversee it so it cannot cut its pay rates.  That seems a bizarre test for exemption.The test seems more to be one of deciding whether the cut will ruffle feathers the Government does not want to ruffle.  Substitute teachers get no pension but they are determinedly in the cuts.  Their meagre daily allowances will be cut by 5% while the National Treasury Management Agency's staff pay rates will not be touched and are so high they must be kept secret to save the employees' blushes.There needs to be some clarity in this matter.  Last night, we were treated to the view that it was those subject to market discipline that would be outside the reductions.  Today, we find the Minister unwilling to consider Anglo Irish Bank as the most manifest case where market discipline has failed to curb its activities, yet it will be exempted.This is a levy that applies to very ordinary people.  It seems public servants with access to revenue flows, such as those with the national lottery company, a monopoly with a State mandate, are to be exempted.  How can it be conceived that they are not protected by the State guarantee of a pension?  They are equally in the same category as all the other public servants.  There is a sense of unreality about all of this.  The Government is not willing to apply some sort of scrutiny with principles of fairness and robustness.These grey areas, however, that the Minister claims legislation never tidies up would be made mincemeat of by the courts.  I cannot imagine the Minister of State saying in court: "Your honour has to remember these were the grey areas that we had to leave untouched in the Legislature."

Although the Ceann Comhairle made this ruling, we tried to stay within the order of the House by offering savings in one area to exempt the low paid.  We were informed the amendment was out of order even though it would have secured more than enough to prevent the cuts for low-paid workers.

The Government has admitted this legislation has a grey fringe.  To tell the truth, I have a grey fringe myself.  When I first came in here seven years ago, I was six foot six with a head of jet black hair down to my shoulders.  I might as well say that because that is as good a bull as the Minister of State is giving us.First, he tells us about the various criteria and how, if one determines one's pay rates, one can avoid paying this levy.  One is not exempt if one has access to a public service pension scheme or a potential public service pension scheme, as Deputy Rabbitte pointed out.  Then we discover the National Treasury Management Agency does have access to a public service pension scheme but it will still be exempt from the reductions.  What will the Minister do now?This is make-it-up-as-we-go-along, back-of-the-envelope stuff.  Will some Members here a bit longer than me tell me has it always been this bit of a joke in here with not defining legislation and explaining it as a grey fringe?  How does the Minister believe he will get away with that?Will those Members longer in this House explain — later on over a cup of tea will do — was it for this that I advocated changing Sinn Féin policy to recognise the Dáil?  I am actually quite concerned about this.  In 1986, I was involved in a major debate within our organisation to recognise this institution on the basis that the people recognise it and here is where we need to be to do politics.  Here I am now and I cannot believe a word the Minister says.  He cannot give us an accurate answer to any of the questions asked.For the last time, will the Minister clarify who will be exempt from these pay cuts and who will be liable for them?  Can we have some clarity please and never mind the grey fringes?

It is quite clear they are not public servants and there is no grey area there whatsoever.The allegation was made that Fianna Fáil is a developers' political party.  We are a political party for all the people.  The point needs to be made that, notwithstanding the gross excesses there have been, development is beneficial.  All of us in this House should be about economic and social development.  I reiterate the point that public servants enjoyed from 2000 to 2007, in terms of enhancement, numbers and incomes, the best period they have had since independence and are, probably, likely to enjoy again under any Government in the foreseeable future.The golden era of Anglo Irish Bank is long over.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on this important issue tabled by Fine Gael in Private Members' time.  The Fine Gael motion is very important because it has focused on some of the key areas in the budget again, especially changes to the benefits to the blind, the disabled and carers.  These are areas no one would have expected any Government to hit or target with cutbacks.  Fine Gael has sought to have these cuts redressed and I fully support the proposal.  We are all aware of the nature of the budget at this stage and that the Government has gone out of its way to target the least well off in society, including those on social welfare across the board, whether the blind, deaf, disabled, carers, widows or those on supplementary allowance.  The Government has targeted everyone.  Child benefit and jobseeker's allowance has been targeted as well.  All of these areas have been hit savagely.We have just finished debating the Bill on public sector pay.  The public sector has been targeted again in a similar fashion, irrespective of the amount earned by any public sector worker.  From the lowliest labourer, the clerical worker or the first-time employee, whether such people earn greater or less than €30,000, whether part-time or otherwise, every euro such people earn will now be subject to a minimum of a 5% cut.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Government has provided for such measures.Even more unfairly, next year, the year in which this budget will become operational, will be the European Union year of combating poverty and social exclusion.  Was the Government aware of this when it decided to target the poor, those who will face poverty and those who are socially excluded?  It should have been moving in the opposite direction.The Cabinet handbook requires poverty-proofing but that did not take place.  The handbook was thrown out the window.  In addition, the Lisbon treaty, to which we have recently signed up, requires similar poverty-proofing for all legislative activities of the European Union.  The European Union must take cognisance of the impact of all legislative proposals on people and communities and it must ensure that any such proposals do not adversely impact on such people.  That has been disregarded totally as well.This is an unfair and divisive budget, probably the most unfair and divisive in the history of the State.  I do not believe anything has been so divisive since the Civil War of 1922.  I have no doubt bitterness will be engendered by this budget that will carry on for many years and decades to come.  It will have the same impact as taking the shilling from the old age pensioners.  However, in addition to targeting the poor and less well off, the budget is also very divisive because it targets one section of society and lets another section off scot free.No attempt was made to deal with those responsible for the economic crisis we now face; the bankers and financiers we discussed only minutes ago made the decisions that almost ruined the country and brought it to its knees.  Nothing was said about the inability of this legislation to bring Anglo Irish Bank within the remit of public sector provisions even though it is now a State bank, having been nationalised.  Notwithstanding that, the mandarins in the Department of Finance and the Fianna Fáil Cabinet have decided that Anglo Irish Bank, which brought about so much of the culture of corruption that came into this country regarding financial matters, will be immune from any attempt to extract tax in order to make up the €1.3 billion that must be made up by the public sector.One sector in Irish society is burdened with the entire load of trying to balance the books, and that is totally unfair.  To top that, we find that those people referred to in the Bill, the blind, the disabled and the carers, will be deprived of the Christmas bonus.  Even that element of Christmas cheer that enabled people to buy those extra things at Christmas, deal with bills and provide that extra bit that tided them over the difficult winter months, will not be available.  This is a double whammy hitting the poor.  This is Scrooge doubled.  It will be a miserable Christmas for all the people this Government has targeted to help ensure the balancing of the budget takes place.Medical cards are being delayed to such an extent at present that a great number of poor and disabled people are without medical card coverage.  There is the extra charge on prescriptions whereby people must pay per item.  The same delay applies to rent subsidies where accommodation needs that are determined by the local authority are taking forever to be determined.  We have a system that delays inordinately.  With the demoralisation and decimation taking place in the public sector, there is no doubt the system will become further delayed and ordinary people will find that normal processing of their statutory entitlements will not take place for long periods of time, for months.  Every Deputy in the House has had complaints in that regard.Of course, there is a better way which the Government should have taken.  It was proposed by the trade union movement and came from this side of the House.  Those proposals would not have allowed such targeting to take place.  However, this has happened, but we would like at least a reversal of the most severe and savage hits that have taken place.  This Private Members' motion proposes that at the very least the Government would look again at this matter.  A relatively small amount of money is required which the Government could easily make up from other sources.  We repeatedly outlined those areas where the Government could look for extra money if it were minded to do so.  It could at least try to bring some cheer to those who are at the lowest end of the scale, the disabled, the carers and the blind.  We could add to that list of people very easily but it should be possible to ensure that these sectors do not continue to be the recipients of the brunt of this budget.We are facing the European year of combating poverty and social exclusion and I do not know what our Government will do when it is asked by the European Commission what steps it has taken to combat poverty and social exclusion.  If the Government heads off to Europe and presents its budget for 2010, how will the European Commission, Parliament, Council of Ministers or Council take to that?  It would present a very negative reflection on Ireland's commitment to dealing with the problems it faces.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I believe I have ten.Yesterday, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, entered the debate by explaining the reasons for the Government's decisions regarding the reductions in some social welfare payments.  I will not go over all of that except to say I agree with the Minister's presentation and support what she is doing.My area of responsibility is disability and mental health and it is clear some of the proposed reductions will affect people with disabilities.  Some months ago when I took this position in the Department of Health and Children, I made clear to all groups representing disabilities and mental health issues that the last thing the Government would do was to hide behind the recession or try to reduce services by making the excuse of harsh economic times.  The budget was crafted to a level that gives belief to people in the disability and mental health sectors that the Government is keeping faith with its commitments in the programme for Government and the national disability strategy.I do not intend to use the few minutes I have to outline the funding that is still in place but at the same time it is very important to explain at every opportunity to people in the disability and mental health sectors the deep commitments and proposals that remain intact.  In the past 15 months I have met, on a weekly basis, at least three or four groups representing the two sectors and have given clear commitments of what we should do for the future.  Regarding mental health, I committed to securing a multi-annual capital programme and I am thankful to say it is now in place.  In the disability sector, while I acknowledge the difficulties within the economic sector in recent times, at the same time it is important to acknowledge the work done by the service providers 365 days per year.  I try to show a serious commitment remains by pointing out that in spite of a very serious economic decline the renewed programme for Government reaffirms our commitment to the area of disability.There was consistency regarding this sector and the budgetary debate.  Some €3 million was provided in this budget for an innovation programme to ensure that people with disabilities could make the transfer from institutionalised care to residential care in the community.  Again, it is a matter of trying to underline that even though we are in difficult economic times our commitment remains.  During last year it was brought to my attention by many of the voluntary groups, Inclusion Ireland in particular, that the Government was not providing funding for the inspection of children with disabilities who were in residential care.  This point was made to Government on many occasions and it is fair to point out that in the budget commitment funding was approved for this specific area.I am trying to bring balance to this debate by saying that, on the one hand, there have been cuts under the social welfare code affecting the disability and mental health sectors but, on the other, there is also provision to retain the strategy.A total of €1.6 billion is set aside by Government for the disability sector.  Some months ago I announced a review of this sector, but I want to reaffirm the senior Minister's commitment, and that of the Government, that this will not be a device to secure funding or divert funding to some other black hole in the health sector.  I have given a public commitment that anything saved by this value for money review will remain within the disability sector.  That confirms that while we are in harsh economic times, nevertheless, the underlying programme commitment remains.  To prove that this is not a device to divert funding, I have insisted that two people from the disability sector be appointed to the review committee and I am pleased the two people concerned have accepted the appointment.In terms of where the disability and mental health sectors go from here following the recent budget, I take the point made by Deputy Costello regarding the need to poverty-proof the Cabinet handbook in this area, but it is fair to make the point also that the Secretaries General of the five sectors involved in this area are also working with Government to ensure that we adhere to the commitment we made in the disability sector.  I am pleased to say we remain loyal to the commitment that 7,000 people with disability would be at work by 2010.It is fair to make the point also that by changing the support structure in that specific area, the disability sector is acknowledging that is the position we are moving toward.  Also, even though there have been cutbacks in the sector, there has been a 15% increase by way of disability grants by local authorities to the disability sector and to the elderly.It is important also to state, and this has been accepted by many people I meet who have disabilities, that even though we are in a difficult economic time, we must prepare a five-year programme which must take into account funding for housing for people with disabilities, ensure that the job commitments we have made are realised and, more importantly, and this is the most important aspect in terms of my sector, that the review we have announced is not just a way of saving money.  It is well known that the disability sector is concerned to ensure that the review we speak about is not just a money saving exercise.I want to refer briefly to the retention and promotion of policy in the education area in the recent budget and the retention of our commitments to fund education.  The renewed programme for Government announced in 2009, which is supported in the budget, commits the Government to further investment in the development of services for pupils with special educational needs.  It is fair to make the point that this is a significant achievement in a time of reduced public spending.  The renewed programme commits to the expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by the National Educational Psychological Service.I am not trying to hide the fact that funding has been reduced but the overall plan for the future is to assure the disability sector in terms of the objectives of the review now in place, and I want to thank Mr. Crowley for accepting the position as chair, and ensure that the report will be with the Government before the end of March.I speak directly to the disability sector when I say that, notwithstanding the motion before the House, which specifically refers to certain reductions, the current review will examine the disability services in Ireland funded by the Health Service Executive, including the statutory and non-statutory sectors; deliver a comprehensive analysis of data in regard to services and service providers; review current policy objectives; and provide policy objectives for future service provision.  I expect this review will be completed by March and in terms of what we will be announcing some time in February by way of job promotion, it is not just a clearing of policy, so to speak.  It will become a regional drive on behalf of the Government to involve entrepreneurs, business people, the State and semi-State sectors and local authorities in ensuring that we deliver upon that commitment.The strategy recognises that we are living in difficult times and is consistent with the principles in A Vision for Change on the mental health side.  The drive will be toward ensuring that we maintain a base level of funding to retain what was achieved in better times.I will conclude by echoing what the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, said last night.  No Minister or Deputy on this side of the House is in the business of making life difficult for people in receipt of social welfare payments, but there is also a responsibility to ensure that the economy arrives at a point where we can maintain levels of service for those in receipt of social welfare.  The difficult decisions were made in that context.  People should stand back and consider, first, that funding that has been retained, second, earmarked funding has been added to and, third, the national disability strategy remains in place and will continue to be supported.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, for sharing his time in this fashion.  I am glad to have a few minutes to speak on the issue.  I am sorry Deputy Costello has left the Chamber because he asked what we would say to Europe when it comes a-calling to find out what we were doing to eliminate poverty in 2010, which will be the eliminate poverty year.  When it comes a-calling, we will say that in a time of very difficult economic circumstances, even allowing for the changes we have provided in the Social Welfare Bill, €21.1 billion will be spent on social welfare in 2010, which is €676 million or 3.3% more than what is expected to be the outcome figure for this year.  We will be telling Europe that we are budgeting 3.3% more for 2010 than we budgeted for 2009.I remember from my time in education when they would talk about cuts, yet the expenditure would have increased.  That is the case this year with social welfare.  Expenditure has increased by 3.3%, but nobody wants to talk about that or recognise that it has happened in a time of great difficulty.I want to mention the carers because like every other Deputy in this House we all met with groups of carers in recent months not just at the centralised arrangement which took place in Buswell's Hotel, but also at local level.  There is a carers' representative in the midlands and she came to see me at my clinic with a group of people who were in receipt of the half-rate carer's allowance.  The thrust of their argument was that they would be left with the half-rate carer's allowance.  I remember it distinctly because they were vehement in their exhortations to me that they would be left with the half-rate carer's allowance.  For some reason, a rumour went around that the half-rate carer's allowance was to be abolished, bearing in mind that it only came in in 2007, and I suppose they thought it would be targeted for removal in 2009 but it was not, and I am happy it was not.There were no cuts in the carer's allowance or other allowances for those over 66 and the half-rate carer's allowance was retained, and there has been great acknowledgement of that.I freely admit this has been in the midst of receiving many telephone calls, or meeting disgruntled people, perhaps from mothers with children in particular.  While I accept this, I also accept that child benefit rose greatly in recent years and simply could not continue to rise in such a fashion.  In particular, I wish to record that I have met people who have told me they were glad the half-carer's allowance was kept as a payment.  I also wish to pay tribute, because from desultory and brief conversations with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, in recent months——

I know she worked very hard night and day to ascertain how, even in the midst of cutbacks, she could bring about equity or fairness for people, particularly those with young children, and she has done so.Interestingly, as I travelled somewhere last Sunday evening, by chance I heard on the car radio the vice-president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Professor John Monaghan, who appeared on a programme the name of which I cannot recall but which is broadcast at 6 p.m. on a Sunday evening.  In his opening remarks, before getting into what one might call the tough stuff, he wished to acknowledge immediately the significant efforts of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, towards ensuring that in the case of people with young children who lost child benefit initially, it would be made up by the increased qualified child allowance, as well as by family income supplement, FIS, for those who are eligible.  The Acting Chairman is making faces at me.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	568	It is important in the context of this debate again to remind oneself of the background to the budget and the difficult job faced by the Government and by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in particular, who was trying to protect a budget on which there were more calls and demands because of the economic recession in which we now find ourselves.  The Minister is to be complimented on fighting the good fight and on securing an increase in real terms on her budget for 2010.  In so doing, because of the increased demands arising in particular from the increase in jobseekers, the Minister was obliged to make savings in other areas.  Having spoken to and listened to her, it is clear that she tried to minimise the effect of these cuts and she has succeeded in so doing.  By common consent, everyone is agreed that given the funding that was made available to her and the savings she was obliged to make, she did, in so far as was possible, protect those who are most vulnerable, that is, families and, in particular, families with children.As 2010 approaches, Members should remind themselves again that the Minister has secured and will pay out €676 million more than she did in 2009.  The choices before the Minister were stark and it is important to recall what she has achieved in this regard.  While some benefits are being reduced by 4.1%, in that context, it is important to recall that over the past 12 years, successive governments have delivered unprecedented increases in social welfare payments.  During that time, the jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance have both increased by 130%, while the carer's allowance for those aged under 66 and the one parent family payment have increased by almost 150% and 130%, respectively.  Moreover, it should be recalled that over the same period, the cost of living has only increased by 40% and, consequently, a real increase was experienced by those who are unfortunate to be dependent on social welfare.Even throughout the economic difficulties of the past two years, the Government has done its best to prioritise social welfare.  The October 2008 budget provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates at a time when inflation for 2009 was expected to be 2.5%.  Consequently, an increase was awarded that was above the rate of inflation.  However, it is now the case that the consumer price index has fallen and that a real benefit has arisen to those who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  Consumer prices have now fallen to the same levels that obtained almost two years ago in February 2007.  After the budget of 2010, the lowest weekly rate of payment for those aged between 25 and 66 will be €10 per week higher than they were in February 2007.  Next year, the State will still spend €21.1 billion on social welfare, which comprises a significant part of total Government expenditure and will remain so.  Consequently, it is important to acknowledge that the Government is still committed to assisting and helping, where possible, those who need help.I believe the Government was correct to deliver such significant increases in welfare payments when the resources were available over the past 12 to 14 years.  However, in the current economic environment, it simply is not possible to continue to spend at the same level as when tax revenues were much higher.  Members will have noted the decline in tax revenues and I understand they are levelling off at present and hopefully may increase next year.  Unless the Government takes steps now to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances, we risk making the economic situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients, in the long term and the choices it would be necessary to make in the 2011 budget would be far more stark.It also is important to remember that a technical analysis carried out by the Department of Finance has suggested that between October 2008 and October 2009, a 3.25% fall was experienced in consumer prices for retired householders.  Moreover, a consumer price fall of 5.75% was experienced by unemployed householders, while the equivalent consumer price fall for working householders was 7.5%.  Therefore, while decreases in the cost of items such as mortgages and cars will naturally have had a greater impact on higher-income families, the overall cost of living also has dropped for low-income families in general.One area the Minister did not cover in her contribution last night and which must be addressed is the critical situation arising for householders who find themselves with one or both partners out of work and who hold large mortgages.  There is genuine concern in this regard and I know I am not the only Member who has been approached by individuals and families seeking assistance, help and advice on how to deal with significant mortgage arrears and who now are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  I hope the Government will address this issue early in 2010.  While it has been far too preoccupied with securing a successful budget, which it now has done, this issue will have social consequences.  It is a serious worry to many families in which one or both partners had secure jobs in better times but who now find themselves with a severely reduced income or with no income at all, apart from social welfare benefits.As for young people signing on for jobseeker's allowance, I support the Minister in her innovative proposal that young jobseekers coming on the live register must now register for training or educational places.  It is a positive measure.  We should be up-skilling and re-skilling.Young people, in particular, should not lose the opportunity, when they are unemployed, to get an education or learn a trade.  I am glad FÁS has committed to increasing the number of training places and I welcome the opportunities this will afford to young unemployed people.  They will benefit from such programmes.  I commend the Minister and Government for minimising the effect of the savings which had to be made in the social welfare budget.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  When one gives somebody something which he or she becomes dependent on, it is very difficult to take it back.  Nobody on this side of the House welcomes or wants to see any kind of cuts, in particular to the areas we are discussing tonight, but we have to balance cuts with the €2.1 billion we will spend next year in these areas.  In fairness to the Minister, the choices were stark and difficult.There is an acceptance that payments have vastly improved in these areas over the past number of years and particularly over the past five or six years.  There have been significant increases and people have trotted them out in the House on numerous occasions.  I have spoken to many different groups and individuals since the budget.  There is a general acceptance that we are where we are.  The reality is that if we did not make these choices now, the chances are that the cuts which would have had to be made next year would have been savage.  This part of the budget, while a large part, is still only part of the overall budget.  The choices which had to be made were made to minimise, as much as possible, the effect the changes would have on peoples' lives.On the two areas we are discussing, the value of carers and their families was recognised by this side of the House many years ago.  A lot of work has gone into improving supports, training and facilities for carers, in particular since 1997, as have supports for the representative groups of carers.  We have all dealt with them, as previous speakers have said.  Every Deputy in the House was contacted by a group or organisation on behalf of carers.  The fact the Minister managed to maintain the half-rate carers allowance is an indication that she listened to the many groups she met regarding this issue, something which has come across in the social welfare budget for this year.We have made significant changes regarding people with disabilities.  I have spoken to many individuals and groups who, for whatever reason, have to avail of disability payments.  They accept that over the past number of years things have improved.  I remember discussing with my former colleague, the late Senator Tony Kett, who worked hard and diligently in the area of disability, the Disability Acts as they passed through the House.  Major changes were fought for by individuals and groups representing people who needed extra support and a hand up, something which they did not receive until a number of years ago.  They were ignored for many years by successive Governments, but that has changed.The fact is the choices made were made for a reason, namely, to ensure that next year we can continue to pay the allowances and grants which are needed and to support those who need it most.  In fairness to the Department and the Minister, every effort is being made to ensure that those people who need help the most receive it.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	571	It is amazing to hear Government Ministers and Deputies coming in here one after the other to say how fantastic it was to able to give increased payments to people on disability, carers and people who are blind during the past number of years.  They seem to justify the current cutbacks by pointing to the increases which were given in the past.  Are they saying the increases given in the past were wrong, not needed or unjust and are now being taken back?  I am sure they would not agree with that question.  What has changed?Obviously, there are major economic difficulties out there.  However, the Government has made a choice to target people with disabilities, carers and people who are blind in this budget.  I was shocked when I saw this happening.  I could not believe it when I saw it in the Budget Statement and thought it could not be true.  We have had many debates on people with disabilities and the problems they face.  The Central Statistics Office maintains that the risk of poverty for people with disabilities is 37% higher than the rest of the population.  Some 55% of people who are at risk of poverty live in households headed by a person who is outside the labour force, that is, a person in a caring role, a person suffering from a disability or an older person.People with disabilities already face a number of higher costs.  The National Disability Authority proposed a number of years ago that an extra cost of disability allowance be given to people with disabilities.  This was not done, even though it has been called for time out of number.  What has the Government done?  It has decided, instead of giving extra money in the budget, to take it away.  It justifies the measure by saying it gave a lot of money in the past and now it can take it away.  That is cock-eyed logic which does not make sense.  The money and support involved were needed in the past and should not be taken away now.  It was the right thing to do then and the wrong thing to do now.Before I came into the House I spoke to a carer who is caring for her husband who is in a wheelchair.  They are angry and very worried because of the shift in the policy of the Government.  Until now, this House was united in the need to look after the most vulnerable in our society, but that has now changed.  The Government has decided to target these people and take from them what they need the most.The Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability issues and mental health, Deputy John Moloney, spoke some time ago about the national disability strategy.  He is very sincere and hardworking.  However, the national disability strategy has been abandoned and no longer exists.  It was composed of the Disability Act and the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which have been postponed indefinitely.  They were the two central planks in the strategy.  I was involved in the debates here and the passing of the Acts by this House.  We worked very hard on them and many people came into the House to make presentations on them.The personal advocacy service, which was due to come into place in 2008 to assist people who were blind and suffering from intellectual disabilities and autism in accessing services, has been abandoned.  In March this year, the national carers strategy, which was promised for many years, was abandoned.  A review has been set up, but where is the strategy?  It does not exist.  Let us stop fooling people.  Let us not trot out all these Acts, etc.  Deputy Cyprian Brady, who just left, mentioned the Disability Act.  Perhaps the Minister of State opposite might let him know at some stage that it has now been postponed indefinitely and that, effectively, it does not exist anymore.We were told that the multi-annual investment programme consisted of €900 million from 2006 to 2009.  I challenge the Minister of State opposite and any other Minister to lay before the House a detailed account of what has happened to that money.  I have been trying for some time, but cannot get it.  Much of it has been diverted and much of it may never have existed.  I have asked for information on it through parliamentary questions and other debates; it does not seem to exist.  I believe something is really wrong there.  In his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General criticised the HSE on this issue.  He said that the accounting procedures were all wrong.  It is serious if all that money was supposed to have been provided and it was not pinpointed for people with disabilities.  It is now impacting on services that were supposed to have been provided to people with disabilities.By cutting the money people are getting, the Government is imposing further hardship on them.  A lot of sleight of hand is going on here.  What do we get?  In spite of all the debates we have and all the legislation that was introduced, the Government has abandoned all that and set up another review.  My concern is that this review will be solely about cutting back further on funding and support for people with disabilities instead of cutting back on the quangos the Government has established.  It puts all its friends on boards and pays them large sums of money just because, as the former Taoiseach said, they were his friends.  The policy and philosophy that exists on the other side of the House is to see whom it can put on a particular board and give him or her bonuses, directors' fees and all the rest of it.  It has no difficulty taking money from people with disabilities so that these people can get all this money.Many of the organisations that are doing considerable good work are finding the cutbacks are already impinging greatly on the work they are doing.  I call on the Government to reconsider.  People with disabilities and their carers cannot protest outside here because in this weather they cannot get away to do it.  The Government knew what it was doing and knew that if it targeted these people they would not protest in the middle of winter.  It was the one group it could really hit and get away with it.  That is what it did and it is an appalling shame.  Of all the choices it could have made, this was the wrong one.

Since the Budget Statement was delivered in the House last week, many people have contacted my office.  Deputy Stanton is right in what he said about the people the Government hit.  The blind, people with disabilities and carers are the people who cannot represent themselves.  The Government got a major lesson last year when it tried to take the medical card from the over 70s and when those people protested outside this House.  If the people whose social welfare payments were cut last week had the health and ability to be able to come out and show their vengeance against the Government, I have no doubt that it would reverse the social welfare cuts and support the Fine Gael motion before the House tonight.Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the so-called Independents have hit the most vulnerable in society, carers, the blind and the disabled.  I have observed Fianna Fáil in recent years.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, whom people thought was great, was the man who was meant to look after people with disabilities.  He introduced the Disability Act and was a champion for people with disabilities.  Many of the Members opposite were the same.  These were the people who stood up for people with disabilities.  It is unbelievable that they have cut allowances for blind people.  I was given a gift in life, the gift of sight.  Unlike me, many others were not given that gift.  I would have liked the Minister to have closed his eyes when walking from his office to the Chamber on budget day in order to feel what it would be like to be blind for that five-minute walk.  I wonder if he might have changed his mind then.I met a group of carers a number of months ago.  Their commitment to their loved ones is something I have never previously witnessed.  The work they do and the commitment, care and attention they give their loved ones is unbelievable.  Ministers sat around the Cabinet table and supported the budget, and when it came to the Government backbenchers they also supported it.  It is unbelievable how some of these people can talk out of both sides of their mouths.  With all their utterances about people with disabilities, carers and the blind, if they had any standards in politics, they would have spoken out against the budget and voted against it.  Earlier tonight, Deputy M. J. Nolan from Carlow spoke about how the savings needed to be made and the Minister played the cards she had been dealt.  It was absolute rubbish.While I might have heard Deputy Cyprian Brady wrong, I believe he asked whether they would get this money back.  However, these people will never get the money back.  It must be most annoying for people to see millions of euro being given to the banks, electronic voting machines, PPARS in the health service and the pensions and wastage of money in FÁS.I am very lucky not to have a member of my family or anyone connected to me who is blind.  My mother was a carer for my father and I know the work she put in and the commitment she gave my father before he went into a nursing home.  No member of my family has a major disability.  However, I know plenty of people who have family members with disabilities.  It is unbelievable that the Government would do what it did last week and that a Minister would have the gall to cut the social welfare benefits of people who are blind or have major disabilities and of carers.  While most of the Members opposite have not bothered to come in for the debate, if they are listening on their monitors and if they have any heart at all, I ask them to support the Fine Gael motion tonight.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I do not think it will have any impact whatsoever.Before the budget, there was widespread agreement that €4 billion needed to be taken out of the economy.  There was recognition that the quantum of money was important.  However, how the cuts were to be made was equally important.  Where would the spending cuts be made?  What priorities were to be established?  What incentives or disincentives would be put in place or removed?  They are important for two reasons.  First, we had to establish that whatever the Government was to do, it would be fair — otherwise, it would not gain acceptance among the public, of whom we are asking quite a lot — and, second, cuts and spending decisions must be targeted in such a way that they are counter-cyclical.  That is the big flaw in the budget.  Ideally, the budget should change economic behaviour so that at the end of next year, when we face another budget, we will not face even more difficult choices.  The Government's actions have simply reinforced the cycle of economic decline, making even more drastic cuts necessary next year.  That is my major criticism of the budget: we are asking people to take all this pain for virtually no gain.Cutting social welfare for able-bodied people of working age may change economic behaviour by making people more anxious to look for work or willing to take work they would not otherwise have considered.  However, cutting benefits for carers and blind and disabled people will not change their behaviour.  After the cuts they will still be blind or disabled or carers.  All the Government has achieved is to make life much more difficult for them.  We have asked them to take a disproportionate share of the burden.  It is not just the loss of €8.50 a week; they are also facing other cuts.  They are bearing a disproportionate burden compared to the able-bodied, particularly in the area of health.  The increase in the excess on drug payments, the introduction of prescription charges and the reduction with regard to dental treatment will all fall more heavily on this sector.Since the recession began, we have all denied responsibility for it.  Nobody has put their hands up — not the bankers, not the Government.  Everybody else is to blame except ourselves.  However, it has never been suggested that the blind, the disabled or carers had anything to do with what was visited upon us.  We all, to some extent, see ourselves as victims, but I do not think anyone would deny that these people are utterly blameless victims and should not have to suffer a disproportionate share of the cuts.Cuts have to be made, but the Government can make choices about where they are to be made.  There are two areas in particular in which they should have been made.  For months before the budget was introduced — even before the McCarthy report came out, but mostly after it came out — the media, the newspapers and the politicians in the pubs were worrying about where the cuts would fall.  What quangos would be abolished, what administration would be streamlined, what bureaucracies would be got rid of?  It turned out to be none.  None at all.  It was all a distraction — a trifle to keep us amused while the Government got on with what it was going to do anyway.  It was merely softening up public opinion.  In fact, the Government had no intention of making any of those changes.Ultimately, it is business as usual.  We still have major waste and outdated programmes and processes.  To sustain that kind of spending into the future, we are cutting benefits to the most dependent.  Most reprehensible of all is that the Government did nothing to reduce the actual numbers on social welfare.  In fact, it planned for an increase in the number drawing social welfare benefits.  Of course, that number can only grow in the absence of a jobs stimulus package, which should have been at the heart of this budget.  Only economic growth can take us out of this hole and stem the tide of unemployment and emigration.  Only economic growth will ensure that we can continue to support carers and blind and disabled people.  However, there is nothing in this budget that will achieve that.  All we have done is to reinforce the downward cycle and ensure that the contraction in the economy will be even greater next year.

This tax, which is absolutely counterproductive, was retained despite all the advice from business groups and the Government's own advisers, including the tourism renewal group and, this month, the National Competitiveness Council.  It is madness for an island country dependent on inward travel to bring in tourists — and, indeed, for ordinary business purposes — to deliberately make access more difficult and expensive.  We stand idly by while our airlines move out of Ireland to support tourism in the UK and mainland Europe.  Even today, Ryanair announced that it is to open its 38th foreign base, in Malaga, and not one flight will be into Ireland — they are all going to other European countries.  The only result of this is to put thousands more on the dole around the country and, worst of all, to ensure that the Government will have to impose further cuts on the most vulnerable people in the community.I ask the Government to consider all these issues and to try to put the economy at the heart of this budget.  It must ensure that we have fewer people on social welfare and that those who are on social welfare can be looked after.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I thank Deputy Naughten for tabling this motion.  It is significant in its symbolism and a watershed in terms of the political period in which we find ourselves.  People at the most vulnerable end of the spectrum are being targeted in the budget.  This sets a dangerous precedent and we need a debate on the issue.Deputy Kehoe hit the nail on the head in terms of people mobilising in some form of protest against these cuts.  We as politicians are trying to gauge the mood of the people in response to the budget.  I am detecting varying degrees of feeling, from ambivalence to betrayal.  If this budget had come out six months ago, we would have had to contend with an angry public.  We must question the lifespan of the public's anger.  Six months ago we would have had demonstrations on the street.  We must ask why this is not happening now.  The danger is that we have entered a phase of ambivalence, apathy and disenchantment among society.  This is something of which we must be cautious, but the Government has completely failed to realise it.Anger can be mobilised through demonstrations and so on.  It manifests itself in different ways.  A vulnerable group is being targeted and that is a dangerous situation.  From speaking to people in my constituency and trying to gauge the mood of people who are unemployed and in employment, I believe this sense of betrayal and apathy will, in the future, be manifested in a dangerous way.  Young people who have graduated from college with skills and have been in employment are looking to Canada and Australia.  Emigration is back on the agenda.  We find ourselves at a dangerous crossroads.Another thing I have heard in the last week, since the budget was announced, is that people who bought property at the high end of the market feel there was no hope offered to them in the budget.  There was no way forward for those who find themselves in negative equity.  This feeling is combined with the reaction to the proposed cuts to the incomes of the vulnerable.  There are varying degrees of vulnerability, but, in addition, many groups are involved.  There are people who have been let down by the Fianna Fáil-led Government that has been in power throughout my lifetime in politics and those who were let down by the banks.  We can talk in political jargon, but what people cannot understand is how we can take from the vulnerable yet continually give to the banking sector.  We heard about €6 billion being thrown out in the last week to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank.  That is what does not make sense to the public.What the Fianna Fáil-led Government has done over the past ten years is to completely ignore and disregard the ordinary word on the street.  This does not have to be uneducated; it is actually the most educated opinion.  The word on the street over the past ten years was that the property boom could not last and was not sustainable.  However, the word on the street is now silence.  That is the danger in which the Government now finds itself.  Silence is a very dangerous concoction in the field of politics and in terms of trying to get us out of the current situation.  That is something we must be aware of and we on this side will help to devise and create a new script that is needed to bring this country into the future.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I support this motion for common sense and decency, and I greatly regret that the Government has decided to cut these welfare payments for people who are so vulnerable, namely, the blind, the disabled and carers.  Earlier today new figures were published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, regarding the Quarterly National Household Survey, which tells us a great deal about the labour market.  It gives us some background to the difficulties these people are experiencing and it tells us that employment fell by 185,000, or 8.8%, which is unprecedented.  Unemployment went up by 120,000, so that means two thirds of those who lost their jobs became unemployed.  The remaining one third left the labour market and emigrated, because they had somewhere to go.The figures show that men lost their jobs almost 3.5 times faster than women in the past 12 months.  Two thirds of the men who left the labour force were under the age of 25.  They tell us, instructively, that 11,000 females left the labour force, but that 25,000 females under 25 left the labour force.  Female workers were, therefore, able to find some new jobs in the labour force and came into it, but the young people are going.  Some 60,000 people under the age of 25 left this country in the last 12 months, equivalent to a 94% drop in the labour force.  I lament the fact that these people are going, but they are lucky because they have decided they are able to go.  In the situation we find ourselves, where prosperity has been destroyed, hopes ruined and jobs are hard to come by, these people at least are able to seek new opportunities elsewhere.  Not so for the blind — it is very difficult to go to new countries when one is blind or disabled.  It is extremely difficult when one is a carer because the person for whom one is caring cannot come.  These people are trapped in Ireland.The social welfare system is supposed to do many things, including address poverty.  It is relatively successful in addressing poverty in Ireland.  Without social welfare payments, aside from pensions, 33% of people in this country would be at risk of poverty.  With the social welfare transfers, the figure is 18%, so there is some success in that regard.  However, 18% at risk of poverty is above the European average, which is 16%.  Therefore, our social welfare system still has some way to go.  We are now at a point where we are cutting it so we will not address poverty, but rather make it worse.  That is very regrettable.Consumer prices fell in the past year by 5.7%, but the Christmas bonus was cut for those on social welfare and they have to face these cuts in the budget as well.  When these two things are added together, it means that the carer's benefit has been cut by 5.6%, much more than rate of inflation when the mortgage element of that is removed.  It means the fall in real consumer prices has been far lower than 5.7% and in fact is only 2.2%.  Therefore, carers have had their benefits cut by 5.6%, which is almost 3.5% more than inflation.  Those on disability have had a cut of 6%, well above the rate of inflation.  The CSO did a survey of disability in Ireland.  Among the most commonly reported disabilities, 56% have mobility and dexterity problems and cannot move; some 47% live in pain; some 35% have problems remembering and concentrating; and 34% have psychological and mental health problems.  They cannot work and it is very difficult for them at the moment to be trapped in a situation whereby they have nowhere to go and the Government does not take their concerns into consideration when making cuts.  I know cuts are difficult, but choices can be made.Studies have been done on consistent poverty, one of which was published by the CSO earlier this year.  Consistent poverty has a number of indicators, including having no substantial meal at least one day a week over the past two weeks due to lack of money; having no heating at some stage over the past year due to lack of money; experiencing debt problems for ordinary living expenses; unable to afford two pairs of strong shoes; unable to afford a roast once a week; unable to afford a meal of chicken or fish at least every second day; and unable to afford a warm water-proof coat..The CSO found that 16% of those with disabilities in Ireland are in consistent poverty, 3.5 times more than within the average population.  These people are trapped and in taking this initiative the Government has made a very harsh choice about cutting their benefits and welfare.  This is shameful.  Obviously, the Government needed to find money, but there were many things it could have done in this regard which it did not do.  Everybody in this House has a standard of decency and it would have been in keeping with this to find the money somewhere else rather than taking it from the most vulnerable.I call on the Minister of State to remove those cuts and I support the motion before the House.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the Fine Gael motion on the subject of supports for people with disability and carers and to sum up the arguments in favour of the Government's counter-motion.I appreciate that the cuts being made in the welfare area will not be easy for people, but I believe that if the Government does not take the steps now to reduce overall public expenditure and avoid excessive borrowing, we risk making the economic situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients in the long term.  The Government has avoided making any cuts in the State pension.  We have also fully protected more than 420,000 children in welfare dependent and low-income families from cuts in child benefit and ensured that cuts in weekly rates for those aged under 66 are lower than the decreases in prices over the past year, so that their income has been protected in real terms.As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, highlighted last night, the improvements made in recent years have been unprecedented.  These include increases between 1997-2009 in the weekly rates of payment to people with disabilities and carers, which were more than three times greater than the rise in the cost of living in that period; greatly increased eligibility for income support payments as a result of significant easing of the means tests, with much higher income disregards; and the introduction in 2007 of the half-rate carer's allowance, which provides significant additional support for carers in receipt of social welfare payments.  The value of the respite care grant has also been increased from €254 in 1997 to €1,700 in 2009.There have been real improvements in additional supports that many people with disabilities and their carers receive, including the household benefits package of free television licence, electricity and telephone as well as free travel.  As a result of these and other improvements delivered by the Government, expenditure on the disability allowance has increased fivefold since 1997, while expenditure by the Department of Social and Family Affairs on supports for carers has increased fourteenfold in the same period.  Even with the reductions in last week's budget, the weekly rate of payment for the disability allowance and carer's allowance will still be almost 20% higher next year than in 2006.  In the context of a very difficult budget, the Government has avoided any cuts in the carer's allowance for those aged over 66.I understand that people with disabilities face particular challenges in their daily lives and that family carers have to make sacrifices in order to look after their loved ones.  Caring for someone else can be very challenging, as I know from personal experience.  Caring for another person, especially on a full-time basis, can have an enormous impact on the carer and his or her family, often meaning that employment opportunities have to be sacrificed, and the carer's health can even be affected.  I strongly believe for these reasons that such groups should be a priority for Government and I am glad that, when the resources were available, the supports to them were dramatically increased.As the Minister stated last night, however, the Government was faced with a stark choice in this budget.  The major improvements in welfare payments in recent years were made possible by increases in the amount of money the State was taking in from taxes.  This year, the tax receipts have dropped dramatically and, as a result, Ireland is borrowing €400 million weekly to pay, mainly, for welfare, health and education.  If the country does not reduce its borrowings not only will it have to pay enormous interest in the future, but we face the very real prospects of international banks not lending to us.  Our risk was to be in a far worse position next year and to have to make much harsher cuts then in welfare payments.  This was not an easy choice.  It was not a decision the Government took lightly, but it was the right thing to do.A number of Deputies also raised the issue of social welfare fraud.  It is worth repeating, however, that there is absolutely no evidence to support the contention that 10% of all welfare recipients are engaged in fraud.  In fact, the level of fraud is generally very low.  Nonetheless, every euro of welfare expenditure that is fraudulently claimed is one euro too many.  There are more than 600 staff working in areas related to the control of fraud and abuse of the welfare system.  More than 600,000 individual claims have been reviewed this year.  Controls on payments such as child benefit to EU workers have been tightened up this year, and the Social Welfare Bill passed by this House last week included extra powers to tackle welfare fraud.  Welfare fraud is theft, which is a serious crime.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is doing everything it can to crack down on people who abuse the system.The reduction in weekly payment rates in this budget is necessitated by the dramatic drop in tax revenue this year.  They are difficult, but unfortunately they are necessary.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	582	I also welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Denis Naughten, for bringing the motion before the House.  The motion is simple and straightforward.  We want a complete reversal of these cruel cutbacks, which will hit the blind, the disabled and carers.  In last week's budget, the Government made a huge mistake with these cuts.  History will clearly prove that.  It was unprecedented, unjust and short-sighted of the Government to hit the most vulnerable in society.  One must considers all the money that has been in this country in the past 12 years.  Not so long ago we were told the country was awash with money, and for this to happen is beyond comprehension.The Minister said that stark choices had to be made concerning the various budgetary options, but only €108 million needed to be saved to ensure these payments continued.  Better choices could have been made including cutting the number of Government quangos that exist.  In addition, administration in Departments could also have been cut, as our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, said this morning.  There were real choices and an opportunity to save this money in other ways.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has failed the people by deciding to make these miserable cuts.It is a shame that not enough has been done to deal with social welfare fraud.  The Minister of State said it was not as much as 10% of the welfare budget, but there is a clear perception that at least one in every ten people is defrauding the taxpayer.  That must be tackled seriously by the Minister and the Government.  The Minister revised her annual fraud target, reducing it by €82 million for next year.  That is shameful considering that she is not currently reaching the target.  It is a cover-up and an opportunity for the Minister not to be held accountable for how bad things are.The work that carers do has been undermined and is not appreciated by the Government, which has reduced their payments by €8.80 per week.  It rubs salt in the wounds of carers following the shelving of the national carers' strategy earlier this year.  Without carers the State would be in complete chaos.  If those being cared for at home were to be taken into State care, it would be a disaster because the Government could not cope.  Much has to be done in this regard and the work of carers must be appreciated.  Fine Gael recognises the work that carers undertake and if we were in Government we would not make such a cruel cutback.  We would make up the savings in other ways.  It is estimated that a full-time carer saves the State up to €40,000 a year, but the real figure is a lot more because one must include the social benefits involved.  In addition, the care and attention that is given by family members to their loved ones is much better than a nurse could ever provide. That is because a nurse is not related and does not know the patient personally.The 4.1% cut in blind pensions is also cruel.  Blind people have a lot more expenses as they must adapt their homes and their heating costs are higher.  It is a very low blow to go ahead with such a cutback.  The Social Welfare Bill was guillotined last week to stifle the debate and to try to bury all this information.  We are not lying down, we are standing up for the most vulnerable people in society.  We are asking all TDs to vote according to their conscience and do the right thing for the sake of those who are being cruelly discriminated against.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I support the motion, which was tabled by Deputy Naughten on behalf of Fine Gael.  We have had an interesting day in the House.  This debate is not simply about the issues which are the subject of the motion.  It also concerns our value system, how we perceive what political parties should do in Government, how they perceive society, what role political parties should play and what obligations we have to the most vulnerable people.  The motion wants to reverse cuts for carers, the disabled and the blind, which the social welfare budget seeks to implement.  It is a straightforward and simple motion that I would have hoped had the support of all sides of the House.  There is a fatal flaw in the Government parties, however.  In Government from 2002 to 2007, Fianna Fáil laid the foundation for an economic and financial disaster, the nature of which we have not seen in the history of the State.  They are now joined at the hip by the Green Party, which managed to make a bad situation worse by sitting mesmerised in Government for two years and ignoring the economic cataclysm around them.  In each budget, both parties have gone for the easy options.Tough decisions had to be made and the Fine Gael front bench spent many weeks working out the detail of an alternative budget.  We did so for two reasons.  We wanted to set out clearly that there is an alternative that does not involve attacking the most vulnerable people who are dependent on social welfare, or those on low pay.  We also did it because we had no confidence in the capacity of this Government to make the right choices.  We published our budgetary proposals a number of days in advance of the budget in the vague hope that the Government might implement some of them.  In bringing about the cuts necessary to try to move at least one step in the direction of correcting the budget deficit and our borrowing requirements, we sought to make the right choices.  In doing so, we chose a number of things.  On social welfare, for example we said there would be no cut in pensions.  That we said there would be no cut in the old-age pension is probably what influenced the Government not to make such a cut.  Last year, the Government targeted the elderly with regard to medical cards.  If it can be put this way without any disrespect, the grey voters came out and barricaded this House.  They protested loudly and the Government was forced to change course.  The Government was terrified it would find itself in the same position again, so it backed off.  It then looked at who would be the least likely to give trouble if their benefits were cut, so who was targeted?  It was the blind who, given their difficulties, would not lay siege to this House, the carers — many of whom are lucky to get a week's respite per year from what is essentially a 24-hour, seven-day a week job — who certainly did not have the time to mount a protest, and the disabled.  A government could not have more callously chosen and targeted the most vulnerable group within our community to effect cutbacks.  The Government displayed its values when it did that.  It displayed bad values and made bad choices.  In making those choices, it was protecting bankers.I said today has been an interesting day.  It is a day when the Government has rammed through the House legislation that attacks the pay of those in the public service who earn €30,000 or less.  Many of them will find themselves caught in a poverty trap.  They earn below the average minimum wage.  At the same time as making these cuts, the Government is protecting bankers.  Not one employee in Anglo Irish Bank, a nationalised bank that has brought the country to its knees, is impacted detrimentally by any measure introduced in the budget.  The Government is bankrupt of ideas, values and morality.  I believe it no longer has the authority to govern.The best that could happen would be for the Government to leave the House, ask the President to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election, but it does not have the courage to do that.  I challenge the Government to present the value system it seeks to implement in this ill-conceived legislation to the electorate.  If it does, I guarantee that after the election has taken place, the Government will find itself on this side of the House, with far fewer Deputies than it has currently.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I thank all of those who contributed to this debate.  I listened with interest last night to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  She tried to defend the cuts being made against the most vulnerable in society on the basis of increases they got in the past.  As Deputy Stanton asked earlier, does that suggest the increases they received in the past were unjust or undeserved?  I do not think so.In recent years the cost of living here has increased significantly, mainly due to the gross incompetence of the Government.  As highlighted here last night, many people who receive social welfare payments had to borrow to improve their quality of life.  All we need do to realise the seriousness of the situation is read the heart-wrenching story in yesterday's newspaper of the couple in Waterford who borrowed to be able to move into a house specially adapted for their disabled son.  The bank is now foreclosing on them.  People on the breadline are struggling to cope with a high level of debt because of the gross incompetence of the Government to manage the economy.  What use is there in telling the people that deflation is running at2.8%, but that the Government will cut their payments by 6% to ensure they really feel the pain of recession?  Why is the Government taking €108 million from carers, the blind and people with disabilities when, at the same time, it is deciding, behind closed doors, to give 55 times that amount to Anglo Irish Bank to bail it out of a further mess it has created?  The Government is planning to give €6 billion to Anglo Irish Bank next year, but it cannot find €108 million for the most vulnerable in society.Many alternatives could have been put forward by the Government to raise the €108 million, rather than take it from the vulnerable.  Member after Member who spoke this week and last lied in saying there were no choices.  There are choices that could have been made to make the €4 billion of savings.  We all agreed savings had to be made.  There were plenty of choices and these were outlined by my colleagues.  Instead of planning for 75,000 job losses next year to make a saving of almost €700 million, the Government could have accepted the Fine Gael proposal that would have created 50,000 jobs next year.  It could have got rid of 150 quangos that have on their boards the friends of Fianna Fáil but, no, it would not do that or interfere with those agencies.  It could also have stopped the ongoing and continual waste of public moneys that has gone on over the past 12 years, including the proposed frog census.  Is it right that we are spending money to count frogs, but cannot support carers, the disabled and the blind?I could mention the waste in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Some €4,000 a minute is leaving the country and being squandered through fraud.  At the same time, the Minister failed to deliver on the target she set in April with regard to fraud.  On 8 April this year, she stated here that her first priority was to tackle fraud with regard to jobseekers.  However, she is €112 million short of her target in that regard.  Strange as it may seem, only €4 million is needed to support the most vulnerable groups in our community through protecting the carers and those they care for, people with disabilities and the blind.I remind Government backbenchers that the Taoiseach said recently that budgets are not simply about balancing the books, but that is the attitude being taken by the Government currently.  He said budgets are also about acknowledging what we see as important in society.  The Government backbenchers have a choice to make tonight.  They can decide what is important for society.  Do they believe the elderly, carers, people with disabilities and the blind are important or do they believe the bankers and their friends are the people who should be bailed out and that they are the people who are important?  Those backbenchers have a choice to make, whether they want to support the vulnerable or the people who have created the mess we are in currently.  Let them decide.  Let them go up the steps and decide whether to go left or right, whether to choose Tá or Níl and whether to support the vulnerable and people who work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year long, to help the most vulnerable — people who are sick or disabled who will never have that choice.I commend the motion to the House.

Accordingly, in the 2010 budget the Government decided, as part of its strategy to manage its way through the current severe economic crisis and to return the country to prosperity, to reduce spending on public services by almost €1 billion in 2010 compared with the pre-budget estimates.  To the greatest extent possible, the savings have been sought through efficiencies rather than through reductions in services.In the case of my Department, gross funding at €415.426 million in 2010 is a reduction of 13% relative to the 2009 allocation of €475.701 million.  Current funding is reduced by 9%, a decrease of €32.1 million, and capital funding is reduced by 21%, a decrease of €28.175 million.In a joint statement with the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy John Curran, on budget day, we stressed that our primary concern is to make every effort to ensure the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.  Every saving that can be made from cutting down on overheads will be pursued so that the entire range of rural and Gaeltacht communities we serve, as well as urban and island communities, retain, to the greatest extent possible, the services that have been developed in partnership with them over the years.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	588	The Minister lost the battle in the Cabinet.  No doubt the cutbacks were savage.  Community development funding is down €22.4 million, drugs funding is down €4.4 million, Gaeltacht and islands funding is down €23.4 million, and promotion of the Irish language funding is down €2.8 million.I received many representations from the community development programmes, CDPs, in particular.  The Minister is amalgamating some of them and getting rid of others.  The timeframe is what is really worrying them.  Some of them accept there must be changes and some of them want to work with the Department.  First, they get a letter stating this will not be dealt with until March next; they then get a letter stating it must be done by December.  I ask the Minister and his junior Minister to postpone any decisions on these CDPs and to sit down, talk to them, see if they can come to an arrangement.  These are very important, both for city and rural areas.Gaeltacht and islands funding is down €23.4 million.  That would be a massive cutback in any Department.  Can the Minister operate within his Department with such cuts?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Deputy Ring raised two questions.  No doubt there are questions on the Order Paper for my Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  However, 29 CDPs have received notice that the intention is not to continue with funding.  They have been told why and they have an opportunity to appeal, which can be lodged any day up to 15 January next and which will be heard by an appeals board or group set up within the Department but which is separate from those who made the original decision.  The view of those who assessed these CDPs is that they were not effective and, therefore, there was no point in continuing to fund them.On the wider re-organisation, Deputy Ring has complained bitterly time and again about too many different bodies doing the same thing.  What we are doing is streamlining it into one clear social inclusion programme.  No doubt when the Deputy sees this work through, he will fully support it, as he has always supported rationalisation of that kind.On the Gaeltacht and islands spend, it is true that there is a decrease in the funding but a large part of that decrease, approximately €12 million, relates to a decrease in island capital funding from the high level of €23 million.  That is quite easily explained by the fact that the largest ever single infrastructure project on the Aran Islands will complete during next year.  In addition, major infrastructure such as the airstrips on Inisbofin and in Cleggan are largely complete.  There is some work outstanding, but the heavy infrastructure work is coming to completion.  It was always planned that the funding would wind down once we had got over that peak of doing so many projects together.There are still a number of projects that need to be done.  We are still planning them.  In particular, there is a pier upgrade needed on Inis Oirr, which will not be as expensive a job as those on the other two islands, and planning is going ahead.  There is a pier in Rannach in Donegal for which planning is still going ahead.  However, the kind of spend there has been in the past two years on the islands was never projected into the future and that is a large slice of the reduction in the Gaeltacht spend.I would admit that the Gaeltacht spend is tight but, for example, there were recommendations that the Irish colleges were to close and I have funding for the Irish colleges next year.  The main programmes will run even though there may be cutbacks here and there in the operational programmes.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	590	On community development, I agree I have stated on many occasions I want to see the duplication stopped and I certainly would support the Minister on that.  What I am saying is the Minister needs to talk to these community groups.  He cannot just write to them stating this is what the Department is doing.  He needs to talk to them, he needs to sit down with them.   On the appeals mechanism, he must give them an opportunity to make their case and fight their corner, and then make the decisions.  However, what is happening is they are getting letters one day stating it must be done before March and then they are told it must be done before Christmas.  At least there is an appeals mechanism.These CDPs are doing extremely good work and the Minister must sit down and talk with them.  The other day the joint committee was trying to bring the Minister in again to stall the process and give them an opportunity to make their case.  I agree that some of these groups must be amalgamated.  They themselves know and are ready for change, but they need a little time.What is the financial allocation for community supports for older persons for 2010?  Is it the same as that for last year, or has it been increased?  What is the up-to-date position?  I am worried about that important scheme.  We must ensure the funding is in place for that scheme to protect the elderly in their homes.  That scheme has worked.  The Minister opened up that scheme and closed it down again.  Will that scheme be in place for 2010?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	591	On CSOP, we have not finalised the exact allocation but the scheme will operate again next year.  As Deputy Ring will be aware, the review is nearly complete and the scheme is open at present.On the query on the CDPs, if I learned one lesson in the re-organisation of the Leader partnership companies, it was that drawing out these matters does not solve anything.  Therefore, it is important to set finite dates.There are two issues here.  There is a small number, approximately 30 out of 180 CPDs, which are recommended for closure.  There is a clear process in place.  They have been told why, they get a date to appeal, the appeal will be assessed and that will finish that process.  There is no point in dragging it out because a decision must be made.  However, they are very much the minority.  The rest of the CDPs will retain approximately the same funding next year as they had this year.The third issue is the new overarching programme so that where there are CDPs and a partnership company operating in the same area, there is a coherent approach.  The Minister of State has stated that the modalities of that will be worked out over the coming year but the decision on principle has been made and will be implemented.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	592	As I outlined previously to the Dáil and Seanad, my Department has seen the need to redesign its community development and social inclusion programmes, particularly the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and the community development programme, CDP, drawing on best international practice, and to support their ongoing evaluation.  The LDSIP and the CDP are my Department's two main social inclusion and community development programmes.  They both have a community development element and are delivered through separate local delivery structures.  These programmes come to an end on 31 December 2009 and will be superseded by a new integrated programme, the local and community development programme.The centre for effective services recently presented the outline of the new programme to me, which I accepted.  The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between the Government, its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDPs, community development programmes, and LDSIPs, local development social inclusion programmes, but will ensure a greater focus on outputs and outcomes and their evaluation.The new integrated programme is a major step forward and I am especially pleased that, notwithstanding severe budgetary constraints, the case made for the programme was accepted in determining allocations and that it was possible to secure significant funding for it for 2010.  In that context, I am pleased to say that I have been able to ring-fence funding for continuing CDPs and to maintain funding for these at 2009 levels.We have taken care in the design of the implementation process for the new programme and allowed enough time to ensure the objective of integrated service delivery can be achieved.  Once CDPs sign up to the new programme, the first tranche of 2010 funding will be provided.  This allows for service continuity from day one.  The existing CDP management structure, through the voluntary boards, will remain in place for 2010 and CDPs have been so informed, in writing.As part of the implementation process, the key stakeholders will be asked to work together at local level from early next year to develop proposals for how the programme is to be delivered during 2010.  My Department and Pobal will provide a range of supports to ensure the process is successful.  At the same time, all stakeholders will be working together to put in place a plan to ensure integrated service delivery and structures for the period after 2010.  My Department and Pobal will also be supporting that process and working with all key stakeholders.We have set out a model for integrated service delivery and structures at a local level which would involve, among other things, the re-constitution of the voluntary boards from the end of 2010.  The directors would continue to have a key role in that model.  However, we have stated repeatedly that it is up to the CDPs and the local development companies to bring forward other models, if they have something better to offer.  I have met CDPs, their networks and representatives throughout the country during the past year or more, as have my officials.  We have made it clear that we will meet anyone who is prepared to work with us in a constructive way to ensure that the new programme is delivered to the benefit of the communities we all serve.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	593	The statement from the Minister of State does not reflect what I have heard.  The community platform has sought a delay in this process but I believe the Minister is bullying communities into submission.  Such actions are a rebuff to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which sent a letter by unanimous decision.  That letter was not acted upon by the Minister.  Often, there is discussion on community involvement and activities.  Some boards have been called upon to sign up to integration with development companies of which they are not even aware.  They have been informed that they will be notified at a later stage of the details of the relevant local development company.  This is a disgrace, given the commitment that the boards of management have displayed in respect of the communities.  Many boards of management initiated the community groups but they are now informed that they are surplus to requirements and that they will be put to one side.I refer to the appeals mechanism.  Any appeal mechanism involved in this area should be independent of the Department, as should any process to provide for natural justice.  This is no reflection on the people in the Department but no one could seriously suggest there should be an appeals mechanism put in place constituted of members of the Minister's Department to consider its decisions?  It does not stand up.  Immediately there is a doubt raised by anyone who makes a case using such a mechanism.  The 30 CDPs would be under considerable pressure and the first thing they would suggest is that they have no hope because the appeals mechanism has no independent identity.  Even if the chairman of the appeals board were from outside the Department I could accept it.  However, I cannot accept it because the appeals board is made up of three people from within the Department derived from whatever section.We are all keen for this to work.  The Minister of State will be aware better than most people that we have supported this measure in every shape and form, despite the financial implications and so on.  I call on the Minister of State to bring everyone with us, to re-examine the boards of management and the appeals mechanism and not to insist that CDPs sign up to an unknown local development company to which they have no links to date.  These are three measures which can be done to move this project forward.

I refer to the appeals mechanism.  The staff involved in the appeals are from completely different sections and have not hand, act or part in——
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	595	It in no way reflects on——
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I make this point specifically.  While any appeal need not be submitted until the middle of January, the CDPs unsuccessful in the review were not only informed that they were unsuccessful, but they were informed of the reasons.  This will subsequently assist them during any appeal.  We have also made a commitment to these CDPs to help them with finance and funding during the course of their appeal, such that their funding would not come to an end at the end of the current year.  I make the point that we are now in a different situation financially.  Previously, when we cut funding to CDPs one comment they all made was that if they were subjected to another cut, they would be out of business.  The idea of having a radical examination and implementing a new, single programme is to ensure we address the concerns highlighted in the McCarthy report and elsewhere such that we produce tangible and measurable outcomes, clear programmes, that we avoid duplication and to avoid excessive bureaucracy.  There are in excess of 230 different legal entities delivering community development in the country along with all the associated burdens of administration and compliance with company law.  The focus must be on addressing the issues of key concern to disadvantaged people in our communities.Deputy Wall is correct to raise this matter and it is a shame there are CDPs in the country which operate in a way such that they are oblivious to and unaware of what other partnership and local development companies are doing.  I do not blame the CDPs and this is why I seek a single, integrated programme and the reason the Government has made this commitment.I refer to the request to meet individual CDPs.  I have given adequate time to tease out all the detail.  Implementation will take place over the course of one year and this has been clearly spelt out.  I refer to the community platform.  My officials and I have made it clear that we are quite prepared to meet any group.  I will stand corrected but to the best of my knowledge I have not received a request to meet the community platform.  However, I am available to meet to address this matter in the coming year.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I did not seek to cast aspersions on the people the Minister of State selects for appeals.  However, from years of experience in various societies and associations with which I have been involved, I am aware that the one thing such a process must have is an independent voice for any appeals mechanism.  I state again that the one thing that must be done is to appoint a person independent from the Department.  We are all aware this is possible and that there are many people throughout the country with expertise in community development at their fingertips.  I call for such an appointment because it would help to resolve the difficulties.  As long as the current set-up exists, some doubt will remain and I do not care what case the Minister of State makes, if there are three officials appointed from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to hear an appeal, the rug could be pulled from underneath them immediately.  I call on the Minister to consider my suggestion.I understand the Minister of State will appear before the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs again in respect of this matter.  I thank the Minister of State for his commitment to meet the community platform.  If we are to progress this matter there is a need for such meetings.  Everyone seeks to progress the matter and I will continue to argue until the matter winds up that the boards of management and those who created the initiative in many cases are being sidelined to the detriment of local communities.  This will continue to be the case if the Minister of State does not change his position, which is a major error and mistake and amounts to a rebuff of their efforts.  I call on the Minister of State to meet the community workers co-operative sooner rather than later to address their concerns.  I also call on him to do something regarding the appeals mechanism.  It would not be an excessively substantial measure but it would help the Minister of State to bring everyone on-side and he would certainly have me on-side with respect to the appeal mechanism if he responds to the request I have made.

Both I and my officials, at different times and in different ways, do this.To clarify one point, I did not select the staff within the Department who were to make the appeals.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The Minister of State is missing the point.

It was not a question of the Minister coming in and saying, "You, you and you".  It was senior management within the Department.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I strongly support the participation of recovering drug users on community employment schemes as part of the rehabilitation process.  I am aware of the importance of such schemes in the recovery paths of many and I wish to acknowledge the role played by FÁS in that regard.  Recovering drug users participate, for the most part, in special drugs-related CE projects, though some participate in mainstream CE schemes.  The adjustments made for special drugs-related CE projects aim to facilitate the rehabilitation process.The report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, which was chaired by my Department and which reported in 2007, recognised the contribution made by CE and made a number of recommendations for improvement.  These included a greater focus on the health and education requirements of participants, the expansion of the number of available places from 1,000 to 1,300 and greater inter-agency co-ordination to meet the overall needs of the participants.Progress on these areas is being addressed through the national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee, NDRIC, chaired by the HSE and on which FÁS is represented.  At the same time, FÁS has re-convened a CE working group on drugs-related projects, involving representatives of the various sectors who are working towards improving the overall outcomes for participants by having a sharper focus on inter-agency working, access to schemes, training and development opportunities, supervision ratios and opportunities for onward progression.Special drugs-related CE projects are, of course, only one part of the rehabilitation effort.  Effective delivery of rehabilitation requires an overall inter-agency approach based on a continuum of care that operates within the context of enhanced case management and a quality standards framework.  It also involves addressing the broad needs of individuals, across medical support, training and employment, education, housing, prison-related issues and family-related issues.  This broad approach is being encouraged through the work of the NDRIC, which has representatives of all relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the voluntary and community sectors.  I have also established a residential rehabilitation group, chaired by my Department, to better co-ordinate the integration of the provision of residential rehabilitation services across the sectors.Under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, I will meet twice a year with a number of Ministers and various senior officials who are involved in implementing various key actions in the strategy.  As part of my emphasis on rehabilitation, I will meet with both FÁS and the senior rehabilitation co-ordinator, who is based in the HSE, in this process.  Last week I met with the director general of FÁS and had a very worthwhile exchange, with agreement on the need to focus on outcomes.  I also met with the senior rehabilitation co-ordinator in the last few days and we discussed developments to date and approaches to expediting progress in the months ahead.  Progress on rehabilitation will also figure prominently at the quarterly meetings of the oversight forum on drugs, which I chair.  This forum will review progress across the strategy and will address any operational difficulties and blockages that arise.  I believe that the structures we now have in place will facilitate significant progress on rehabilitation over the period of the strategy.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am pleased that his heart is in the right place on this issue.I bring the Minister of State back some months to when he visited the Liberty Recycling place in Bluebell, Ballyfermot.  He gave a speech and commented on how important the service was, especially for people going through addiction who were trying to get their lives back onto some kind of path.  There is hope for them.Last Monday after the "Would You Believe" programme which featured Liberty Recyling, I visited the place again.  The President of Ireland came to see the operation and the 50 people working there, all of them on CE schemes.  What came across from the President's speech was how important it is for all of us as a community to ensure that people who really want to get their lives back together are supported as much as possible.  I know the Minister of State is fully supportive of this.The difficulty about these projects is that they are very short-term.  For the number of years Liberty Recycling has been going, since 1999, everybody who has come in on a CE scheme has been short-term only, working for three years.  There might be the odd 55 year old who is able to stay for four years.  What happens then is that the person is thrown back into the wilderness where it is very difficult for him or her to find a job, especially at this time.  At the time of the "Would You Believe" programme, a girl worked in the office who had to leave because her time was up.  The Minister of State probably saw her.  I felt very angry because she had a real opportunity to stay there for another while, participating in that project, perhaps coming out in two years' time, in better condition than the way she is leaving now, and with more hope.  She is going out now into a workforce where very many people are seeking work.The Minister of State said he supports these schemes.  Will he and his Government support them by trying to put in place a longer term for community employment schemes, especially for people in projects like this one?  It is very important for them.  As the Minister of State said, it is about education and health but is also about companionship and being part of a small community, namely, the CE workforce.  It is when they are sent out into the bigger, wilder world that such people can fall down.I ask the Minister of State, through his Government, to consider giving these people a longer work time and help them stay within these projects, fulfilling what they want to do, going out into the world eventually to take on their role again and be part of society.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I thank the Deputy for her contribution.  I believe these particular CE schemes are crucially important, both for the individuals and their families but also for people who have a drug addiction because they are given hope for the future.  I recently met Mr. Paul O'Toole, the director general of FÁS, to discuss this.  A point the Deputy might not realise is that there are 1,000 ring-fenced places but until recently only 700 to 800 people were taking them up.  We were not able to get the 1,000 people.  That is a piece of work but we have improved.  Since I became aware of these factors we have worked hard.  Those who go onto these types of courses, who come from a background of addiction, need a degree of pre-preparation before they can go onto the CE schemes.  I asked FÁS specifically to start looking at and monitoring the individuals who come in.  Some drop out at early stages so there are a number of issues.The schemes have huge potential.  Deputy Byrne asked specifically whether those who had completed three years could be retained longer.  From an ideological point of view I do not have a hang-up about that but have one concern.  In itself, community employment is not the answer.  It is a stepping stone and I do not want the focus to be taken away from that.In my reply I mentioned the continuum of care.  It is greatly important that a person should have a degree of preparation before going onto a CE scheme.  The time spent in CE does not mean only doing that particular job but is a preparation for progression.  One of the problems I constantly encounter dealing with drug-related issues is that sometimes we do not look at progression.  We think providing more of the same is sufficient but it is not.  We need to have higher expectations and goals by which we can move people along successfully and incrementally.  The steps may be small but step by step they will move along.In that regard, I view the weakness not as the three-year period but that we need to have clearer paths so that when a person completes the three years on CE there will be somewhere to go.  I also emphasised that the period prior to going on to a scheme is equally crucial because I am aware some people enter CE schemes and do not last long on them.  That is due to being ill-prepared and so forth.  At both ends of the three-year period there is a piece of work to be done which falls into the category of continuum of care.  I view CE schemes as being crucial for real rehabilitation for former drug users.

We do not want to see people's work being prolonged on a CE scheme.  However, these are very different people.  They have a real need and hunger to be part of a community and sending them back in to communities where there is no work is not good.  Even if it were only a matter of extending those schemes for a further five years we could give people a proper chance to get back where they should be.  We send them out into a workforce where thousands of people are unemployed, including people leaving college with degrees.  What hope have these people got if they are sent away from a three-year scheme?

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 30 together.I am satisfied that the objectives of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 will be achieved despite the cuts in funding for 2010.  When the strategy was launched in September last, it was clear that its implementation would have to be achieved in the context of more limited funding in the short to medium term.  At that time I identified the optimum use of the available resources as being essential, with a strong focus on the further development of interagency work.  This approach will facilitate the delivery of more efficient and effective services, leading to improved outcomes for people who are affected by the drugs problem.As part of the implementation process, I met all drugs task forces over the past few months and the expected position in regard to funding for 2010 was among the issues discussed in all cases.  I emphasised the need to prioritise projects with a view to ensuring the most effective use of resources and the most beneficial outcomes for service users.  Needs and priorities change over time and, consequently, drugs task forces and service providers must ensure that funding is realigned to match changing circumstances.  The task forces are fully engaged in this process and I have given them the scope to redirect funding within their allocations to best address the realigned priorities they identified for their areas of operation.  I am satisfied this approach will minimise the impact from the reduction in funding in 2010.As part of the strategy, I intend twice a year to meet a number of Ministers and various senior officials who are tasked with implementing various actions in the strategy.  I have completed the first round of such meetings and have stressed the need for Departments and agencies to ensure that high priority is given to achieving the objectives of the strategy.  These meetings facilitated a good exchange of views and focused on the importance of the continued effective implementation of other programmes that affect the broader issues underpinning problem drug use.Members should also note that a drugs advisory group has been set up under the new strategy, with membership from across the statutory, community and voluntary sectors.  This group meets regularly, advises me on operational and policy matters relating to the national drugs strategy and oversees and supports the work of the drugs task forces.  An oversight forum on drugs, OFD, which I chair, has been also established and the first meeting was held in October.  The primary role of the oversight forum is the ongoing high level examination of progress across the strategy and addressing of any operational difficulties and blockages that may arise.  Against this background, I have asked for progress reports by later this month from all Department and agencies that have lead responsibility for actions of the strategy.  The reports will cover the status of progress on the actions and the plans and time scale for full implementation.  The outcome of this process will feed into the next meeting of the forum in January and robust performance management will continue throughout the implementation period of the strategy.While there will be some reduction in the resources available in 2010, the overall amount of money available to tackle the drugs problem will still be considerable.  I remind Deputies that more than €275 million was made available to tackle the drugs problem across Departments and agencies in 2009 and considerable progress is being made.  At the same time, the difficulties facing our society as a consequence of problem drug use are significant, and addressing all the factors involved will not be easy.  However, I am determined that real progress will continue to be made across the period of the strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way to achieve implementation of the agreed actions.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	627	Is the Minister of State saying that in the past too much money was spent on these programmes or that the money spent was not used efficiently or effectively?  He now seems to be able to make do with less money.  Has there ever been an analysis of the cost of the illegal drug trade to the State, in terms of policing, crime, education and health?  Is the illegal drug trade in the State increasing or decreasing?  Will he comment on heroin misuse?  It is reported it is becoming a significant problem, especially in rural areas across the country.  How will cutting back on funding impact on the fight against the heroin problem and drug misuse generally in the State?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	628	We had a charade regarding the national drugs strategy a few weeks ago.  I was there, as was the Taoiseach and the Minister.  Were we codding those involved in trying to do something for those affected by drugs?  At that stage the Government was deciding on the Estimates.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, knew exactly what was happening regarding the cut backs.  Deputy Stanton has asked the questions I wanted to ask.  What projects will be cut?  What areas of the country will be affected?  Will anything be delivered, other than the new strategy in 2010?  I spoke to Deputy Byrne earlier.  She is somebody who has represented her area very well and had a great understanding——

If you stopped interrupting me I would be finished.  Was it a farce to announce the national drugs strategy when the money is not in place?  Deputy Byrne has done a great deal of work regarding people affected by drugs and because they are not powerful enough to come and lobby outside the House, it was easy to cut their funding.  I will address the comment on Deputy Mitchell in a moment.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	656	One aspect of the strategy about which I am concerned in a broader context is local drugs taskforces and their presence on the ground, in terms of the public relations exercise which should happen.  How are they linking with all the community activities and schools?  How are they talking to the local newspapers and radio stations?  I do not believe that is happening.  I am deeply concerned that the confidence needed to fight this awful habit which is now a problem in many urban and rural communities.  How can we gel the whole system together to give confidence to parents and so on?
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Ten seconds, Deputy.

#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The Minister said there is a difficult time ahead for everybody, given the funding situation.  I have a question regarding the cut of 11% in the drugs initiative programme.  This morning, a spokesperson for Ballyfermot youth centre spoke on a radio programme about the project it runs for young children, in particular teenagers in school.  It is a six-week programme called Can You Hack It which deals with addiction to cocaine, hash, alcohol and other drugs.  Next year it will have to close the project because its funding through the drugs initiative has been cut.  If there was ever a time when we needed to educate young people here about drugs it is now.I ask the Minister to speak to the people in Ballyfermot youth club and see if there is any way this project, which has done wonders for young people in the area in terms of keeping them out of a problem which is rife throughout communities, can be kept in place.  The problem will be solved through education, not through other measures.  If we are to stop the scourge of drugs in this country, we have to start by educating young people.  It does not need to be done through schools; it can be done in communities in the way it is being done here, which is the correct way to go.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	660	What will the Minister do about the Ministers or Departments which are withdrawing their commitment to the strategy?  His Department co-ordinates the strategy.  I refer specifically to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O'Keeffe.  Can the Minister knock heads together and get all the Ministers together who were part of the strategy when the Taoiseach launched it some weeks ago?  I do not know what the structures are — the Cabinet sub-committee or the IDG may deal with this area.  It must be very embarrassing that some of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues are walking away from the strategy.  Over the year this money was moved from his Department to the Department of Education and Science.  It was included in the education ELS.  Will the Minister meet the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, get the money back for his Department and run the projects?Deputy Byrne referred to Ballyfermot.  There are a number of educational projects in my area of Finglas and Ballymun.  We could understand a cut of 10% or 11% because that is the world in which we now live.  Projects will have to live with that.  Ministers are announcing they are withdrawing their commitment with regard to money which was transferred from their Departments several years ago.  I ask the Minister to get that money back and run the projects himself.  He is responsible for them and his Department is the co-ordinator for the strategy.  Ministers cannot be allowed to carry on like that.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	669	To answer the last question on funding from other Departments for the drugs strategy, I understand the project to which Deputy Byrne referred is one which was funded by the Department of Education and Science.  I will answer the question in that context, but if it is not I will revert to the Deputy after the debate.  Our drug advisory group met today.  Unfortunately I could not attend the meeting because the business of the House was voted upon.  One issue which arose concerned the Department of Education and in that context I will meet the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O'Keeffe.This aspect related to projects that were mainstreamed and originally funded from another Department.  I can confirm that projects that are mainstreamed to the HSE while there will be a percentage cut, it is in the order of 5% or 7% and not of the same scale.  So those projects may experience some difficulty, but not a withdrawal of funding as has been indicated in this case with the Department of Education and Science.  I will meet the Minister for Education and Science to ascertain the rationale and what can be done to address it.Deputy Stanton asked about the analysis of costs.  Figures for the total package of costs do not seem to exist in the global sense that he requested.  He also asked how we would do things better and whether the entire strategy was a farce.  It is not a farce, far from it.  Considerable work went into developing the strategy.  Let me make this point forcefully.  It is not my strategy, but the strategy of the people involved in the area.  Considerable consultation went into it and it runs for an extended period.  While incrementally in any given year we might not achieve as much as we want, if we do not have a sense of direction as to where we are going, we are at nothing.  The strategy clearly sets out a direction.  My job as Minister of State with responsibility for the strategy is to try to progress it year on year, but it is not based on any one year.  I met representatives of all the task forces earlier in the year and indicated to them that inevitably there would be some level of reduction in funding.  While the headline reduction figure across the area is 11%, the reduction in the level of funding to the local task forces is in the order of 8.5% and the regional task forces, on which we spent €10 million in 2009, will receive €10 million again this year.  The reason for this is the level service provided by the regional task forces would not have developed as much.I agree with Deputy Stanton that heroin use has increased throughout the country.  The anecdotal evidence and a number of recent surveys have shown that.  It emerged out of Dublin, extended down the east coast and throughout Leinster and is now around the southern part of the country.  While it is also a problem in other parts of the country, those would be the parts where it is most prevalent.  We would have had the anecdotal evidence of that from people presenting for treatment, etc., and we have dealt with it.  We have worked with the HSE to have new clinical capacity available in Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Cork, Tralee and Limerick all operational in the first quarter of next year.  While clinics are of great value they are nothing without the back-up of what we call "level 2" GPs.  At the moment, unfortunately, people from some of those areas need to travel to Dublin.  The funding for that was put in place last year.  The secret of success when there is less money involves a commitment from the HSE to reorganise the way it is doing business.  It is providing clinical staff in those centres from within its existing allocation of resources.  That is how we will make progress.While the level of funding has reduced, so has our cost of living.  I spoke to representatives of task forces and asked them to carefully consider efficiencies.  They need to review their rents, overheads and use of manpower.  Those who are employed as counsellors need to be used for counselling services and facilities need to be shared, etc.  That is what each task force has undertaken to do.  While people may disagree, yesterday when the Taoiseach was asked a question he indicated that our cost of living had dropped back to what it was in February 2007.  In February 2007 the funding we made available to task forces was less than €28 million.  The funding we are allocating to task forces this year, while less than last year is considerably more than it was in 2007 and is in the region of €31 million.  While I am not taking away from the difficulties it will pose for task forces to live within that, if we reorganise and co-ordinate better and seek efficiencies, particularly in the areas of administration and overheads, I believe that we should be able to deliver again this coming year all of the front-line services we delivered in 2009.

When does the Minister expect to make a final decision on decentralisation?  Will it ever happen?  Is the OPW planning to delay indefinitely?  Regardless of the OPW decision, does the Minister have a preferred site?  What is the up-to-date position on Kiltimagh and Charlestown?  Is the Minister concerned the move will proceed?  Are the finances in place?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	693	As the Deputy knows the decision to decentralise was made and the initial proposal was to locate at Knock Airport.  The Government proceeded to acquire a site and sought planning permission which was granted by Mayo County Council.  A sole person, Mr. Sweetman, who lives here in Dublin, as he is perfectly entitled to do, objected to An Bord Pleanála and in a decision that surprised me, An Bord Pleanála overturned the granting of planning permission.  One of the reasons it gave was that there was not enough public transport.  I can never get my head around how that could be the case at an airport, but so be it.  At the time, back in 2008, the Government considered that decision and as the Deputy is aware the Government very quickly made a decision later in 2008 — I believe it was in October — to acquire a site in Charlestown.  A site has been located in Charlestown.  Following that a group from Kiltimagh proposed all sorts of buildings for us.  That delayed us for another year and on it goes.  The Deputy keeps asking me the questions and I keep saying we are looking at it.I can tell the Deputy today that unfortunately or fortunately, the alternative building in Kiltimagh was also considered by the OPW and was found to be unsuitable, so we have lost a year.  Unfortunately, I do not know what mí-ádh is on us because no sooner have we cleared the Kiltimagh proposal off the playing pitch than we have a problem in funding it in 2010 because the OPW's decentralisation capital budget has been cut back.  While I have the decision to decentralise to Charlestown and I have a site that has been acquired, owing to all the delays — mostly third-party delays — unfortunately we cannot proceed at this point.However, I encourage the Deputy to look to his colleague Deputy McGinley, who was rightly very persistent in pursuing me on the decentralisation of Foras na Gaeilge to Gaoth Dobhair.  Many times over the years I believe Deputy McGinley thought we would never get there.  However, we got the good news recently that this decentralisation is now proceeding and with much persistence and difficulty we are overcoming the problems.  No doubt we will also overcome the problems with Charlestown.  I am sure the people of Tubbercurry are delighted tonight.  There are 91 civil servants located in a building in Tubbercurry and I am told it is doing considerable good for the town.

Decentralisation is about people.  We promised that 140 staff would go to Knock Airport.  We decentralised 100 to Tubbercurry and we have 91 located there.  We promised ten staff to the Department's office in Na Forbacha and that decentralisation is complete.  We promised 40 staff of Pobail to Clifden.  We had 25 there and I believe the number is now 20.  We promised 30 staff of Foras na Gaeilge to Gaoth Dobhair.  That is a North-South body with a lot of difficulties.  There are five definites and eight possibles; depending on who gets the job, up to 13 will be going there.  We have proceeded with all elements of decentralisation promised in 2003, but what we have not got is a permanent building.

It has been finished and ready for occupation for some time, but it has not been opened.  The equipment for this hospital is being stored in the occupational therapy department of St. Finan's Hospital in Killarney.  The occupational therapy unit in Killarney is defunct; on top of that, a CCTV system has had to be provided to safeguard the equipment for this hospital.  The hospital was intended to be opened on a phased basis.  I imagine this is due to the recruitment embargo in the public service; that is the only reason I can come up with.  There is a new community hospital in Dingle that has been finished for some time and has yet to be opened.  Again, we are advised that this is to be opened on a phased basis.  There is a new building on the grounds of St. Finan's to cater for psychiatric patients, which also has been finished for some time and has yet to be opened.  Again, we are led to believe the reason for this is the recruitment embargo.To move to the psychiatric side, there was an agreement with the unions that St. Finan's would be closed in 2007, yet we are now going into 2010 and nothing has been done.  The last time I raised this issue there were 52 patients in St. Finan's psychiatric hospital, with 65 staff to look after them.  A new unit has been since built to house several of the patients, which has not yet been opened because of the recruitment embargo.  It costs €1,000 per day just to heat St. Finan's.The Sheppard report stated that if €50,000 was spent on upgrading Cherryfield House, another psychiatric facility in Killarney, it would accommodate the rest of the psychiatric patients from St. Finan's.  Yet we maintain St. Finan's, which has 52 patients and 65 staff.  In the budget, as the leader of my party stated earlier today when talking about alternative options, it was announced——

To ensure the budget was passed, the Government promised a new 42-bed hospital for Kenmare, which I hope does happen.  However, there are already three facilities in the county that have not yet been opened because of the recruitment embargo.  I ask the Minister not to pull the wool over people's eyes.  He should give them the truth about what is actually happening in the health service in Kerry.

I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.As the Deputy is aware, Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not possible, we support access to quality long-term residential care.  The Health Act 2004 provides that the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  The provision of these services, including community hospitals at local level, is therefore an operational matter for the HSE, as a statutory body.The current long-stay residential care needs for older people in the Kerry area are met by the provision of continuing care beds in community hospitals, public voluntary units and contracted beds in private registered nursing homes.  On 27 October the new nursing homes support scheme, A Fair Deal, commenced.  The scheme will equalise State support for public and private nursing home residents and ensure nursing home care is affordable for all who need it.The construction of the Tralee community nursing unit was completed in December 2008 and it is currently at the equipping stage.  This unit will provide 50 residential care places for older people in the Tralee catchment area when fully operational.  An equipping——

Despite the significant challenges imposed by the employment control framework and the associated moratorium on the recruitment of certain disciplines, the HSE is considering all options for opening the unit, including doing so on a phased basis, commencing in the first quarter of 2010.The construction phase of Dingle Community Hospital was completed in late 2008 and the hospital is currently being equipped in the same way as the Tralee community nursing unit.  The staffing requirements are currently being finalised.  Despite the challenges faced in the provision of staffing, it is envisaged that the first phase of the opening of the new hospital will take place in the first quarter of 2010.  This first phase will see the transfer of 43 residents from the current hospital to the new building.  The total capacity will be 68 when fully operational.When it was it was launched in 2006, A Vision for Change was universally welcomed as a progressive, evidence-based and realistic document which proposed a new model of service delivery that would be patient-centred, flexible and community-based.  The report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  Extensive consultation with service users, families and service providers informed this policy.  The most pressing priority voiced was the need for an accessible and user-friendly mental health service in which users can be respected as active partners in their own recovery and where they can avail of interventions to enable them remain meaningfully involved in their own communities.  The Government accepted A Vision for Change as the basis for the development of our mental health services over a seven to ten year period.  Much has happened and much has changed economically since the report was launched, but it remains a progressive document and remains our roadmap, charting the way forward for our mental health services.Mental health services are provided in many settings including acute inpatient facilities, day hospitals, day care centres, low support and high support community accommodation.  A Vision for Change recognises that acute hospitalisation will be required to meet the needs of those who require care and treatment in an inpatient setting.  However, service users, their families and carers want a range of mental health service options established in their local community so that comprehensive care can be provided.The focal point of modern mental health services is the community and the community based service.  A Vision for Change recommends a total of 50 acute beds per 300,000 population.The HSE has for the past number of years been working towards the closure of the St. Finan's mental health hospital and the provision of alternative modern state-of-the-art mental health facilities and other general primary care facilities for the population of Killarney and east Kerry.  A range of mental health facilities and community services are being proposed as a replacement of the hospital as follows: Replacement facilities for current services provided in St. Finan's Hospital — 25 place later life challenging behaviour services to accommodate the current patient complement — this unit will become a dementia specific unit for the local health office in the future when the current population declines; 15 place interim low secure facility to accommodate the current patient complement — initially this unit will operate as a rehabilitation unit for current patients located in two secure wards; ten place community residence to accommodate the remaining patient population in St. Finan's Hospital.A redesign of the existing acute psychiatric unit in Kerry General Hospital is also proposed, to provide a four bed, close observation unit in order to appropriately manage patients within the acute unit.The proposals as outlined will be funded from the proceeds of the sale of mental health lands.  The 2010 budget provided for a multi-annual programme of capital investment in high priority mental health projects consistent with A Vision for Change.  In 2010 the HSE will proceed to dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €43 million in the mental health capital programme.  Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011 Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year's programme of asset sales.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I am thankful to the Acting Chairman for allowing me to raise this serious question in the House tonight and I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív will be replying.  He had occasion to visit this housing estate with me a year ago, I believe, in Ballylynch, Carrick-on-Suir.  It is a very old housing estate, more than 30 years in existence, with a large number of houses.  The particular scheme as proposed by the Carrick-on-Suir Town Council has been actively supported by the town manager, town clerk and indeed all the local authority members.  The present mayor of the town is pushing it as hard as she can.There was much confusion and disappointment as regards this regeneration proposal.  It is only at phase 2 of what will obviously be a long-running regeneration development in different stages.  This is a wonderful community of hard working people.  The actual phase I am talking about comprises 72 houses, more than 40 of which are in private ownership.  I commend the occupants who had the vision and the courage to get their mortgages to buy those houses from the local authority, but herein lies the problem, I believe, although the Minister might say, otherwise.Several reports were sent to the Department in February this year and there was a request for amendments to the proposal in April.  A final report was made to the Department in June and nothing has been heard from it sense.  I am in touch on a constant basis with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, lobbying the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran and his officials on this issue.  Obviously, we need to know what allocation we are going to get, so that we may proceed on that basis.  A hard working committee is trying to oversee the regeneration programme on local authority houses, but it will be difficult to do if, for example, houses Nos. 2 and 3 are in private ownership, houses Nos. 4 and 5 are publicly owned and houses Nos. 6 and 7 are again private.  Regardless of that, we need to get something moving because people are losing their patience and becoming very frustrated at the length of time it is taking to get this scheme off the ground.It is a RAPID area, also, and as the Minister knows there is a new playground where he scored a goal on me during his visit.  I was not able to do much against the ferocity of that ball.  The light was fading, he took a drop kick at the goal and it was in the back of the net before I saw it.  Hopefully, he can encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran and his other colleagues to move this situation forward and try to have the funding allocated.  As I have said, this will only be the first of a number of phases.  As the old adage says, tosach maith leath na h-oibre, but the local officials need clarification as regards the status of their proposals.  We are told by the Department that it is with the Minister of State, awaiting his signature.  We need to have the project signed off, and it would be a wonderful Christmas present, in the event, to allow the people to have a good start in the new year and to sort out their issues as regards the private versus public question.  I do not mean this in any adversarial way.  It is a question of sorting out the regeneration scheme which is badly needed, so that those families can live in dignity, having put a vote of confidence in their estate.  It would be a pity when people are so well motivated as regards buying their homes that anything might stymie such a badly needed and well-designed project, which deserves to go ahead.

In fact I have visited Ballylynch twice and fully understand the desire of the Deputy that this issue of regeneration should be proceeded with.  I hope I get to visit Ballylynch a third time, when perhaps I can get a second goal against him.This Government's commitment to social housing takes a broad approach to supporting the development of sustainable communities.  A crucial element of this approach is our commitment to supporting the development of sustainable communities in existing local authority estates through various improvement and regeneration initiatives.  Regeneration, in particular, is focused on addressing the issues of social, educational and economic disadvantage experienced in some of the most challenging areas of the country.The social housing improvement works programme spans a range of Exchequer funded and local authority funded programmes and initiatives designed to maintain and improve the local authority housing stock.  Over the past number of years, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has significantly increased its investment in this area through support for estate-wide remedial works, programmes where specific deficits are to be addressed — for example, from a health and safety or energy efficiency perspective — and for an ambitious national programme of regeneration projects.  For all projects, with the exception of large regeneration projects, the Department has required a contribution from the local authority's own resources.The remedial works programme provides support for local authorities to significantly improve run-down estates by improving the layout, addressing issues of anti-social behaviour, improving the housing fabric, and where possible, addressing issues of social exclusion.  This programme has been expanding since it commenced in the 1980s and is a  critical element of the overall improvement works programme.  It is well recognised that remedial works projects are significantly more labour intensive than new construction projects, and as such also offer opportunities to stimulate local employment in some of the most disadvantaged areas of the country.In 2009, the Department has continued to support some 55 remedial work projects around the country from an allocation of €53 million.  A further €35 million of funding will be required in future years to complete these projects and will obviously have first call on the available funding.  In addition, a further 22 projects were identified for inclusion in the programme for the period 2010-12, with a total estimated cost over the three years of €50 million.  A number of these projects are now at funding approval stage and, in light of the resources available to the Minister for 2010, he is now considering the extent to which these can be supported next year.This brings me to the project raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath — the Ballylynch estate in Carrick on Suir, County Tipperary, which is one of the projects mentioned as being considered in the context of available funding for 2010.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has already supported a pilot project of ten units in the Ballylynch estate.  The next phase of the project involves both new build and remedial elements.  In general, 75% of the funding for remedial schemes is available from the Department, with 25% being provided by the local authority from its own internal capital receipts.Once again, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht an scéil seo a thógáil sa Dáil.  Tá meas ar leith agam ar an bpobal áirithe i Ballylynch.  Is ceantar RAPID é.

However, a number of farmers are still awaiting payment as no cheques have been issued since 13 November.  To many farmers this is the only income they will get before Christmas.  This year has been disastrous for the farming community.  According to CSO figures, the value of milk output fell by almost 35% or €567 million, due mainly to a decrease in prices.  For example, the price of a litre of milk in Kerry was 40 cent in 2007, but it has now fallen to about 24 cent, which is still better than other counties.  The cattle output value was also down by 10.7%.  Coming on top of the income drop of 11% in 2008, this represents the worst income crisis for the sector since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973.The collapse is due to poor commodity prices, Government cuts, the continuing weakness of sterling and the dreadful weather conditions experienced during the year.  Government cuts in vital schemes totalling €130 million have impacted severely on farm incomes.  Also, the Government carbon tax will further increase farm production costs by almost €17.5 million per year, which represents a further 1% cut in farm incomes.The Minister has signalled that €25 million per annum would be found by cutting the disadvantaged area payment scheme by an estimated 11.5% from 2010.  This is in addition to a cut of €34 million in the October 2008 budget.  This was done by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares or 84 acres.  Farmers in County Kerry were particularly affected by this cut.Due to the disastrous year for Kerry farmers and Irish farmers in general, it is vital that all outstanding payments be sent out before Christmas to help farmers to get over this expensive period.

The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is telling farmers that it does not have money to pay them.  The Minister should order these payments to be made immediately, as these people are depending on them for Christmas.  Will he make an urgent statement on the matter?  Farming seems to have been forgotten in all the debates on the budget.  Farming families have taken a 43% cut over the past two years.  Either there is money in the kitty or the Minister's staff are telling these people lies.  That word is not supposed to be used, but farmers are discouraged and upset.  They are being told there is no money in the kitty and that the payments will not be made before Christmas.  I urge the Minister to ensure that these hard pressed farm families receive what they deserve.  The Minister promised they would be paid and I want to ensure that will happen immediately.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	724	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as ucht deis a thabhairt dom freagraí a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna tábhachtacha seo.Payments under the 2009 disadvantaged areas scheme commenced on 22 September 2009.  To date, the Department has made payments worth in excess of €220 million to over 97,000 scheme beneficiaries, representing over 96% of eligible applicants.  In addition, the necessary savings required to increase the level of total payments above the original allocation of €220 million have now been identified within the Department's budget.  The necessary sanction has been obtained from the Department of Finance and I expect that additional payments in the region of €3 million will issue this week.These additional payments, which will bring total payments above the original €220 million provision, reflect the fact that payments made in any given year include those in respect of a proportion of applications carried over from previous years.In addition to payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme, payments under other schemes have continued in recent months at an unprecedented level.  For example, payments under the single payment scheme, worth almost €1.25 billion, have issued to some 123,000 farmers since 16 October.  The advance payments began a full six weeks earlier than provided for under the rules of the scheme and the level of advance payment, at 70%, is unprecedented.  This reflects the pressure brought to bear on the European Commission by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, in recognition of the difficulties being experienced by farmers with low commodity prices and poor weather during the summer months.  The advance payments at the 70% rate provided a valuable cash flow benefit for Irish farmers.The efficiency of the payment systems operated by the Department compares favourably with even the most efficient systems operated by other member states.  It is well worth recording the fact that the Department's record in issuing payments under both the disadvantaged areas scheme and the single payment scheme are second to none in the EU.We have achieved an unprecedented 99% level of payments so far and, this year in particular, the timing and level of payments have made a major contribution to farm family incomes at a difficult time.In addition to these two major schemes, which between them will result in payments worth almost €1.5 billion this year to almost 120,000 Irish farmers, I am pleased to confirm to the House that payments under the new 2009 upland sheep payment commenced this week, with in excess of €4.7 million having already issued.  In addition, payments under the emergency damaged fodder aid scheme, targeted specifically at those farmers most seriously affected by the widespread flooding, will also begin to issue this week.The Department is also continuing to make REPS payments and, following the supplementary Estimate approved by the Dáil last week, I expect that we will pay up to €369 million under REPS this year, which is one of the largest amounts ever paid in any given year.I want to assure the House that the Government and I acknowledge the value of these schemes to Irish farmers, as evidenced by the decisions taken in last week's budget to protect funding for them in 2010.  I am entirely satisfied that the level and efficiency of payments made under the various schemes by the Department in recent months has played, and will continue to play, an important role in providing a vital boost to the economic activity of rural areas.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	733	In the past ten or 12 years, we have developed the national drugs strategy, which is a co-ordinated policy across five community pillars.  It is co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, but there is also a major involvement by a number of other Departments.  These include the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, among others.  The work is done not just by the Departments themselves, but in many cases also by a number of agencies under the remit of Departments.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the co-ordinating body.  A few months ago it got the Taoiseach to launch the new strategy.  That must be fairly embarrassing for them now that the Department of Education and Science seems to be withdrawing its commitment to the strategy.  It is in that context that I am raising this matter this evening.Since the local drugs task forces were established over ten years ago, the system has been that different types of projects are developed locally in accordance with the needs of communities and statutory bodies.  These are run as pilot programmes for between one and three years and are then evaluated.  If successful, they are mainstreamed into the relevant Departments or agencies, the financial resources go with them and they become part of the existing levels of services run by those Departments.  That has been the policy over the years.We all know there is pressure with regard to next year's budget.  Many Departments, programmes and agencies will have their budgets cut by 5%, 7.5%, 10% or 12.5%.  That is the way of the world these days and we have to live with that.  People half expect this to happen.  However, it is totally different when the Department of Education and Science announces it is withdrawing from a range of projects over a two-year period.  It cannot do that.  It signed up to the strategy, which is Government policy and was launched by the Taoiseach a few months ago.  These programmes were part of the existing level of service to which money was transferred over the years.  Now t hat it is under pressure the Department seems to be retreating to its core activities of looking after primary and secondary teachers and nothing else.  It cannot be allowed do that.  That is unacceptable and is contrary to the strategy launched only some weeks ago.I am speaking specifically from the point of view of my constituency, which has two local drugs task forces — in Finglas and in Ballymun.  The one in Ballymun, in particular, had a large share of educational-type projects that will be affected by the cuts.  The overall funding for the 12 local drugs task forces is only approximately €3.5 million, 25% of which seems to be for a number of projects in Ballymun.  These are good projects.  Health projects that treat drug users are important, but from a long-term sustainable point of view it is very important to get at young kids, many of whom are being reared in houses where there is a drug user or in dysfunctional families.  The investment in these families at the level of provision of education programmes for young children is worthwhile.However, now the message is coming from the Department of Education and Science that the cut for 2010 only affects non-staff level.  These are all staff matters.  Some of the moneys are grants to different agencies, but they are all being used to provide staff, some of whom are contract staff and some of whom are established.  There is very little fat in the projects.I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, who is standing in for the Minister for Education and Science, that the Department must accept its policy is to be involved in the Government drugs strategy.  It cannot run away from that because it has signed up to the policy.  It used to be the case that this issue was dealt with at the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion.  I do not know if there has been any co-ordination between that sub-committee and the Department with regard to the cuts or whether the Department has gone off on its own bat.  If I receive no news on the matter tonight, I ask that the Department and its officials examine the issue over the Christmas period.  Hopefully, when we come back early in the new year the Department will see to it that the work continues.  If there must be a 10% cut, that is to be expected, but the Department cannot welsh on its commitments.  If it is not going to do the business, it should hand back the money to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and let that Department provide the allocation directly.This is a cheap, shoddy and scandalous move by the Department of Education and Science.  I ask the Minister of State to raise the matter directly with the Minister and try and see the issue is addressed within the next few weeks.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	734	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an ábhar tábhachtach seo a chur os comhair na Dála.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.I thank Deputy Noel Ahern for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the involvement of the Department of Education and Science with these projects and its ongoing contribution to the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Some 22 of the projects are administered by the City of Dublin Youth Services Board under the aegis of the City of Dublin VEC.  Ten of the projects are administered by County Dublin VEC and three projects are administered by Dún Laoghaire VEC.  The remaining three projects are administered directly by the Department.In the current financial year, the Department has provided a total of €3.643 million for these projects.  Of this amount, the allocation for the six projects in Ballymun amounted to €712,000 and the allocation for the two projects in the Finglas-Cabra area amounted to €312,000.  Overall, in the four years 2005 to 2008, the Department provided a total allocation of over €14 million for all the projects.  The allocation for 2010 for the projects in local drugs task force areas has been reduced by €1.182 million to €2.641 million.  The Minister has also indicated that funding for the projects will cease with effect from 2011.The Minister wants to reassure the House that he remains fully committed to implementing the national drugs strategy.  In that regard, he wants to place on record the significant contribution the Department has made, and continues to make, in support of the prevention pillar of the strategy, through the following initiatives: the introduction of a social, personal and health education, or SPHE, curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle, second-level; the initiatives under delivering equality of opportunity in schools, or DEIS action plan and the school support programme to prevent early school leaving and achieve better educational outcomes for students; and the guidelines on substance use policies issued to all schools.The SPHE programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drugs and alcohol issues in schools.  It is a mandatory part of the curriculum at primary and junior cycle in second level.  The substance use modules of SPHE are augmented by two support programmes, the Walk Tall programme at primary level and On My Own Two Feet at post-primary.  The implementation of these programmes in schools is supported by full-time support services at primary and second level, which provide professional development for teachers and advice and support to schools.  The DEIS action plan for educational inclusion is aimed at identifying and tackling levels of disadvantage and it provides the basis for school supports to, among others, schools located in local drugs task force areas.  Supports targeting children most at risk of leaving school early are currently being enhanced through the integration of the relevant services, that is, the school completion programme, the home-school community liaison and the visiting teacher service for Travellers, under the National Educational Welfare Board.  Through the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Government is continuing to support initiatives for youth, such as the young people's facilities and services fund, which aims to divert young people away from the dangers of substance abuse and the special projects for youth scheme, which supports out-of-school projects for disadvantaged young people.The Minister acknowledges the difficulties which the budget announcement will entail for the projects the Department has been supporting over the years, but he wants to assure the House that his commitment to the implementation of the national drugs strategy through the measures outlined is undiminished.

Many of our programmes, however, both individually and collectively, focus in particular on communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat.  The key principle underlying my Department's activities is the provision of support that enables communities themselves to identify and address problems in their own areas so that they become self-reliant.While the overall cut of 14% across the Developing Communities subheads of my Department’s Vote will have an impact, my Department will be endeavouring to protect front-line services as far as possible. Every saving that can be made from cutting down on overheads will be pursued so that the services that have been developed in partnership with communities over the years can be retained.  Notwithstanding this reduction, the 2010 allocation will facilitate continued support for communities through local and community development programmes, supports for volunteering, supports for locally-based community and voluntary groups, the Community Services Programme, Community Supports for Older People and other measures. Every effort will be made to direct resources in a targeted and effective manner so as to ensure maximum impact in all priority areas.

There are currently 2,600 participant places available under the RSS and 130 supervisor places (full time equivalents).  With the reductions in certain rates of social welfare payments and the CE Scheme, there will be similar adjustments in RSS participant payment rates. However, the Scheme will continue to provide a very good source of additional income for part-time farmers and fisherpersons and a highly valuable resource for community activity in our rural areas.  Since the introduction of the RSS, it has become a key part of community activity in many rural areas and is very popular with both participants and local community organisations. The Scheme provides resources to maintain and improve local amenities and facilities in our rural areas with a total of 1,828 community organisations benefiting from it so far this year.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 45 together.The Rural Transport Evening/Night Scheme was implemented in 2007 as a pilot project in seven selected areas, with funding from my Department. This pilot scheme was in addition to the rural transport services already provided in the seven areas under the Department of Transport's ‘Rural Transport Programme'.   The pilot arrangement was designed to operate for a limited period only and will cease at end-2009. It was intended to give the rural transport groups involved an opportunity to pilot certain evening/night-time services that, ultimately, could be considered for inclusion in their main transport services.Having had the experience of piloting such services, the seven groups concerned have been assessing their overall services with a view to the possible inclusion of more evening/night-time transport services.  In this regard, Pobal, which manages both the Rural Transport Programme and the pilot scheme, has been working with the Groups over the past few months.  This work includes making all possible efforts to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the transport service.  It involves prioritising routes, increasing load capacity, re-tendering to operators to seek cheaper quotes, where appropriate, and focussing more on generating income from passengers. I would like to see the seven groups, and indeed, all other service providers, assess their services to identify how best to meet the transport needs of the rural communities they serve, with the inclusion as necessary of more evening/night-time services in their main rosters.I understand that some of the rural transport service groups already provide a level of these services and, based on the experiences of the pilot scheme, evening/night-time services can now be further considered. Decisions in this regard are within the remit of the service providers, in their implementation locally of the Rural Transport Programme.  In this regard, I am pleased to note that the provision available to my colleague, Noel Dempsey T.D., Minister for Transport, for the Rural Transport Programme is being maintained at €11 million for 2010.  I believe that delivery of a quality service to rural communities while, at the same time, ensuring value for money will be core to the work of the Rural Transport Programme in the current economic climate.

Minister for Finance, for his consideration. As the Deputy knows, the economic and social implications of climate change are immense and it is the responsibility of Governments everywhere to change behaviour to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The most effective way is to put a price on carbon which will encourage innovation by incentivising companies to bring low carbon products and services to the market.  The yield from the carbon tax will be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty.

The programme, which Pobal manages on behalf of my Department, is implemented locally by 37 Integrated Local Development Companies and 16 Urban Partnerships.  These are not-for-profit companies that target the areas of greatest need in the country, to provide an area-based response to long-term unemployment and to promote social inclusion.Allocations made by Pobal under the LDSIP are based on a number of factors, including the size/population of the catchment areas of the local development company, the proposed annual programme of activity of each company, and the deprivation index for the catchment area. My Department approves the broad approach adopted by Pobal and I am satisfied that there is broad equity in the application of available resources. Such distribution is kept under review.  As I have previously indicated to the House, the LDSIP and Community Development Programme (CDP) come to an end on 31 December 2009 and will be superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme. The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDP/LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

Under the Programme, the main measure providing direct support for investment and job creation is the ‘Support for Business Creation and Development' measure.  Funding for the LEADER elements of the RDP will amount to €425m and in the region of 12,000 new jobs are expected to be created during the lifetime of the Programme. Job creation targets under the Programme are as follows:Diversification into non-agricultural activities — 1,500 full-time equivalents — the main focus of this measure is to create alternative on-farm employment opportunities in non-agricultural activities and services.Support for business creation and development — 7,200 off-farm, 800 on-farm — the continuing change in farming patterns, allied to a need to provide alternative employment and enterprise options to rural dwellers, gives rise to the need to focus on the economic development of rural resources.Encouragement of tourism activities — 350 off-farm, 150 on-farm — in most rural areas, tourism is an integral component of wider rural enterprise and it is intended that both should be developed in an integrated manner, whenever possible.Village renewal and development — 1,000 full-time equivalents — villages and small towns are the focal point for a significant section of the rural community and, as such, are a priority for infrastructural development.  The focus for improvement will extend to the enhancement of villages, small towns and the surrounding countryside.Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage — 750 full-time equivalents — under this measure, conservation actions should be extended to include not just conservation and protection actions for the natural, cultural, social and vernacular heritage but also encompass pro-active initiatives in relation to the utilisation of local resources to provide sustainable and renewable energy options for local communities.In addition to the funding outlined above, funding of some €62.5m is being provided in my Department's Vote for the Gaeltacht in 2010. This includes an allocation of €30.5m for Údarás na Gaeltachta to enable it to continue its work in creating employment and training opportunities in Gaeltacht areas, as well as proving pre-school childcare, youth and language development services.  An tÚdarás will also continue to administer the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund in Gaeltacht areas in 2010.

Accordingly, in the 2010 Budget the Government decided, as part of its strategy to manage its way through the current severe economic crisis and to return the country to prosperity, to reduce spending on public services by almost €1 billion in 2010 compared with the pre-Budget estimates. To the greatest extent possible, the savings have been sought through efficiencies rather than through reductions in services.  In the case of my own Department, gross funding at €415.426m in 2010 is a reduction of 13% relative to the 2009 allocation of  €475.701m. Current funding is reduced by 9%, a decrease of €32.1m, and capital funding is reduced by 21%, a decrease of €28.175m.In a joint statement with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr John Curran, T.D., on Budget Day, we stressed that our primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities. Every saving that can be made from cutting down on overheads will be pursued so that the entire range of urban, rural, Gaeltacht and island communities we serve retain, to the greatest extent possible, the services that have been developed in partnership with them over the years.  I am arranging to forward directly to the Deputies a copy of our joint statement in this matter.

Every saving that can be made from cutting down on overheads and improving efficiency will be pursued. In this context, several schemes are being, or have been reviewed, with a view to achieving such efficiencies. Details of recent relevant amendments to schemes funded by my Department include the following:Whilst delivery of the scheme of Community Support for Older People (CSOP) is ongoing following a recent review, revised arrangements to improve its operation will be introduced early next year.The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) and the Community Development Programme (CDP) will come to an end on 31st December 2009 and will be superseded by a new Programme, the Local and Community Development Programme.  The aim of the new Programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.In relation to the RAPID Programme, a boundary review that was carried out during 2009 has led to the inclusion of five new towns into the Programme.  The remainder of this review is currently being considered within my Department.Gaeltacht policy and schemes were reviewed as a result of the Report of the Linguistic Study on the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  A draft 20- year Strategy for Irish, which took this study into account, has recently been published and submitted for consideration by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Any changes to Departmental schemes in the Gaeltacht will be considered in this context.Due to other commitments to be met from the capital allocation for island development for 2010, no grants are currently being approved under the Enterprise Scheme for non-Gaeltacht Islands.  Funding is, however, available from Comhar na nOileáin, the Island LEADER Company for Enterprise development.

Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of October 2009, transfers to the DAF have totalled some €513.9m.  Funds reclaimed by account holders since April 2003 total some €182.8m.  The value of the DAF at the end of October 2009, net of liabilities, was some €49.8m.  This figure excludes €45m maintained in a Reserve Account to meet future reclaims by account holders and to cover expenses associated with the operation of the DAF.Of the 9,393 applications received to date, 9,246 applications have been assessed with 6,509 or 70% of these recommended for funding.  The number of applications not recommended or deemed ineligible for funding to date has amounted to 2,737 or 30% of assessed applications.  In addition, the Government agreed to provide €64.4m to support the Rural Social Scheme, which has national coverage, between the years 2004 and 2008.

This project is an innovative measure funded by my Department and implemented by DIT which provides IT access, learning/qualifications to disadvantaged communities.  The Department has confirmed its support to fund this initiative for 2010, but has no plans to roll out the initiative to other areas at this juncture.

Published in November, it details deaths that were indirectly caused by drugs over the eight year period from 1998 to 2005.  It is a follow-on publication from the National Drugs Related Deaths Index (NDRDI), published in late 2008, when details of deaths directly related to drug taking were made available.  The data presented show an increasing number of deaths that are indirectly related to drug taking, rising from 63 in 1998 to 167 in 2005. The total number of deaths over the period was 885.  These deaths arose from traumatic and from medical causes and I extend my deepest sympathy to everyone affected by them.I hope that this publication will serve to re-emphasise the message of the dangers of drugs.  Apart from being a direct cause of death, drug taking can cause heart attacks, strokes, seizures and chest problems as well as a range of severe mental problems.  Furthermore, I hope that the publication of stark facts in the overall NDRDI will help to prevent people from starting a drugs habit, and will help others to consider their use of drugs, to seek treatment and ultimately to become drug free.The information from the NDRDI contributed to the process of drawing up the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  I believe that the new Strategy will facilitate tackling of the drugs problem comprehensively over the coming years.  Also, the Deputy should note that work has commenced on development of a National Substance Misuse Strategy to combine the approach to drugs and alcohol.    A Steering Group, jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Health & Children, has been established in that regard and interested parties have been invited to submit their views on the content of the combined policy by the end of January.

I would like to reassure those affected of the Government's concerns in regard to the hardship caused by these events.  In relation to funding, as the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2010 that in excess of €70 million would be provided for the remainder of 2009 and into 2010 to help those affected by recent flooding and to fund works to minimise the risks of future incidents.  The Deputy is also aware of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), which provides for payments to be made to assist people in exceptional circumstances.  The Minister of Finance also stated that the Government is keeping this situation under review and will commit further resources as required.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	755	As I outlined previously to the Dáil and Seanad, my Department has seen the need to redesign its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the Local Development Social Inclusion (LDSIP) and Community Development Programmes (CDP), drawing on best international practice, and to support the ongoing evaluation of the programmes.  The LDSIP and the CDP are my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes. Both have a community development element and are currently delivered through separate local delivery structures. These programmes come to an end on 31 December 2009 and will be superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP). The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDP/LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.In advance of proceeding to establish a single programme across CDPs and Partnerships, my Department undertook an evaluation of individual community development projects. Many of these projects span across two decades, with quite diverse activities. The objective of the review was to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve. The vast majority of projects fall into this category and funding will be available to them, subject to budgetary constraints, through the new programme in 2010. For 2010 I have ring-fenced CDP funding. For those projects that do not come into this category, continued funding from my Department will not be available. However, an appeals mechanism has been put in place and has been notified to all concerned.Any company which decides not to sign up to the new programme can opt out and my Department will adopt a positive approach in relation to the retention of assets, etc, subject to the normal safeguards. Such companies would be free to seek funding from other funders and my Department would be supportive of that. However, it will not be possible to provide LCDP funding in those situations.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	756	I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 56, 70, 234, 235 and 236 together.In 2010, funding of €36.2m is being made available for drugs initiatives supported through my Department, an overall reduction of approximately 11%.  While this funding will allow for a significant number of projects in Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces to be maintained, I acknowledge that the reduction may result in the scaling back of some projects.  However, my Department will be seeking to have front-line services protected to the greatest extent possible.  In excess of €31 million has been made available to fund the activities of Drugs Task Forces next year of which €21.06m is being provided for the Local Drugs Task Forces and €10m for the Regionals.  Despite the overall reduction in funding available, I am confident that the work of the Drugs Task Forces will continue to make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by drug misuse.In this context, the Deputies should note that over the past few months, I met with all Drugs Task Forces and funding for 2010 was among the issues discussed in all cases.  I emphasised the need to prioritise projects with a view to ensuring the most effective use of resources and the most beneficial outcomes for service users.  Needs and priorities change over time and consequently, Drugs Task Forces and service providers must ensure that funding is realigned to match changing circumstances.  The Task Forces are fully engaged in this process and I have given them the scope to redirect funding within their allocations to best address the realigned priorities that they identify for their areas of operation.  I am satisfied that this approach will help to minimise the impact from the reduction in funding in 2010.All of the Task Forces have now received their allocation for 2010 and have been asked to return their detailed funding proposals to the Office of the Minister for Drugs (OMD) by 16th December.  On 10th November last, my Department wrote to each Task Force setting out the procedures in relation to the 2010 allocations.  Given the likelihood of a reduction in monies for drugs initiatives in 2010, Task Forces were asked to review all projects being funded by them to ensure that they were drugs targeted and evidence-based; can show tangible outputs and outcomes; are addressing current gaps and local needs in their areas and can demonstrate clear links with the priorities as set out in the National Drug Strategy 2009-16.The Task Forces were similarly asked to identify the areas to assimilate a reduction in funding in 2010.  These could include negotiating rents and administration charges; lowering overheads; sharing resources; partnership approach and merging.  My Department strongly recommended that this exercise be undertaken and completed by the end of November.  I am satisfied that the detailed guidelines already advised to the Task Forces have been — and continue to be — taken into account by their members, including community sector representatives.  The OMD is in on-going contact with representatives of the statutory agencies which act as channels of funding for the Task Force projects.  Every effort is being made by the Office to ensure that funding will be released to the projects at the earliest possible opportunity in 2010.In addition, I have made provision for essential funding for the first two weeks of January to be made available to a number of projects where this has been identified as necessary.  I am satisfied that two weeks of funding is the appropriate amount required.  During 2010, it is my intention to review the funding procedures in place in relation to drugs initiatives to see whether any adjustments are necessary.

Prior to the establishment of this fund, my Department had provided funding to a number of individual universities for this purpose.  Details are set out as follows, in tabular form, of the funding provided by my Department for the promotion and teaching of Irish in 3rd Level institutions abroad for the period 2005 to 2009.YearAmount€200559,6642006374,7742007609,8932008760,8402009 (to date)992,658Up to 40 3rd level colleges and universities have been supported with this funding, including Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, New York State, St Thomas Heuston, Poznan, and Mannheim and Marburg University in Germany.  The average annual grant is €20,000.This funding initiative has proved extremely successful in raising the profile and perceived status of the Irish language at home and abroad, and in opening up opportunities for personal and career development for young Irish language teachers and other professionals.  It also develops positive links at Governmental and university level between Ireland and other participating countries, as well as the interpersonal contacts that are so important in the long-term in ensuring a positive awareness of Ireland among our EU partners and further afield.I would mention in particular the two-way exchanges promoted via our participation in the Fulbright Commission's programme and in partnership with the Ireland-Canada University Foundation.  Aside from the value in terms of promotion of the language, there is a direct economic return in cultural tourism terms, as many of the international students who study Irish in their home institutions will continue their studies in Ireland.

These include measures addressing the issue of urban and rural isolation, for example, the Community Supports for Older People and grant provision to organisations such as St Vincent de Paul and Protestant Aid.  Details of the programmes and schemes operated by my Department, including guidelines, criteria and recipients of grant support, are available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie. All applications for funding received by my Department are assessed in line with the eligibility criteria of the relevant schemes and decisions made accordingly.  If the Deputy has a specific application or project in mind, I will be happy to consider the matter on receipt of further information from him.

My Department is working in collaboration with the HEA, King's Inns and a number of other bodies and institutions in relation to the development of such courses, which will help increase the number of professionals with particular skills in order to meet the requirements of the Irish language at the EU, as well as of the Official Languages Act 2003 at home.The initiative has proved a considerable success with a total of eight full-time courses now being delivered. These include an MA in Irish language conference interpretation — the first of its kind in Ireland — as well as an MA in legal translation, both of which are provided by NUI Galway. In addition, funding has also been provided for an intensive, short-term course for lawyer linguists provided by Kings Inns, and an intensive short-term course in legal translation provided by Europus Teo in Co. Galway.  Other initiatives relevant to this area and which have received funding from my Department include, for example, the development by Fiontar, Dublin City University, of a database of EU terminology in the Irish language. The database also includes terminology required for translation of statutory instruments.In relation to the use of Irish at the EU, as the Deputy is aware, elections were held to the European Parliament in June 2009.  My understanding is that the level of usage of Irish has been maintained in the new Parliament and that, in general, there is satisfaction at the level of Irish being used in the various EU institutions — though I would continue to stress the value of Ministers using Irish at meetings as much as possible.  Finally, I should also say that the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009 will result in the extension of co-decision to cover almost all legislative acts, which will, in turn, lead to a considerable increase in the number of EU legal instruments being translated into Irish.  I understand that the relevant EU institutions are preparing for these new demands and plan on recruiting extra staff.

Funding is also provided by Foras na Gaeilge.  The details of the funding provided in the years in question under these various measures are set out in the following Table.At its meeting in Language Format on 14 December, the North South Ministerial Council welcomed the fact that Foras na Gaeilge had completed a review of the 19 organisations core-funded by it, noted the findings of the review and the options proposed, and agreed that core-funding of the Irish language voluntary sector by Foras na Gaeilge be reconfigured to ensure a more streamlined and cost effective way to move forward while ensuring that proper governance arrangements are in place.  I am confident that the outcome of this review will lead to a more effective, integrated and dynamic Irish language voluntary sector.  For the sake of completeness, the Deputy should note that it is also open to voluntary Irish language organisations to apply for assistance under other grant schemes operated by my Department to provide support for organisations in the community and voluntary sector.(i) Current FundingOrganisation20052006200720082009€€€€€Gaillimh le Gaeilge112,720152,580225,650178,726165,600Gnó Mhaigh Eo——155,965165,000151,800Gael-Taca74,50055,95081,59090,87074,520Glór na nGael10,00040,00048,35051,50050,000Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe450,000450,000480,000463,343441,600Total647,220698,530991,555949,439883,520Organisation20052006200720082009€€€€€Conradh na Gaeilge Luimneach, Áras Íde——112,000206,000—Conradh na Gaeilge Sráid Fheachair, Baile Átha Cliath,————179,478Total——112,000206,000179,478Gaeltacht OrganisationsAmount20052006200720082009€€€€€Gaelachas Teo14,814.0022,648.0021,861.0024,874.5026,323.50Eagraíocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta21,000.000.0090,200.00154,368.0083,403.00Oideas Gael37,500.0075,000.0098,750.0082,474.0063,750.00Gaeil Uladh220,000.00148,728.00257,335.00320,716.00165,618.00Áisleann Chill Chartha Teo3,160.000.0062,342.0055,050.008,402.00Coiste Céim Aniar54,720.0021,360.0080,000.0071,550.001,900.00Comharchumann Forbartha Ghaoth Dobhair54,000.0038,520.0096,000.00103,150.0082,225.00CLG Ghaoth Dobhair0.000.0070,000.0075,950.0020,000.00Lár Chomh.

In this context, my focus in recent months has been to improve inter-agency working and co-operation between statutory and voluntary service providers and to this end, a small working group, chaired by my Department, is currently working through a number of issues.Before I would consider channelling Drugs Task Force funding into privately run treatment programmes, I would need to be fully satisfied that the quality standards and clinical governance arrangements, as set down for residential treatment providers, are being adhered to and complied with.  In the context of more limited resources that will be available in the short to medium term, such programmes would also have to show that they are competitive and represent value for money.

Waterways Ireland's remit does not include responsibility for flood relief.  Notwithstanding this and within its own sphere of competency, I am informed that, during the recent unprecedented heavy rainfalls, Waterways Ireland monitored water levels on a daily basis and adjusted water levels on the canals to anticipate rises.  Waterways Ireland liaised closely with the local authorities to provide updates on water levels, and was also in daily contact with the ESB in relation to the Shannon Navigation.  I am also advised that Waterways Ireland cordoned off public areas that were flooded across the navigational network to ensure public safety and carried out works to minimise the effects of flooding, both to its own infrastructure and in respect of vessels moored on the navigation.

Figures are published for each county and each social welfare office.   The most recent information is for November 2009.  The number of persons signing on in the Tallaght social welfare office on the last Friday in November 2009 was 9,725.  It should be noted that the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.  The Job Initiative Programme (JI) was launched in July 1996 and continues to provide full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities. The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities. Following changes introduced by Minister Micheál Martin on 10 November 2004, no new entrants have been admitted onto the Job Initiative Schemes. However, contracts for existing participants are renewed allowing them the option to continue until they are 65 years of age. Where persons do leave the Job Initiative Scheme that place can be allocated as a Community Employment place.  The information requested by the Deputy will take some time to collate.  I will contact the Deputy once this has been completed.

With regard to agency assisted companies only, my Department operates an internal early warning system of potential job losses based on material provided on a confidential basis by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	772	Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the Deputy with the specific information he has requested as the Department does not collate statistics for redundancy payment claims on the basis of local authority boundaries.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that at this time my focus and that of my Department is on ensuring that redundancy payments are processed as quickly as possible.I can advise the Deputy that the latest figures available to end November 2009 indicate that, on a national basis, the number of redundancy claims awaiting processing stands at 42,591.  I should point out that my Department has, since 1 January processed 45,201 claims and made corresponding payments amounting to €287m (provisional figures) which results in average weekly payments to the value of €6.5m being issued.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first eleven months of 2009 is 73,024, up 96% on the same period last year (37,257).  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.

Additionally, almost €1.4m has been approved by Enterprise Ireland in 2009 to 32 companies for activities such as Research and Development, Management Development, Mentoring, Trade Fair Participation and other supports designed to aid the development and growth of client companies.Figures for the County Enterprise Boards are compiled on an annual basis and figures in respect of 2009 will not be available until early in 2010. However, Kildare County Enterprise Board have received approximately 57 applications seeking financial assistance of which 26 grant applications have been approved for funding to date, totalling  €319,000.  FÁS estimates that expenditure in 2009 will exceed €20 million on training and employment programmes in County Kildare.  To date in 2009, FÁS has been in direct contact with:133 companies regarding the Work Placement Programme,148 companies promoting the business improvement tool Excellence Through People, and422 companies with over 900 apprentices, many who availed of the Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme and the other supports to assist with redundant apprentices.It is expected that approximately 3,000- 3,500 people will avail of FÁS programmes directly in County Kildare this year.

There are three Enterprise Ireland staff directly associated with the Dublin and Mid East Regional Office, although companies in Kildare will frequently have interaction with a greater number of Enterprise Ireland personnel for specific areas of expertise, including, Development Advisers in specific sectors for business development; Market Advisers for international selling; Technologists for advice and assistance in relation to Research, Development and Innovation; and also in areas including management development and training, productions and investment.Kildare County Enterprise Board encompasses the area of Kildare South and provides a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  The Board's primary function is to promote enterprise development, business growth and job creation.  The Board is located at The Woods, Clane, County Kildare and has a staff complement of four — a Chief Executive Officer, an Assistant Chief Executive Officer, a Business Adviser and an Administrator.  The IDA East Regional Office in Wilton Park House, Dublin serves the Kildare area and has a total number of 3 staff assigned.

The full range of destinations is still being finalised at this stage.  Trade Missions provide an opportunity for Enterprise Ireland client companies to develop links in a market, to win export sales, to engage in international partnerships and joint ventures and establish in-market presences.  A focus on exporting underpins all missions, ranging from export opportunities identified in the mission market, market opportunities for specific firms or sectors and future growth opportunities.  Given this exclusive emphasis on companies that are trying to grow their exports in specific markets, it is unlikely that local authorities and other locally based organizations would benefit from the very focused work of such Trade Missions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas, and it is not a matter in which the Minister of the day has any involvement.  The use to which IDA property can be put is prescribed by legislation and the disposal of property for any alternative use requires the consent of the Minister of the day.  However, the Agency is always available to discuss proposals regarding availability or suitability of individual buildings with Local Authorities, Enterprise Boards or Community Groups and I will be happy to consider any request for such consent should it be required.As I stated previously, Kildare County Council confirmed to IDA in January 2009 that due to the financial position facing Kildare County Council at that time the local authority was not in a position to purchase IDA sites in Athy, Castledermot or Monasterevin in South Kildare. There is no IDA land available in Kildare town.  The situation will be reviewed again early next year and should the same situation remain with Kildare County Council regarding the acquisition of the lands, IDA will consider open market disposal of some or all of these lands.  This will be dependent on the open market conditions prevailing at that time.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received two statutory lump sum claims in respect of former employees of the company on 30 October 2009 and 5 November 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  These applications are awaiting processing.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.

Upon completion of the course individuals are required to re-submit a claim to the Department of Social and Family Affairs where they have not secured employment. FÁS evening courses and many of the e-learning/online/blended learning courses do not provide a training allowance so learners may continue to receive their social welfare payment for the duration.There may remain a perception among many FÁS clients who are in receipt of a welfare payment that they will incur a lengthy delay in having their payment re-instated. However, I understand that the Department of Social and Family Affairs, at a central level, has instructed their local offices to ‘fast-track' or prioritize such claimants so that there should not be significant delays in having their payments re-instated.Officials from my Department, FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs meet regularly and will continue to explore measures to encourage the unemployed to participate in training. This includes examining measures to ease the transition and reduce any inconvenience for individuals in transferring between the social welfare and the FÁS training allowance payment systems.  The retention of social welfare benefits while claimants are participating on training courses is a matter for the Minister of Social and Family Affairs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	779	As enterprise support agencies the interaction of the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) with their local Community is generally confined to matters of delivering financial and non-financial supports to eligible local enterprises in the micro-enterprise sector and to the promotion of entrepreneurial activities.  It was in the context of this remit that I recently asked the CEBs to collect information on the impact of the flooding on their local client businesses in order to assist in framing the overall Government response to the situation.The national response to the flooding crisis was overseen by the Emergency Response Coordination Committee (operating under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government). An integral part of this response is the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which provides means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damage in their homes and is being administered by the local Community Welfare Services. This Scheme does not cover commercial or business interests.In relation to businesses affected by flooding damage the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland are available to offer advice to client businesses and their normal financial supports remain available to eligible clients. However it is primarily for the Insurance Sector to respond to affected businesses under the terms of their commercial insurance policies. This Sector should respond quickly and appropriately to claims and should ensure that payments flow back to policyholders to facilitate early resumption of business. In addition the Banking Sector has a role to play in supporting businesses coping with the impact of flood damage.  It is imperative that such businesses receive supportive responses from banks to requests for working capital loans and re-stocking loans and for any temporary adjustments to loan facilities already in operation.  Some individual insurance companies and banks have committed publicly to offering speedy and appropriate assistance to businesses impacted by the floods.I do not envisage the CEBs having a broad-based lead role in assessing and collating the damage, and the cost incurred, arising from the recent flooding, nor indeed would they have the capacity to undertake such a role.  However I will continue to monitor the situation as it affects local businesses based on relevant information that becomes available to the CEBs.

However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 applies to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the €2 rate. Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand. The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists are only subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a limited effect on tourist numbers. The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. In the case of Ireland the decline in passenger numbers through our airports are broadly in line with our international counterparts. This downward trend is evident for periods prior to the introduction of the air travel tax. Furthermore, passenger numbers for other modes of transport have also experienced broadly similar declines. This is not a desirable situation, but it is clear that the air travel tax is not the substantive cause for the decline in passenger numbers.We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.

There is scope under the Energy Tax Directive to apply a lower rate of excise duty on auto-diesel in respect of certain local public passenger transport services and certain other commercial users, once the EU minimum rate is observed. However, the introduction of any such preferential treatment would require an extensive rebate system. It is estimated that a relief from carbon tax for local public passenger transport services using the same criteria as the previous excise duty rebate would cost in the region of €5m per annum. However, using the same criteria would not be possible under EU law and any relief would need to be wider in scope, but would also exclude some of those companies that had benefited from the previous excise relief scheme. It is estimated that a general carbon tax relief for commercial users of auto-diesel would cost the Exchequer approximately €70m per annum.

The Review Group on Longer-Term Lending Limits under Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 met yesterday 15th December 2009 and has reported substantial progress on a proposal to review the legislation to meet the current need.  This current proposal focuses on the issues of rescheduling of existing loans while ensuring proper systems, controls and reporting arrangements are in place.  I anticipate being in a position to examine this final proposal in early January 2010.  However, it is essential that each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.

These provisions are designed to promote greater compliance having regard to the risk factors associated with non-resident taxpayers and ensure, in the case of non-resident landlords who don't have a representative here, that a minimum tax payment is made in respect of rental income arising here.  A non-resident landlord will normally pay income tax in his or her own country of tax residence in respect of worldwide income (including Irish source rental income), subject to a credit for Irish tax deducted if there is a double taxation treaty in place.

The injection was treated under National Accounting rules as a financial investment, and under Eurostat rules, does not count for GGB accounting purposes.  The interest on the €4 billion borrowed in order to make the capital injection does have negative effect on the GGB.  As a general rule of thumb, each €1 billion extra borrowed is estimated to cost the Exchequer about €60 million per year in interest costs.  Such interest costs are included as part of the estimate of the General Government Balance, GGB.  The GGB impact of any potential future capital injection to the banking sector would depend on the precise terms of the capital provision, and its treatment under National accounting rules would be a matter for consultation with Eurostat.

I am also cognisant that other countries have signalled their interest in introducing similar provisions.  However, I have no plans to introduce such measures here at this time.  Where banks have received State support in the form of guarantee or recapitalisation, this has been conditional on restrictions on top level pay and bonuses.  The question of how to regulate the financial system to prevent future crises is being actively debated in the EU and elsewhere.  We will update our regulatory and other systems in line with best international practice at the appropriate time.

On this basis the total numbers of public sector employees in the counties mentioned by the Deputy, and the breakdown of those numbers by income ranges, is set out as follows:Range of Gross IncomeDonegalCavanLouthMonaghanFromToNumbersNumbersNumbersNumbers€€—20,00020,6588,79415,0888,81820,00030,0006,4374,1286,5103,69630,00040,0002,3362,1203,1181,71040,00050,0001,0389931,70081650,00060,00053760490639560,00070,00037139160523070,00080,00018119839114580,00090,0001091372497990,000100,000588414845100,000150,0006912626265Over150,00012316513Totals31,80617,60629,04216,012An estimated breakdown of the figures on a geographical basis is available on the basis of "bailiwick", meaning, in this case, the jurisdiction or boundaries within which Revenue Sheriffs, County Registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt.  It equates geographically with "county" while also providing separate breakdowns for "city" and "county" in the case of counties Dublin and Cork.  The data relating to the allocation by city or county of PAYE employees should be treated with caution. This is because it has been the practice to associate each employee with the city or county in which his or her employer is registered for PAYE purposes, regardless of the address of the actual workplace or of the individual's home address.  Additionally, the tabulated data does not distinguish atypical work patterns and earnings by employees such as work sharing and temporary or short term work.The source of the information provided in relation to numbers and tax is the P35 end year returns filed by employers in respect of their employees but does not include the corresponding figures relating to PAYE taxpayers who are required to return an income tax return form 11 where non-PAYE income is greater than €3,174.  The data also includes various forms of income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as being employed within the public service, e.g. those receiving fees, those on State Boards etc. It should also be noted that as the data dates from 2007, it does not reflect developments since then; in particular the revised contracts for Hospital Consultants which are being implemented this year.The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4-digit NACE code (Rev. 1), which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The information provided in relation to Public Sector employees is based on activities which are classified in the NACE code system as Public Administration and Defence; compulsory Social Security, Education and Health and Social work but excluding the categories of Driving School Activities, Dental Practice Activities and Veterinary Activities as being more appropriate to the Private Sector.  A married couple, which has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment, is counted as one tax unit.

The number of small offices located in this region is a legacy of the prior existence of small Customs and Excise stations or Vehicle Registration Offices, which are no longer needed in the context of Revenue's modern service delivery.  Generally, only limited services are delivered from these small offices and, in the case of Drogheda, these services are not specific to the town.Revenue has an obligation to address the question of the proper use and management of resources, particularly given the current economic circumstances.  In that context, the functions carried out in the Drogheda office are under review at present.  The Drogheda review commenced in October when Regional Management met with the staff concerned with regard to their preferences. A systematic review of the functions carried out in Drogheda and the rationale for their location in Drogheda is ongoing. One function, the control of Drogheda Port, transferred to Dundalk in early December. This resulted in one staff member voluntarily transferring with the work. No final decision on the remaining functions has been taken to date.

The Bank’s Ireland division accounts for 60% of all lending with 26% and 14% in the UK and US respectively. Loan balances include €14.4 billion to the Bank’s top 20 regulatory customer groups. Each of these groups consists of a number of connected entities and the balances represent multiple individual loans secured by diverse portfolios of assets and multiple contracted cash flows.New lending in the period was solely to the Bank's existing customer base, primarily in Ireland and confined to amounts which were previously committed or approved to protect asset quality and reduce risk. Growth in lending includes an amount of €0.7 billion relating to capitalised interest during the period, which is an integral feature of development lending. Interest roll-up facilities are also being provided to some clients outside the terms of their original loan facilities due to the lack of demand for completed units. The Bank will continue to approve the provision of additional facilities to customers where it is believed this will ensure the best economic outcome for the Bank in the long term.While core lending margins excluding fees have remained broadly stable, total lending margin, including fees amortised to interest income under IFRS, has declined to 2.26% for the six months to 31 March 2009 from 2.43% for the year ended 30 September 2008. This reflects a significant decrease in lending arrangement fee amortisation income, from €133 million in the six months to March 2008 to €53 million, due to lower new business volumes and the extension of expected lives of loan facilities resulting in a longer income amortisation period for existing fees.Divisional lending balances by sectorInvestment, Business Banking & OtherCommercial DevelopmentResidential DevelopmentTotal€bn€bn€bn€bnIreland31.65.76.043.3UK14.02.42.318.7US9.00.80.510.3Total54.68.98.872.3Investment, business banking and other lending across the Group totals €54.6 billion and comprises investment property lending across all sectors including retail, office, leisure and industrial, together with business lending to the SME and corporate sector and lending for personal investment.Development lending totals €17.7 billion or 24% of the book, inclusive of €10.6 billion of land bank assets.

However, as the Deputy will be aware, I stated in my Second Stage speech on the NAMA Bill on 16 September last that it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital. I also made clear in the speech, to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally that the Government remains committed to providing such banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements in a manner consistent with EU State aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy.

I am informed by the Central Bank that the figures which indicate that the amount of non-bank private sector deposits held at credit institutions' Irish resident offices (item 5, Table C3 in the CBFSAI Monthly Statistics and Quarterly Bulletins) was €280 billion at end October 2009. The equivalent figure for June 2007 is €292 billion (Table 3). Part of the decline in deposits over this period is due to technical factors not related to the underlying level of business, while most of the decline is due to actual transactions.Most of the fall in total deposits is concentrated among "rest of the World" depositors. Deposits held by Irish residents have fallen by less than €1bn from June 2007 to October 2009.

The removal of debris would be a matter for the Riparian owners in this case.  I understand that Kildare County Council is investigating Flooding at the Waterways Estate in Sallins.  This will involve consultation with other agencies, including Irish Rail, Waterways Ireland and a management company, which is currently responsible for the housing estate in question.  Kildare County Council is assessing the factors that gave rise to the flooding in the area.  When the Council have completed their report on the flooding, the OPW will provide the technical advice on appropriate measures to be adopted to alleviate future flood risk in the area.In recognition of the devastation suffered by people due to the recent flooding, the Government has launched a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme, which is being administered by the Community Welfare Service on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The aim of the scheme is to provide financial support, subject to certain conditions, to people who have suffered flood damage to their homes  Furthermore, Local Enterprise Boards have been invited to report to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the impact of the recent flooding on small businesses to which they provide a service.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	810	I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 to 129, inclusive, together.The Health Insurance Acts provide that I, as Minister for Health and Children, have no role to play in the day to day running of and commercial decisions relating to private health insurance companies including the VHI.  In addition, as Minister for Health and Children, I have no role to play in the setting of prices by any of the private health insurance providers. This is a commercial decision for the insurer concerned.  Health insurance prices can be affected by a range of economic considerations including the costs of health care services and other costs and may also reflect the age profile of the customers in any insurer's customer base.  The sole purpose of the temporary scheme of levy/tax relief is to underpin the principle of community rating, so that insured older persons are less likely to face higher increases and/or product segmentation due to their age .  The Government have been clear in our view that the VHI should achieve authorisation on a level playing field with other insurers.  A stable, community-rated health insurance market, supported by a robust risk equalisation system, will be achieved in circumstances where the VHI is authorised and regulated as other health insurance companies are.  The capital position of the VHI at present, and the prospects for its reserves over the medium term, are some of the key factors in the decision of the Financial Regulator to grant authorisation.  Clearly, the reserve position of the VHI is influenced by the measures in place currently, and in prospect for the future, whereby the costs of claims for older people are supported by younger insured persons.A critical issue is the share of older customers among the insurance companies.  VHI's overall market share is 64%, with 32% held between Quinn Healthcare and Hibernian Aviva Insurance (4% is held by restricted undertakings).  However, VHI's share of the 50-59 age group is 71%; it has 80% of the 60-69 age group,  90% of the 70-79 group and 95% of the 80+ group.It is also the case that any system of risk equalisation or tax relief / levy is subject to approval by the European Commission, in relation to both the principles and extent of the scheme.  The ownership by the State of the VHI is a relevant factor in the considerations of the Commission in this regard.  In addition, the European Commission would have to approve any proposal for capitalisation of the VHI by the State according to the prudent investor principle.  There are a great many inter-related factors involved in setting out the roadmap now to a stable, community-rated health insurance market, all of which are under consideration by the Government.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	811	The health insurance levy is part of the interim scheme provided for under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  This interim scheme consists of two distinct elements:(i) age-related tax credit provided at source to private health insurers in respect of persons over the age of 50 who hold private health insurance policies.  This aims to secure a health policy objective of achieving inter-generational solidarity in terms of assisting individuals to meet their health insurance costs on the basis of age, and(ii) a levy charged on private health insurance companies for each insured person in order to fund the age related tax relief so that the scheme remains cost neutral to the Exchequer.I would like to stress that the levy is placed on private health insurance providers for each insured individual, and not on individuals themselves.  It is a matter for the insurers to decide whether or how much of the levy they pass on to their customers.  Insurers with a disproportionate share of older people will be net beneficiaries.  Insurers with mostly younger customers will also have some older customers and receive tax credits in respect of those customers also.  This interim scheme will be in place for a three year period commencing on 1 Jan 2009 and, for cashflow reasons, running into 2012.  Officials in my Department along with the Health Insurance Authority are working on a new scheme of risk equalisation to replace the interim scheme.As Minister for Health and Children, I have no role to play in the setting of prices by any of the private health insurance providers, including VHI.  This is a commercial decision for the insurer concerned.  Health insurance prices can be affected by a range of economic considerations including the costs of health care services and other costs and may also reflect the age profile of the customers in any insurer's customer base.  The scheme's sole purpose is to underpin the principle of community rating, so that insured older persons are less likely to face higher increases and/or product segmentation due to their age.The Government's clear policy objective is that health insurance should remain affordable to a large number of people, particularly to older and sicker people.  To this end, community rating must be the cornerstone of the Irish health insurance market.  The viability of the system relies on the effective operation of solidarity between different generations through which the young subsidise the health care costs of the elderly and are subsidised in their turn by the following generation.  Health insurance should not be risk-rated for increasing age, medical status or claims history.Sustaining community rating requires a legally and financially robust system of risk equalisation to ensure cross-subsidisation across the entire market, not just within each company's cohort of customers or among the holders of each health insurance contract.  As I mentioned, work is now under way to replace the temporary levy and tax relief arrangement with such a robust system of risk equalisation.

Under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin City to the PCRS.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS has processed over 63,000 medical card applications since the start of 2009.The HSE has informed my Department that the transfer of the case load from the two local health offices included a backlog of some 6,500 open cases which are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS, and as a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and telephone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is arranging that additional resources are deployed to respond to telephone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.The Executive has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  The HSE has recently put in place a national on-line system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.The centralising of the medical card application process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications.  The HSE has indicated that a facility is now available where a person can view the status of their medical card application on-line and if a mobile phone number is supplied with an application, updates by text message will be delivered to the applicant's telephone.  I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications.  (Under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.My Department is currently in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for inquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.  This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach in November 2008.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.As the HSE has the operational responsibility for the processing of medical card applications, my Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address the other issues raised by the Deputy and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

Section 22(4)(a) of Health Act 2004 provides that the Executive shall determine the terms and conditions of employment (including terms and conditions in relation to remuneration and allowances) for employees appointed under this section, but my approval and the consent of the Minister for Finance are also required in this context.  Professor Drumm was appointed to his post in August 2005.    The change in numbers employed in the public health service (in wholetime equivalent terms) between 2005 and 2009 is detailed in the table below:Grade category31/12/200531/12/200631/12/200731/12/200831/10/2009Change  (WTE)Medical/ Dental7,266.447,712.388,005.008,109.488,121.54855.10Nursing35,248.4536,737.3439,005.9938,107.9237,636.112,387.66Health & Social Care Professionals13,951.7414,912.9615,704.6715,979.7315,880.291,928.55Management/ Admin16,699.1917,261.6418,043.3617,967.4717,708.161,008.97General Support Staff13,226.5612,909.8112,899.8312,630.5511,998.60-1,227.96Other Patient & Client Care15,585.7516,738.5817,846.0318,230.1518,724.723,138.97Total101,978.13106,272.71111,504.88111,025.30110,069.428,091.29(1) Excludes Home Helps.(2) Student nurses are included in the 2007 and 2008 employment ceilings on the basis of 3.5 students equating to 1 wholetime equivalent.

Accordingly, I have referred these parts of this question to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	828	I have responsibility for the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which is being introduced in January 2010.  I also have responsibility for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which supports community not for profit childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.Children will qualify for the free pre-school year under the ECCE scheme where they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September of the relevant year.  The application of the age range is being interpreted as generously as possible, to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This will mean that, in January 2010, children who were born between 2 February 2005 and 30 June 2006 and are therefore more than 3 years and 6 months and less than 4 year 11 months on the 1 January will be eligible.  I understand that the child referred to by the Deputy, who will be aged 4 years and 2 months in September 2010 and would qualify for the free pre-school year at that time, will instead commence primary school and will not, therefore, avail of the scheme.Parents can also benefit from funding supports for childcare services, including pre-school, through the CCSS.  As referred to above, this scheme is open to community based childcare services to enable disadvantaged and low net income families to benefit from reduced childcare and or pre-school fees.  Should the family in question require further information in regard to the CCSS, they should contact Fingal County Childcare Committee who will advise them of community childcare facilities in their area and the eligibility criteria which apply.

Thirty-six rural community transport groups are being funded under the Programme which is operational in every county. These groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources.In line with the commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government to explore the provision of a full-scale transport system in rural areas using the network expertise of Bus Éireann and the resources of the school and health transport systems, a number of initiatives are currently underway in the country exploring the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers, including rural transport groups and voluntary organisations. These initiatives involve pilot transport projects in the North East and North West, an exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British/Irish Council.  The outcome of these initiatives will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy into the future.

Iarnród Éireann had intended to launch Phase 1 on the 8th of January 2010, with full services commencing on the 9th of January 2010.  However, driver training and familiarisation has been on hold since the 18th of November due to flooding at a number of locations.  As a result, the opening of the line has now been deferred.Iarnród Éireann is currently engaged with repair work that is required after the flooding, including to the signalling system which sustained the most water damage.  Iarnród Éireann anticipates that this repair work will be completed early in January. When this is achieved, driver training of five weeks duration will re-commence and immediately upon completion of the driver training services will commence.  Exact details will be issued by Iarnród Éireann closer to the time but I understand that current expectations are for a launch of services around the second or third week in February.There will be five services per day in each direction Monday to Saturday and these services have been scheduled to best meet all needs taking into account the current commuter paths into both Limerick and Galway and taking cognisance of the capacity constraints of the single line systems.

I have no proposals to change this.  As the country's major gateway Dublin Airport has the capacity to serve the needs of passengers for the foreseeable future.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) regulates airport charges levied at Dublin Airport.  In carrying out its mandate CAR has the following primary statutory objectives under section 33 (1) of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001:(a) to facilitate the efficient  and economic  development and operation  of Dublin Airport  which meet the  requirements of current and prospective users of Dublin Airport(b) to protect the reasonable  interests of current  and prospective users of  Dublin Airport  in relation to Dublin Airport, and(c) to enable  Dublin Airport Authority to operate  and develop  Dublin Airport in a sustainable and financially viable mannerIn its recent airport charges determination of 4th December last, CAR has set out comprehensively its approach to increases authorised for the period 2010-2014.  Details are available on CAR's website (www.aviationreg.ie)  I have no role in the setting of airport charges at Cork and Shannon airports, which is the responsibility of the airport authority. Charges at the six regional airports, which are owned and operated independently, are also a matter for each airport concerned.

The Department of Transport agreed to pay 48% of the total cost, which included the purchase of the site, on a 999-year lease, and the remaining 52% was paid for by the Department of Environment, Heritage & Local Government. The construction of this building was completed in Spring 2008. The Fire Brigade took possession of their section of the building shortly after completion.  Due to legal and contractual matters, the Coast Guard has not been permitted to take possession of their section of the building.The principal issues include the registration of common areas, property management of the building and differences in the planning drawings. The Chief State Solicitor's Office is acting on behalf of my Department and the clear advice received is that without both Mayo County Council and my Department being tenants in common that the Coast Guard will be exposed to ongoing unquantifiable costs over the life of the lease and continual dispute resolution. I believe this is not in the interests of the Coast Guard. My Department has recently confirmed to Mayo County Council that it is willing to pay 50% of the balance owed to allow for a caretaker's agreement which will provide access rights to the volunteers whilst legal difficulties are concluded.  The Director of the Coast Guard and the Director of Services for Mayo County Council are currently dealing directly on the matter and will meet this week.

There is a further €2,267 pending approval.  This cost is made up exclusively of payments to outside counsel.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	861	As I outlined last week in the Dáil in response to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 2 of 10 December decisions in respect of many of the recommendations in relation to structural reform will be a matter for decision by Government in due course. Any expenditure reductions arising, including staff savings, will be included in the budget for the sector in future years.Prior to the report of the McCarthy Group and in recognition of the need to restrict the growth of State bodies and agencies, the Department has devised an Executive Office Model which has provided a streamlined and cost efficient structure for setting up new offices within the Department where it has been necessary to provide new services and programmes.  Offices established under this model are structured within the existing framework of the Department, thus avoiding the substantial levels of set up and running costs that would be incurred under traditional systems and structures. In fact, these offices have to use the Departments existing Financial Shared Services, Corporate Services, Human Resource and Information Technology Services, thus freeing up the offices to concentrate on their core functions in a more cost effective way. Executive Offices established in this manner include Cosc, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, the Office for Internet Safety, and the Victims of Crime Office.Rationalisation of other offices has also been undertaken by my Department over the course of the last year. The Irish Film Classification Office has taken over administrative responsibility for the Censorship of Publications Board; the functions of the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism have been absorbed into the Office of the Minister for Integration. The National Crime Council has been disbanded pending alternative mechanisms being put in place following a review of the arrangements for the development of policy and analysis in respect of crime issues.The deployment of staffing resources is continually kept under review to ensure that maximum efficiency is derived from the resources available across the Justice Sector. During 2009, the moratorium on recruitment and schemes introduced by the Government have contributed to an overall reduction of over 200 staff between my Department, the Property Registration Authority and the Courts Service, which were the specific focus of staffing reductions in the McCarthy Report.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	862	As outlined in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 2 of the 10th December 2009, the recommendations contained in the Special Group Report (McCarthy) have been taken into account in the budget negotiations for 2010 for the Justice Sector. In common with all Departments, there will be reductions in payroll related provisions in 2010 to take account of the reductions in payroll rates, final figures for which will be published in the REV early next year.  In addition, budgets have been reduced and reprioritised across a range of programme subheads to deliver the level of savings required by Government, a number of which are in line with the recommendations of the Special Group Report.Decisions in respect of the Report's many other recommendations, and, indeed, proposals from other sources and interested parties are a matter for consideration by Government in due course.  I have stated previously that I would find alternative savings rather than implement the Report's recommendation on closing rural Garda stations. That remains the position.

However, since the Government decision last April appointing a reduced number of Ministers of State, there has not been a separate office-holder with responsibility for the Office.  The Government appointed Deputy John Curran as Minister of State at my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with special responsibility for integration in addition to his responsibility for community affairs and drugs.  A provision of €5.465 million is included in Subhead E.8 of my Department's Estimate for 2010 in respect of the Office of the Minister for Integration.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	865	When I received the report last July, I immediately sent it to the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Since then, I have discussed the matter at length with the Commissioner.  A number of the perpetrators discussed in the report have already been brought to justice, proceedings are pending against others and a number of investigations are ongoing.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that pursuing the perpetrators, whenever the abuse occurred, is an absolute priority for An Garda Síochána.Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney has been appointed to examine the report's findings relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both Church and State authorities, to carry out such investigations and inquiries as he deems appropriate and to make a report to him with his recommendations.  The Commissioner will then consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions as to what issues arise in the context of criminal liability.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Assistant Commissioner has commenced his examination of the report but that it is at this stage too early to give a precise date for its completion.  The Commissioner has directed that the investigation be concluded as early as possible.The findings of the Commission's report are positive with regard to the current Garda arrangements for dealing with such allegations.  Nevertheless, after consulting with the Garda Commissioner, I have asked the Garda Inspectorate to review the Garda handling of allegations of child sexual abuse.  The Government earlier this year requested the Commission of Investigation to extend its work to deal with the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne because of concerns which had arisen in relation to that diocese.  I believe that the work of the Commission in relation to the Archdiocese of Dublin and its forthcoming report on the Diocese of Cloyne will serve the primary purpose of establishing how child sexual abuse cases were dealt with by the Church and State authorities so that lessons can be learned and remedies introduced.I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, that the audit currently being carried out by the Health Service Executive in relation to the dioceses will be concluded shortly.  In addition, work is well under way on preparing legislation to provide a statutory framework for the sharing of soft information.  The Office of the Minister of State for Children and Youth Affairs is preparing Heads of a Bill in consultation with my Department,  An Garda Síochána and the HSE.  The findings of the Commission's report about collection and sharing of information will be taken fully into account in the process which will be completed in the very near future.

I have two Special Advisers, one focusing on policy, one focusing on press.  The current salary scale applicable to both advisers is that of Principal Officer: €86,168-€106,582.  These salaries are subject to the Public Sector Pensions Levy.  In addition, their salaries will be subject to the public service pay reductions announced in last week's Budget which will take effect from 1 January 2010.  Payments not exceeding 11% of salary are paid to both advisers in respect of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).I am satisfied that the two Special Advisers, whose remit covers a broad spectrum across the Justice and Equality sectors, represent full value for money for the services they provide.  The practice of appointing advisers is decades old and has been advanced by all parties when in Government.  Indeed, when the Deputy's Party were last in Government a far greater number of Advisers and Programme Managers were employed to advise Ministers on Justice and Equality matters.  Finally, the overall staffing of my Private and Constituency Offices, including the two Special Advisers, remains within the relevant guidelines set down by the Department of Finance and in the Cabinet Handbook.

Such documents include those setting out public policy proposals, annual reports, audited accounts or financial statements, and statements of strategy required to be prepared under section 5 of the Public Service Management Act 1997.  The costs of translating documents into Irish are met from my Department's Administrative Budget and cannot readily be distinguished from the cost of providing administrative services generally.The available information indicates that in the period in question, my Department published its Annual Reports for 2007 and 2008 and incurred translation costs of €3,212 and €4,247 respectively. During the same period my Department also incurred translation costs of €3,538 in respect of my Department's Strategy Statement 2008-2010 and €2,175 in respect of the Ist Progress Report on the Agreed Programme for Government 2007-2112.  I can also inform the Deputy that while my Department does engage outside translators on occasion, as much translation work as possible is undertaken by an in-house translator and other staff members who are proficient in Irish.  Examples of documents translated by Departmental staff include Rules of Court, Statutory Instruments, forms, website pages, letters etc.

Agreement has been reached with the Department of Defence to acquire about 160 acres at Kilworth, County Cork for the new prison development and Government approval for the transfer of the land has also been obtained. A preliminary site suitability report has confirmed that there are no significant constraints to the development of this site and in accordance with Department of Finance Capital Appraisal Guidelines a preliminary outline case has been completed and approved by the Prisons Authority Interim Board.The Irish Prison Service estimates that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450 spaces, 400 male and 50 female. These figures will be reviewed as the project progresses to detailed design stage and in light of prisoner population surveys.  The next step in the appraisal process is the preparation of a detailed business case for the project which will examine the various procurement options including the Public Private Partnership option.  The advice of the NDFA will be sought in relation to these issues in due course.

Against that background it is regrettable that the Deputy's Party has actively opposed legislative proposals to tackle gang land crime and tighten gun-controls.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were in total 86 cases of murder in which a firearm was used from 2006 to 2008 and in 2009 up to 6 December.Our criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent years.  Many of these changes are targeted at fighting gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide ranging reforms to strengthen the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle serious crime.  The bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  I have also secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.A significant further strengthening of the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations took place with the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  Other significant pieces of legislation introduced to target organised crime include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.A further important development, which is currently being progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 which gives effect to the measures contained in the Justice for Victims Initiative.  The Bill provides for reform of the law on victim impact statements and proposes to end the ban on retrying people who have been acquitted in specified circumstances.  I expect that the Criminal Justice (Forensic Sampling and Evidence) Bill, which will provide for the establishment and operation of a DNA database, will be published in the very near future.Under Operation Anvil, up to 29 November, 2009, over 2,800 firearms have been recovered. There have also been over 8,700 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary and over 83,700 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods. An Garda Síochána will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly through Operation Anvil.

The Garda Commissioner last year made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently I introduced legislation which was enacted as the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda Síochána has been given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords have been banned from importation and sale, though exceptions have been made for collectors and martial artists.Last February, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda Síochána to inform and educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime. The campaign is targeting a young male audience with messages delivered through role models in both the sporting and media world and incorporating a series of local roadshow events as well a dedicated website and a presence on social networking sites.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table contains the number of murder and manslaughter offences involving the use of a knife recorded for the years 2006 to 2008 and in 2009 up to 13 December.YearNumber2009*19200812200733200624*Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.

Section 15A of the Act provides that the Minister may grant a certificate of naturalisation to the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen if, among other things, the applicant has been married to that citizen for a period of not less than three years.  On examination of the application submitted by the person concerned in December 2006, it was determined that she had not been married for three years at the date of application, therefore her application was deemed ineligible. The person in question was informed of this in a letter issued to her on 8 January, 2007.  It is open to the person concerned to lodge a new application if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	877	I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which trade union activists and human rights defenders have been treated in Colombia. Ireland, along with its EU partners, monitors the human rights situation in Colombia and raises issues including such human rights abuses with the Colombian Government through the on-going EU-Colombia dialogue on human rights and in regular contacts at political level.  At the Universal Periodic Review of Colombia's implementation of its human rights commitments, held at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in December 2008, Ireland raised a number of issues relating to human rights in Colombia. Specifically, we called on the Colombian Government to implement its existing legislation in full, sanction unsubstantiated allegations against individual activists, strengthen the protection provided to individuals and investigate and punish crimes against them.Last month, on the occasion of a visit to Colombia to present credentials, Irelands' newly appointed non-resident Ambassador to Colombia raised these issues at meetings with the Colombian Minister for Foreign Affairs and with senior officials in the Foreign Ministry. The Ambassador emphasised the importance that Ireland attaches to the protection of human rights defenders and trade union leaders and explained the considerable attention that their plight has attracted in Ireland. In the course of his visit, the Ambassador also met with representatives of Irish NGOs to hear at first hand about their concerns regarding human rights.The EU recognises that the Colombian Government is trying to restore the authority of the State in the context of significant ongoing terrorist activity in the country. The 2007-2013 EU country strategy paper for Colombia recognises that the "situation as regard human rights and democracy in Colombia is still critical" and that "the most vulnerable groups include indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians, as well as, inter alia, social leaders, trade-union leaders, journalists and human rights defenders".  We fully recognise that there is no one solution for promoting peace in Colombia and that the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict have to be tackled simultaneously. Our approach and that of the European Union is to support the Colombian Government as it emerges from decades of terrorism, and to influence that process in a manner that also results in greater respect for human rights.Ireland has made a considerable financial contribution towards the Organization of American States' monitoring of the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation process in Colombia as well as to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights' monitoring of the human rights aspects of this process.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	878	The Programme for Government is designed to be implemented across the full range of government Departments and over a series of budgets. The current budget was prepared having full regard to the Programme for Government and is designed to implement the Programme rather than to stimulate actions additional to it.  In terms of my Department's core responsibilities in implementing the Programme, they remain unchanged by the Budget. Our work in the European Union and UN continues as does our work in other priority areas.In terms of the financial resources to implement the Programme, the major programme in my Department is ODA. The published estimate for my Department protects the allocation of funding for ODA in 2010 at 0.52% of GNP. This is a significant achievement. Against the background of very difficult economic circumstances and enormous budgetary pressures, the Government has succeeded in stabilising allocations to the aid programme.  The budgetary reductions that have been made in other areas have concentrated mainly on economising on administrative costs. Actions identified in the Programme for Government will continue to be implemented and adequately resourced.

The Government is represented at the Conference by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Taoiseach will travel to Copenhagen tomorrow to head Ireland's delegation in the final stages of the negotiations for an ambitious new climate change agreement.  Earlier this week, I attended a meeting of EU Development Ministers in Copenhagen in order to underline the importance of the links between climate change and development. We held discussions with Ministers from a number of developing countries, including Ethiopia, Lesotho, Bangladesh, Ghana and Mali, focusing on ways in which the EU can support them in responding to the huge challenges of climate change.At our meeting, we explored practical ways to ensure that international development efforts are wholly coherent with the international response to climate change. We agreed on the need to further integrate climate change activities into our development programmes and, in doing so, to focus on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people and communities.The Government and our EU partners recognise that significantly increased financial resources will be required in order to support developing countries as they cope with the impact of climate change. The EU also recognises clearly that climate change financing must not undermine or jeopardise the fight against poverty. The EU is committed to paying its fair share within a new global climate change agreement. At last week's meeting of the European Council in Brussels, it was agreed that the EU and its Member States would contribute €2.4 billion annually in fast-start funding for the three years 2010 to 2012 to support the climate change needs of developing countries. The Taoiseach pledged that Ireland would contribute up to €100 million over this three-year period.The Government agrees that the financing provided must be adequate, reliable, and predictable, and that it must be delivered in a way that complements development assistance. The exact composition of Ireland's fast-start funding package will be finalised by the Government. It will include substantial new and additional funding for developing countries.

Against this background the optimum use of the available resources is essential, with strong focus on the further development of inter-agency working, as recommended in the Report.A Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator was appointed by the HSE some time ago and he chairs the NDRIC and leads the co-ordination of the overall drugs rehabilitation effort across the country.  The HSE recently announced that two further Rehabilitation Co-ordinators are to be appointed, based in Waterford and Cork.  I am heartened by this decision, which illustrates the commitment of the HSE to making real progress in this area.  Rehabilitation involves addressing the broad needs of individuals, across medical support, training and employment, education, housing, prison-related issues and family-related issues.  This broad approach is being encouraged through the work of the NDRIC, which has representatives of all relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the voluntary and community sectors.Under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, I will be meeting twice a year with a number of Ministers and various senior officials who are involved in implementing various key actions in the Strategy.  As part of that process, and underlining my emphasis on rehabilitation, I met with the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator this week and we discussed developments to date and approaches to expediting progress in the months ahead.Progress on rehabilitation will also figure prominently at the quarterly meetings of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, which I chair.  This Forum will be reviewing progress across the Strategy and will be addressing any operational difficulties and blockages that arise.  I am satisfied that there is a strong commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group's Report and that the structures we now have in place will facilitate significant progress in the coming years.

Both have a community development element and both have been delivered through separate local structures.  As I outlined previously to the House, for some time now my Department has been aware of the need to redesign and streamline these two programmes.  I believe that a focused programme with a single integrated delivery structure is needed in order to maximise their impact.  The two existing programmes come to an end on 31 December 2009 and will be replaced by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDP/LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  From 2010, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures, leading to significant administrative savings and impact efficiencies.

Accordingly, expenditure on translation, as required, to facilitate the delivery of this commitment to the principles of Quality Customer Service, is met, and will continue to be met, from our normal administrative budget.The Deputy will be aware that Irish is the normal business language in a number of my Department's Divisions. Given the large number of reports, documents and internal memos that would have been produced in Irish, or translated into Irish, during the period in question, it is not possible to readily identify and separate out all documents referred to by the Deputy. Furthermore, it is not feasible to separately identify those documents which incurred a translation cost as many staff in my Department are in a position to provide Irish and English translation services, as required, at no extra cost.The compilation and collation of the detailed information sought in the Question would require a considerable amount of research, which I do not consider feasible or justified in the circumstances. If, however, the Deputy has any specific query relating to a particular document or documents, I would be glad to seek to provide him with relevant information if he wishes to provide the necessary details.  In the meantime, I can confirm that the total amount spent on translation (including translations to and from Irish and English) since 14 June 2007, when the 30th Dáil commenced, was approximately €123,000.

The Renewed Programme for Government has identified the need to continue to invest in disadvantaged rural communities through CLÁR, and it will do this by focussing on priority local needs in targeted CLÁR areas. The Programme has constantly sought to address the new challenges faced by small rural communities and it has been continuously refocused to deal with the most urgent infrastructural deficits. This approach will continue to inform my delivery of the CLÁR Programme.Following an independent evaluation of the RAPID programme in 2006, it was recommended that in order to further develop and enhance it, it should be focussed on seven Strategic Themes: Community Safety and Anti-Social Behaviour, Family Support, Youth Support, Physical Environment, Education, Health and Employment/Training. This recommendation has been pursued and the strategic themes have been established across RAPID areas.  Separately, in order to ensure the continued relevance of the Programme and the designated RAPID areas, I commissioned, through POBAL, a study to develop/update small area deprivation indices based on an analysis of the most recent census data.As a result of this work, five provincial towns have been designated as new RAPID areas (Ballina, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Mullingar and Rathkeale). Minor adjustments to the boundaries of a number of existing RAPID areas were also recommended and this work is ongoing.  I hope to have the process completed early in 2010.

Overall, there will be a reduction of 11% in the funding available for drugs programmes in 2010 through my Department's Vote.  In excess of €31m is being made available to fund the activities of the Drugs Task Forces next year of which €21.06m is being allocated to the Local Drugs Task Forces and €10m to the Regional ones.Funding in relation to voluntary and community groups for drug initiatives in Co Kildare is made through the South Western Regional Drug Task Force (SWRDTF). The SWRDTF has been advised of their allocation for 2010 and my Department is awaiting their funding proposals for 2010 which is due back on the 16th December.  Overall, I am satisfied that the funding being provided in 2010 by my Department will continue to facilitate the delivery of valuable voluntary and community based initiatives to help address problem drug use.

Details of all these schemes can be found on my Department's website www.pobail.ie.  The issue of depopulation within our rural areas is being addressed through a range of rural development programmes and initiatives.Specifically, the CLÁR Programme targets investment in rural areas that have historically suffered population loss and has provided substantial funding towards projects to enable rural infrastructure deficits to be tackled. In the years 2002–2008, over €116.8m was spent under the Programme with related public and private expenditure in the region of €93m. The Renewed Programme for Government has identified the need to continue to invest in disadvantaged rural communities through CLÁR, and it will do this by focussing on priority local needs in targeted CLÁR areas.In addition, the Deputy will be aware that Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2007-13 represents a substantial investment in our rural areas. This Programme is providing funding of €425m, which is 55% co-funded by the EU, towards improving the quality of life in rural areas and diversifying the rural economy. This investment is being rolled out through the network of local development companies who are implementing the various measures under the Programme.

While the overall cut of 14% across the Developing Communities subheads of my Department's Vote will have an impact, my Department will be endeavouring to protect front-line services as far as possible. Every saving that can be made from cutting down on overheads will be pursued so that the comprehensive services that have been developed in partnership with communities over the years can be retained.The 2010 allocation will facilitate continued support for communities through local and community development programmes, supports for volunteering, supports for locally-based community and voluntary groups, the Community Services Programme, Community Supports for Older People and other measures. Every effort will be made to direct resources in a targeted and effective manner so as to ensure maximum impact in all priority areas.

The principle resources available to RAPID areas are those provided through the budgets of the Departments and agencies involved in service delivery.  The Garda resources provided to local divisions focus on ways in which targeted responses can be developed and implemented in partnership with local communities and other State agencies.Over the past number of years, several innovative measures were introduced to RAPID areas in the area of community safety, for example, an anti-graffiti programme supported by the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and my own Department, which provided an anti-graffiti impact to a wide range of cities and towns.  This Programme is now closed.Another such measure is the Community based CCTV Programme. This Scheme, which is operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, provides financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  My Department co-funds this measure on a 50/50 basis. The programme provides for a development grant of up to €100,000 for the establishment of a CCTV scheme.  The grants relate to capital expenditure only — funding is not available for the operational, maintenance and/or running costs of the CCTV system. The roll-out of successful applications under this Programme is ongoing.

This includes the RAPID Programme, which specifically has a regeneration focus for disadvantage areas in both provincial towns and larger urban settings.  Details of the programmes and schemes operated by my Department, including guidelines, criteria and recipients of grant support, are available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie. All applications for funding received by my Department are assessed in line with the eligibility criteria of the relevant schemes.The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 51 designated RAPID areas nationally. Funding is provided under this programme specifically for the regeneration of these 51 RAPID areas, including funding for projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas. I should add that the programme is monitored by a National Monitoring Committee (NMC), which I chair, and an important element of each NMC meeting is the input received from the individuals and groups on the ground via the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.In addition, my Department provides funding under a number of other measures to develop and deliver a range of community responses to the needs of individual communities, some of which may be of a regenerative nature.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	905	The length of time it takes to process claims varies depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant and or his/her employer.  The average processing times for Jobseeker's Benefit have been reduced to 2 weeks in November 2009.  In the case of Jobseeker's Allowance, the need to carry out additional enquires including the assessment of means and whether the claimant satisfies the Habitual Residence Condition adds to the time it takes to process such claims. It is acknowledged that processing times for Jobseeker's Allowance in this office are too long and steps have been taken to bring them back to acceptable levels.  These include:New claims for Jobseeker's Allowance (where means or Habitual Residence Condition are not a factor) are being immediately investigated and are fast tracked for decision.An additional Social Welfare Investigator has been assigned since October 2009 to address the backlog of claims awaiting investigation and consequently improve claim processing times.A temporary office in Edenderry has been secured by the Department to schedule interviews for Jobseeker's Allowance customers and the assessment of means.Claims awaiting determination of the Habitual Residence condition have been identified and decided.The Regional Local Support Office Unit (LOSU) is providing support for the processing of Jobseeker's Benefit and Allowance claims for the Edenderry Branch Office.As of week ending 12th September 2009 there were 674 Jobseeker's Allowance and Benefit claims awaiting decision.  This has been reduced to 351 claims on 11th December 2009 which represent a 48% decrease in the number of claims awaiting decision.

Under social welfare legislation, a prosecution for a summary offence may be brought within 2 years from the date that the offence was committed; or 18 months from when sufficient evidence to justify instituting legal proceedings came into the possession of the Department.   All such cases are submitted by social welfare inspectors to the Department's Central Prosecution Service (CPS) for possible criminal proceedings.  A brief in relation to each case is forwarded by CPS to the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO) to initiate legal proceedings within the required timeframe through the District Courts.  The cases with addresses outside Dublin and county are dealt with by the relevant local state solicitors based around the country.The Courts are totally independent of the State and judges have the discretion to decide on the appropriate penalty to be applied in any case having regard to the evidence presented to them in relation to the case.  It is the offence which is the subject of the prosecution, however, some judges choose to adjourn cases to monitor the recovery of the debt arising from the fraud.   The average time to bring a case to conclusion through the courts varies.  An analysis of the 334 cases finalised in court up to the end of November 2009 found that 14 (4.2%) cases were submitted to CPS for prosecution in 2009; 137 (41%) were submitted in 2008; 78 (23.4%) were submitted in 2007; 98 (29.3%) were submitted between 2003 and 2006.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	908	The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other government departments, the specifications for a Public Service Card (PSC) under the SAFE (Standard Authentication Framework Environment) programme.  The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The PSC is to act as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and helping to authenticate individuals.  Department of Finance sanction to proceed with the PSC project was received on 23 October 2009.  The remobilisation plan for the project began immediately.It will be necessary to procure a new registration and card management functionality, to support issuing the new PSC.  Separate sanction from the Department of Finance will be required before the request for tender can issue.  The necessary development work and organisation change will mean the full implementation of the Project will not be achieved until the second half of next year.  It is anticipated that the managed service provider will be in a position to provide at that time.  The planned complete roll out is expected to take up to four years.  The Department plans to issue the cards to selected groups of its customers on a phased basis.  Following a public procurement exercise, a preferred bidder for the production and personalisation of the card was identified.  Negotiations with the preferred bidder are nearing completion and it is expected that a contract will be signed shortly.  Last week's Budget provided €7million to allow the roll out of cards to commence in 2010.

Following a recent review of the decentralisation programme, which took account of the changed economic circumstances and the deterioration in public finances, the Minister for Finance has decided to defer proceeding with permanent accommodation in Drogheda. This location will be considered as part of the overall review of the decentralisation programme in 2011.

The purpose is to facilitate access to the range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.  FÁS captures detailed data on the profile of all clients who register with FÁS.  This includes details of their education levels, qualifications, work experience and employment sought.  This information has helped inform FÁS provision, including the recent development of an expanded range of training programmes using a variety of modes of delivery (e.g. short duration courses, long duration courses, e-learning and blended learning courses, evening/part-time courses).FÁS has expanded the options available to the jobseeker to upskill and gain accreditation for re-entry into the labour market.  FÁS through the Technical Employment Support Grant, which has been significantly expanded, funds training which is not currently directly available from FÁS.  This measure has substantially addressed demand from clients to meet their training needs.  The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) report "National Profiling of the Unemployed in Ireland" recently issued .  The objective of the report is to identify metrics other than duration of unemployment to target additional supports for people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.This comprehensive study, which also looks at international practice in the area of early intervention and profiling models, will prove very significant in targeting scarce resources at those who are furthest from the labour market.  In order to ensure the progression of the profiling initiative legislative provision for capturing profile data and for its use in selecting claimants for intervention was made in the Social Welfare Pensions Act earlier this year.  The Department is examining the process changes required for the implementation of profiling of the unemployed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	912	I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 to 267, inclusive, together.Since my appointment as Minister for Social and Family Affairs on 7th May 2008, I have appointed, on a contract basis for my term of office, one Special Advisor, Ms. Averil Power, whose current annual salary is €100,191.  This salary will be reduced as a result of the reduction in public service pay rates as announced in last week's Budget.  The Special Adviser is on call on a seven day per week basis and is not entitled to overtime.  She is a member of the superannuation scheme for non-established civil servants and is paying the pension levy.The Deputy may be interested to know that there were more than twice as many Ministerial staff in this Department in 1996.  At that time, there were 17 staff in the Minister De Rossa's office, 3 of whom were non-civil servants.  Minister De Rossa also had a policy unit with 6 staff, 5 of whom were non-civil servants.  No such unit has been put in place by any Minister since 1997.  The Department also had a Minister of State in 1996, Bernard Durkan TD, who had 13 staff.  The total staffing, therefore, was 36 in 1996, compared with 13 now.  The total number of non-civil servants was 12 at that time, compared with 3 at present.The roles and functions carried out by the Special Advisor are as set out in Section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 i.e. to assist the Minister by providing advice, by monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to my Department and by performing such other functions as may be directed by the Minister.  I am satisfied that the Special Advisor contributes to the effectiveness of the system in a manner and to an extent that fully justifies the associated costs.

All of these groups responded and indicated their wish to purchase.  However, a difficulty has arisen with one group in relation to the area involved.   As a result of this dispute a number of the sales have been deferred.

The Service is primarily provided by the Gulfstream IV and Learjet 45 aircraft, which were specifically acquired for that purpose. Until recently, the Beechcraft Super King Air 200 turbo-prop aircraft was also used as a back up aircraft for short and medium haul Ministerial Air Transport missions, in addition to its primary pilot training role. The CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft are occasionally tasked with MATS flights in exceptional circumstances and where the dedicated MATS aircraft are not available.  The information requested regarding the number of times each Minister used the Ministerial Air Transport Service to date in 2009 is presented in the tabular statement.My Department follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings:(a) The direct cost, i.e. the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services; and(b) The total cost, i.e. the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft, i.e. depreciation and personnel costsThe current rates per hour used to establish these costs in relation to Air Corps aircraft used in provision of Ministerial Air Transport Service are as follows:AircraftAverage Direct Cost Per HourAverage Total Cost Per Hour€€Gulfstream4,0507,890Learjet1,2702,950Beechcraft1,3201,770CASA1,3352,821DateReturn DateMin.

This compares to a cost of administering the service of €5.7m. The dog control services operated by local authorities include, dog wardens, dog pounds/shelters, inspections, dealing with stray dogs including collection, return, rehoming or disposal together with enforcement and related activities. As can be seen from the figures, there was a shortfall of some €2.9m nationally in operating the dog control services. My Department will shortly be introducing the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, 2009, and intends to raise the cost of dog licence fees to €20 for an individual dog licence. This will be the first time the licence fee has increased since 1998. The revenue raised will help offset the cost to local authorities of dog control services and further incentivise the collection of fees.

Two are members of the Non-contributory Scheme and two have private pensions.  The cost to the Department to date in 2009 of pension contributions to 4 Special Advisers is €26,314.The primary function of special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives.  They are also tasked with keeping me informed and advising me on a wide range of business, financial, political and media matters.  My advisers liaise with a number of other Government Departments and act as a point of contact in my office for other Ministers and their advisers.  They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.The employment of staff by my Department, including Special Advisers, is subject to my Department's compliance with an authorised staffing number set by the Department of Finance and upon which my Department reports on a monthly basis. The employment of staff is also subject to the agreed Administrative Budget provisions for staff salaries. The number and pay of Special Advisers has been determined by the Government and individual appointments have been approved by Government.

The Department's commitments in this regard are set out in its Irish Language Scheme 2009-2012 which builds on the progress made over the period of the Department's first Irish Language Scheme 2005-2008.The Department produces a broad range of documents across each of its policy areas. These documents include reports, strategy statements, policy documents, advertisements, leaflets, posters, letters, and application forms.  Since the commencement of the 30th Dáil it is estimated that in excess of 150 such documents have been translated into Irish. Some of these smaller documents (e.g. letters, application forms) have been translated internally by members of staff who have volunteered to undertake such work on an ad hoc basis. The cost of translating, and indeed the number, of such documents is not always available.  The table appended here sets out the cost of translating into Irish reports, policy documents and strategy statements produced since June 2007.

The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retrofitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.  A list of eligible measures and fixed grant rates is set out in the following table:MeasureFixed grant rate€Roof Insulation250Cavity Wall Insulation400Internal Wall Insulation2,500External Wall Insulation4,000High Efficiency Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade700Heating Controls Upgrade Only500Building Energy Rating Assessment200Further information is available by contacting 1850 927000.  For households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of fuel allowance, invalidity or disability benefit, the Warmer Homes Scheme managed by SEI will install cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, a boiler lagging jacket, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a token cost.Some €20 million has been made available to the WHS in 2009.  This represents a very substantial increase on previous years and the WHS is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes this year, with a further significant expansion of the scheme planned for 2010.  Further information on the Warmer Homes Scheme is available by calling 1800-250204, by emailing warmerhomes@sei.ie or at:www.sei.ie/Grants/Warmer_Homes_Scheme.  My colleague, John Gormley T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, also operates a Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, which is delivered through local authorities.  Grants of up to €10,500 are available for structural repairs including minor roof repairs to the homes of older people.The Government also recognises that the effective communication of energy saving information and advice to the elderly and other vulnerable customers is crucial.  The updated Keep Well and Warm booklet, and the associated website — http://www.wellandwarm.ie — provide energy saving advice as well as information on grant schemes and other supports.  Some 132,000 copies of the booklet have been circulated this year.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	931	The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which is being implemented by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), provides grant assistance to homeowners wishing to install roof and wall insulation, highly efficient boilers and heating controls in their homes.  In order to avail of the scheme, homeowners must use a contractor registered with SEI for the Scheme.  All works carried out under the Scheme are underpinned by a comprehensive SEI Technical Specification and Code of Practice for these contractors, which ensure that works undertaken are of the highest quality, materials installed are fit for purpose and overall the investment by the homeowner and the Exchequer constitutes good value for money.The applicant in this case sought a grant for internal wall insulation which was not awarded.  The rules of the Scheme require that internal wall insulation installed must achieve a U-value of 0.27 W/m2K for external walls.  I am informed by SEI that in this case the U-value achieved was significantly below this standard and therefore could not be considered for grant aid under the Scheme.The rules of the Scheme require that the contractor must sign a declaration of works on completion.  In this, the contractor declares that all works have been done in a manner that is fully compliant with the Terms and Conditions of Contractor Registration and the Home Energy Saving Scheme Code of Practice and Standards and Specifications Guidelines.  The applicant may have recourse to the contractor on the basis of declarations made by him.  This could entail having the works brought up to the standard required, at which point SEI could reconsider the grant payment request.  As part of its quality framework and disciplinary process, SEI investigates matters of possible non-compliance with the contractor's code of conduct.

This milk quota can be returned to the successor if they become a producer within two years of the date of reversion. However, due to the length of time that it can take to grant probate, the milk quota will not be taken into the national reserve while the affairs of the estate are still being settled.

Processing of applications, including that of the person named, is at an advanced stage.  I hope to be in a position to release the 75% payment due on valid applications later this week and the remaining 25% once the last of the on-the-spot inspections for 2009 has taken place.304.Deputy Paul Connaughton asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the reason the area based payment for 2009 has not been awarded to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	938	An application under the 2009 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2009. Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced on 22 September, with payments issuing in respect of those cases cleared for payment at that stage. This application was selected for and was the subject of a ground eligibility and full Cross Compliance inspection.  The inspection is completed and the application has now been fully processed.   Payments under the Single Payment Scheme have issued with payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme due to issue shortly.

Under the Scheme, farmers are required to demonstrate that the fodder was damaged and the extent of that damage and to this end all applications under the scheme will be subject to an inspection. This application was issued for inspection by the Department's local staff on the 14th December 2009. Immediately the inspection has been completed the application will be processed, on the basis of the losses verified by the inspection, with a view to payment issuing without delay to the person named.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	940	The Government announcement of 8 July 2008 required that all expenditure by Departments on consultancies, advertising and public relations would be significantly reduced for the remainder of that year and by at least 50% in 2009 compared with 2008. There was no expenditure on public relations in either 2008 or 2009. The expenditure on  consultancies and advertising is set out in the table below. As a result of contracts in place which overlapped into 2009 it was not possible to reduce the expenditure on consultancies to 50% of the 2008 level. However, I am satisfied that every effort has been made to minimize expenditure on consultancies and advertising in the period in question.20082009 (To–date)€M€MConsultancies2.4131.767Advertising1.1960.429

As the matters raised are operational matters for BIM. I have asked the CEO of BIM to respond directly to the Deputy.

The Act clearly provides that the Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions and as such I have no remit as to its work programme or its strategic deployment of resources.  I have, however, asked the SFPA to reply directly to the Deputy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	943	I announced the implementation of a €2 million targeted Scheme of Aid for Damaged Fodder on 27th November 2009. This Scheme is targeted at farmers, who encountered damage to fodder (silage, hay, straw, concentrates) in areas that suffered flooding in November 2009. Under the Scheme, farmers are required to demonstrate that the fodder was damaged and the extent of that damage.Initially, the deadline for receipt of applications under the scheme was 11 December and by the deadline my Department received some 240 applications, 3 of which came from County Cork. However, as I am particularly conscious of the ongoing severe conditions still being experienced by farmers in the affected regions, I have decided to extend the closing date by one week, to 18 December, for the submission of applications for this emergency aid. There is no prospect of extending the closing date beyond the 18 December.  Payments will begin issuing later this week to those farmers who have already submitted applications and I would encourage those who have yet to do so to submit their applications immediately.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	944	I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 314 together.It is my view that the introduction of electronic identification (EID) should be on a voluntary basis for those farmers who could clearly derive benefit from the technology.  This view has not been supported at EU level and the introduction of EID for sheep must come into force on a mandatory basis on 31 December 2009 having been already deferred from 1 January 2008.It is difficult to be precise with regard to costs as this is a new initiative. It is my intention to minimise costs for producers by availing of a "slaughter derogation" which allows for the vast majority of Irish sheep to be excluded from the EID requirement.   Only those animals retained for breeding or live exports over the coming years would have to be electronically tagged and so the additional costs to farmers in any given year are being kept to a minimum.   Farmers will not be required to purchase readers since, as is the case at present, an ear tag will continue to have a number on it that is readable to the human eye so there will be minimal change to current practice.  The additional annual cost to the average farmer with a flock of 100 sheep is estimated to be approximately €30 to €40.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	945	Under Council Regulation 21/2004 as amended the implementation date for the mandatory introduction of electronic tagging (EID) of sheep is definitively set at 31 December 2009.  I have consistently sought the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis and most recently at the Agriculture Council on 20 November 2009. However, there is not sufficient support among other Member States or from the European Commission for any further changes in relation to the date for the mandatory introduction of EID. The prevailing view at EU level is that Member States should proceed with implementation.In these circumstances, we now must prepare for the introduction of EID during the course of next year. I would urge the stakeholders to engage with my officials with a view to implementing a system best suited to Irish conditions. It is my intention to minimise costs for producers by availing of a "slaughter derogation" which allows for the vast majority of Irish sheep to be excluded from the EID requirement.  Only those animals retained for breeding and live exports over the coming years will have to be electronically tagged and so the additional costs to farmers in any given year are being kept to a minimum.

Annual renewal fees of €300 are levied on each pesticide product on the Irish market.  Fees were introduced following consultation and agreement with the chemical industry. The current fee structure has remained unchanged since January 2008 and therefore is not expected to place any additional financial strain on applicants.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department. No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate referred to by the Deputy and the candidate should contact the Local Authority to ascertain the status of their application.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	958	The information requested by the Deputy is attached and has been supplied to my Department by County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  My Department acknowledges that some students are experiencing delays in the processing of their grant applications. It is understood that both local authorities and VECs, the awarding bodies for student grants, received an unprecedented number of student grant applications this year with increases in applications up by 30% in some areas. In some instances, late applications are still being received.Both VECs and local authorities are experiencing pressures due to the increased workload associated with the increased demand for the schemes, particularly in the context of the recruitment moratorium in the public sector which, in some instances, is affecting the processing of grants.  However, every effort is being made by these bodies to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.  The current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  This includes the need to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector. It is inevitable that staffing constraints on public bodies will lead to certain pressures on services.  However, these bodies, even in these challenging circumstances, are endeavouring to ensure that the work associated with the processing of grants is prioritised.Apart from the pressures associated with the volume of applications, a significant number of outstanding grant applications have not been processed in full because the applications were incomplete.  I remind students and their parents to return all necessary supporting documentation as early as possible to help the awarding bodies make prompt decisions on entitlement.  I have asked the Higher Education Authority to request institutions to be flexible in respect of the payment of the student services charge for those still awaiting a decision on their grant application.I am assessing organisational options for the processing of grant applications in the longer run with a view to streamlining operations and achieving more effective administrative efficiencies.  Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform.  In the interim, my Department is working closely with local authorities and VECs on a number of initiatives, some of which are already leading to administrative efficiencies and alleviating some of the pressures on awarding authorities.  These initiatives, which will also enhance the level of service to students, include the provision of advance payments for student grants to all awarding authorities, migration of grant payments directly to students on a phased basis by way of electronic funds transfer and improvements to the grant application process.

When the required reports have been completed for these initial areas selected the Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country. Overall primary and post-primary accommodation requirements in the area referred to will be considered in this regard.  In the meantime, my Department is satisfied that the four existing post primary schools in the area referred to by the Deputy have adequate provision between them to cater for current demand.The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.

This study indicated that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.The Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out an analysis of each of these locations, including two areas in one of the counties referred to by the Deputy in order to identify the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014/15.

I am pleased to inform the Deputies that €7.65m of additional grant support has been made available as a result of the Budget for 2010, which is in addition to the €7m that was allocated for books to DEIS schools in 2009.  My officials will be consulting with the management bodies to consider the details of how these funds will be channelled to schools having regard to the desirability of streamlining grant payments. Schools will be advised of the arrangements following this process.

This project has a band 1.1 rating and includes the provision of an enhanced community facility in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  The Stage 2a has recently been approved and the Design Team has been authorised to begin work on Stage 2(b) (Detailed Design) for submission to the Department.  Approval has also been given to the school to seek planning permission.The project is expected to proceed to tender as soon as planning permission has been obtained and the necessary tender documentation prepared. As the timeframe for securing planning permission cannot be guaranteed, it is not possible at this time to be certain as to when this project will proceed to construction. However, assuming that planning permission is granted under the normal conditions, it is intended that the project will be on site at the earliest possible date.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the circumstances information in respect of the estimated cost of the project is commercially sensitive and in line with established policy my Department does not release such information in respect of individual projects prior to a contract being in place.

Currently there are 251 major capital projects in architectural planning up to and including stage 4 — in construction. These include the 25 major projects which I announced earlier this year to commence architectural planning and 34 projects which have tendered in recent months but are not yet on-site. All of the latter are expected to commence on-site before Easter 2010.  To date, this year, 26 major capital projects have been completed. There are 26 other major capital projects which are currently under construction.  Information in respect of projects in architectural planning is available on my Department's website and will be updated periodically as the projects, including those announced by me since September 2008, enter and progress through architectural planning.

The target group of "those most in need" was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.To qualify for the Special Rate of maintenance grant, an applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of the 2009/10 academic year. In addition, total reckonable income must not exceed a specified amount, which is €22,308 in the 2008 tax year. Finally, on the operative date, 31st December 2008 for the 2009/10 academic year, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments prescribed under the scheme. The list of eligible payments is attached.  However, from September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance for all schemes and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing a PLC course will no longer be eligible for student support grants.  The cost of the student service charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met by the Exchequer on their behalf.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they meet the terms and conditions of the scheme.1.

These initiatives, which will also enhance the level of service to students, include improvements to the grant application process, the provision of advance payments for student grants to all awarding authorities, and the migration of grant payments directly to students on a phased basis by way of electronic funds transfer.In the context of the Programme of Legislative and Administrative Reform of student grants, I am assessing organisational options for the processing of grant applications in the longer run with a view to streamlining operations and achieving more effective administrative efficiencies. Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform.

Following the publication of the renewed Programme for Government my Department sought written submissions from the education partners at primary and post-primary level seeking their views on the division of the posts between the two sectors and the criteria to use to allocate the posts. The consultation process also involved a meeting with all the education partners on 19 November 2009.My Department will be advising the education partners in the coming days of the division of posts between the two sectors and will then consult with each sector on the criteria to use to allocate the posts.  All the education partners were anxious to ensure that the allocation criteria are clear and transparent and, where possible, the posts should be allocated in a manner that minimises the administrative burden for schools and the Department.

The post graduate course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995/96 academic year and has been repeated almost each year since then. The course has not as yet been incorporated as a permanent feature of primary teacher training. The decision to provide further courses is generally made on an annual basis depending on the teacher supply situation. Intake to the two most recent such courses was at a record high of 490 students.The intake into the Colleges of Education in future years will continue to be kept under review by my Department to ensure that there is an adequate supply of teachers.

Normal substitution arrangements which apply to primary schools generally to cover teacher absences will be used to cover substitution in those schools that participated in the scheme.  From the start of the 2010/11 school year, the maximum number of uncertified sick leave days allowed in the school year for teachers in primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools will be reduced to seven days.

SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I understand that a recommendation for assistive technology for the pupil in question has been received in my Department. The recommendation is being processed and my Department will be in contact with the school shortly.

The application has been assessed in accordance with published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects and assigned a band 2 rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department's website. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression the project at this time.

Planning permission was granted in November. Representatives from the VEC, the school and the design team attended a stage 2(b) briefing which was held in my Department's Offices in Tullamore on 9 December 2009. The school has now been authorised to progress to stage 2b (detailed design). The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.

The payment function is performed by the appropriate local authority following receipt of the approved rates from the VEC. My Department has made further enquiries with County Mayo VEC which has responsibility for determining the entitlements of the person in question. I am advised that the VEC, last week, provided details of the approved rate of pension and lump sum to the paying agent, Mayo County Council.  I also understand that Mayo County Council will endeavour to make payment of pension  in the earliest available payroll.

The prefabricated unit was installed in 2007 and was rented by the school authorities.  Following an assessment of the school's accommodation needs, with due regard to the quotation for the purchase of the prefab, my Department approved a grant of €52,665 to allow the school to buy out the prefab in question. The school management were given the option to utilise the grant monies to build a permanent structure in its stead. The school has appealed the level of funding provided and this appeal is currently with my Department for consideration.

This request is currently being considered and a reply will issue to the school shortly.  As the Deputy will be aware, the school's application for major capital works is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under my Department's capital budget.  The proposed building project for this school will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	998	In 2000, the School to which the Deputy refers made an application to my Department for capital funding to provide a multi-purpose room, an administration room, a Library/Resource area, a general purpose room, a storage/circulation area and ancillary facilities.  The application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 3.2 rating.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the interim, funding is available through the Temporary Accommodation Scheme in order to provide grant-aid towards the provision of additional temporary school accommodation where an absolute need is demonstrated and the need is immediate and either the rental of temporary accommodation or purchase of prefabricated accommodation is the appropriate solution.  The school in question has availed of this funding in the past and currently rents an 80m² classroom.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	999	In 2008, the School to which the Deputy refers made two applications to my Department for capital funding.  The first application, in February 2008, was for large scale capital funding to provide a classroom, a resource room, a GP room and ancillary facilities.  The application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.4 rating.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.The second application, in March 2008, was in respect of additional accommodation for a Resource room.  The application was assessed and an all in devolved grant for €60,000.00 was approved.  My Department has since learned that the school proceeded with a project involving work over and above that approved, leading to substantial additional costs.  The additional costs, inter alia, related to the provision of a All Purpose Room.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the policy of my Department to provide retrospective funding to schools for work which was carried out without prior approval.  A letter to this effect has issued to the school authority.

Under this scheme, as a first step,  €22m in ICT grants was provided to primary schools in November.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the schools referred to by him all received funding for investment in ICT.  A letter outlining the terms and conditions attached to the ICT grant scheme has also issued to the schools.  The schools received the following amounts: St. Michael's National School, Galmoy, Roll Number 1722M: €3,809.99 St. Kieran's National School, Johnstown, Roll Number 17339K: €5,228.18 Lisnafunction National School, Roll Number 16230G: €3,221.96

Funding is provided by my Department to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking by means of the ancillary services grant.  The ancillary grant will be paid to all primary schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, in March 2010.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1002	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS, was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.  The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage set out in the Education Act (1998), as: "...the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".The school to which the Deputy refers was among a number of schools that was judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August 2006.  There was no application for review received from the school in question.It is recognised that the majority of schools in Ireland may include among their pupils, children with disadvantaged backgrounds.  In general most schools are equipped to support the individual needs of children with disadvantaged backgrounds without recourse to supplementary targeted resources.  However, evidence has shown that when disadvantage levels are found in significant concentrations that schools will require additional supports to supplement their efforts to address the educational needs of all their pupils.The Deputy will be aware that  the Renewed Programme for Government provides for funding to be made available to allow schools provide grant assistance for books.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that €7.65 million of additional grant support has been made available as a result of the Budget for 2010, which is in addition to the €7 million that was allocated for books to DEIS schools in 2009.  My officials will be consulting with the management bodies to consider the details of how these funds will be channelled to schools having regard to the desirability of streamlining grant payments.  Schools will be advised of the arrangements following this process.My Department is currently preparing for the next identification process to select schools for inclusion in DEIS.  A Steering Group has been established and commenced work in January 2009 to identify the variables which best predict achievement in schools.  A comprehensive consultation process to include relevant education stakeholders will be put in place to ensure that the identification process meets the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.
