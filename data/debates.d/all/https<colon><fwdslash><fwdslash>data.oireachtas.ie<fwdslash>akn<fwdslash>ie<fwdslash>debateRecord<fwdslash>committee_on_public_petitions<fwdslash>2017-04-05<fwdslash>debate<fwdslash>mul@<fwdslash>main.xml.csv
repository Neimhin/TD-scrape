I am sure many students leave an examinations hall and have conversations in bike sheds and so forth on aspects of the paper and whether they would have been able to answer question X, Y and Z if they had been given more time. Many of us will have had similar conversations during our junior and leaving certificate days. We should laud Ms O'Sullivan for taking time to correspond with us on the issue. It will be worthwhile to have a further discussion with officials from the Department and show them that someone has taken the time to think about how this issue impacts on students. Examinations should not be shoehorned into a specific time, particularly in English where students should be allowed to demonstrate their skills in creative writing and discussing prose and poetry. It is welcome that someone corresponded with the committee on this matter.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16191	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	2	I concur with the Deputy. Once we have issued the invitation to the Department and State Examinations Commission, it may be a good idea to invite Ms O'Sullivan to appear before the committee, subject to her school schedule. We can consider that issue.

A young student has taken time to correspond with the Oireachtas to highlight flaws or an unfairness regarding the time afforded to students to complete examination papers. This would do more than many protests outside the gates of the House. It would also be a great example of the committee's role in dealing with petitioners who advocate for changes.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16191	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	4	That is agreed. It is proposed to continue our deliberations in private session.
