#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	As the funeral of Shane Geoghegan takes place this morning, I will not raise the matter of crime as a mark of respect for this much respected young man.However, I wish to mention a matter I raised last week with the Taoiseach and which is on today's Order Paper.  I refer to the HPV cervical cancer vaccination programme for young girls.  This programme was announced by the Minister for Health and Children last August.  It involves a vaccination which has clearly been shown to prevent cervical cancer and, as a consequence, saves lives.  The cost is €10 million.  Members on the Taoiseach's side, notably Deputy McDaid, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness and, at certain times, the Minister for Health and Children herself have called for cross-party agreement on the issue of health.  I do not really want to divide the House this evening on a matter in which there is incontrovertible evidence that the vaccination programme announced by the Government in August and now being withdrawn actually saves lives.  Among the cohort of young girls across the country who were to be vaccinated under this programme, a number will inevitably die of cervical cancer.The Minister for Health and Children says it is either the vaccination programme or the cervical screening programme.  It is not; it is both.  In this case, €10 million is required.  I note the drug companies have said they would defer acceptance of payment until next year, if appropriate.  The cost, therefore, would be an administrative charge of €30 per pupil.  The Government is to spend more than €10 million — the cost of the entire programme — on advisers, press sections and so on this year.  Does the Taoiseach accept that this vaccination programme actually works and that it has the capacity to save lives in years to come?  I ask him to review this matter during the course of the day, taking into consideration the very small amount of money involved and the potential to save lives in the future, so that the House does not have to divide on an issue——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	4	This matter is being dealt with during Private Members' business tonight so there will be an opportunity for all Members to put their views on the record.  Those who get the vaccine must also undergo screening.  The vaccine is not 100% effective in preventing cervical cancer.  It is important that we do not use emotional language but that we be specific.  All people who receive the vaccination must be screened.  Screening provides 95% protection against cancer development, but the vaccine does not provide that level of surety.  Thus, it is important not to suggest, as some Members seem to be, that non-provision of the vaccine puts people at risk.  The screening programme provides 95% cover, which is a far greater level of effectiveness than the vaccination itself.  It is important that those facts are stated.  The screening programme is the best option.  Other countries do not have the vaccination.  Finland and Sweden do not use it, for example, yet these countries have strong health care systems.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I repeat that this is an opportunity for the Taoiseach to achieve cross-party agreement on this issue.  There is a vaccine that actually prevents cervical cancer.  The Taoiseach's response has thrown aside the evidence in the HIQA report that at least 51 lives can be saved over the years ahead by use of this vaccination programme.  It is not a question of one or the other.  It is both — the vaccination programme and the screening programme.  The Government seems to have cast aside the fact that this programme will save lives.  It is being withdrawn by the Government on the basis of economics rather than on the basis of saving lives because it costs €10 million to administer the programme.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Deputy Ring received a response to a parliamentary question in July to the effect that €10 million will be spent this year on special advisers, press officers and support for Ministers.  We have evidence of the €8 million spent on consultancy reports.  We know that when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he sanctioned payment after payment on the famous computer programme, PPARS, for the health system.  He also paid out money for the upkeep of voting machines, on which the Government of which he was a member spent €60 million.  This amount would have allowed completion of the vaccination programme for six years.  This Government has reduced people's lives to economic statistics.  The Minister for Health and Children, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach, announced the vaccination programme with great fanfare in August and included conditions which she has now withdrawn.  Some parents will now be forced, because of their concerns, to have their children vaccinated at a cost of €500 or €600, while others will not be able to do that.  Even if it is only a matter of 5%, the Government has withdrawn a programme that we know can save lives — that HIQA states can save lives — because of its cost.This party put forward a number of propositions.  The pay freeze would bring in €400 million across the public pay sector.  Dropping another Minister of State would save €5 million or €6 million.  There are so many areas where the Government could save €10 million in the knowledge that it is not just bolstering up bloated administration or facilities for Ministers but putting in place a vaccination programme that will save lives.  That is the point.  The Taoiseach has an opportunity today to review this programme and not have every one of those Deputies on the Government side, many of whom have genuine concerns about this, forced up the steps to vote against the establishment of a vaccination programme we know can save lives.  A 12 year old in school today who would be the recipient of the vaccination programme, which we would support, will have a life to live.  Others will not.  I do not want it said that the vaccination programme that could have saved the lives of 5% of girls in this cohort, if that is what it is to be, was withdrawn by the Government.  The Government has an opportunity to admit this programme works, review this situation and Fine Gael will support the Government in what its members have been calling for — cross-party support on a health issue where we can prove, beyond voting "yay" or "nay", that lives will be saved.

We will keep this matter under review.  It is the screening programme that identifies the pre-cancerous cells and ensures cervical cancer does not take hold.  That is the issue.  I have listened to what Deputy Kenny said and it is false.  The screening programme provides the greater certainty where 95% of all cancers can be identified.  The vaccination programme will not go ahead in 2009 but is being kept under review.

It is very simple.  Girls aged 12 will either get this vaccination this year or not.  Those with the means to get it can do so privately and those who do not will be put at risk.  The announcement of this vaccination programme did not come out of thin air.  It was announced by the Minister for Health and Children and has been withdrawn by her.  There is a very simple solution — the Government can go ahead with this.  It is not impossible to find the €10 million to allow this vaccination programme to go ahead.  Finding the €10 million will not put the public finances into disarray.  It amounts to approximately €500,000 across all Departments and everybody in this House knows those kind of savings and adjustments can and are found month in, month out by Departments in respect of a range of projects.This is a political question.  This is about the Taoiseach making a political decision to allow the vaccination programme to proceed and finding the means by which to do it.  The Minister for Health and Children made the decision to announce this vaccination programme in the first place, and the decision to withdraw it.  I want to ask about the Minister.  At the weekend her party dissolved itself and she said her continuation as Minister for Health and Children is at the Taoiseach's discretion.  I respect the Minister, Deputy Harney's integrity and ability, but as Minister for Health and Children she has not been a success.  She was responsible for the establishment of the HSE to reform the health service.  That has not worked.

She was supposed to produce 200,000 additional medical cards and instead she has removed automatic entitlement to the medical card from pensioners.  She decided to withdraw this vaccination.  The Minister's big idea for providing hospital beds was to turn hospitals into businesses and have them provided by the private sector through co-location.  In 2005 she said co-location would fast-track the provision of hospital beds.  Three years later we have none of the co-located hospitals, no additional bed, not a single brick laid on brick.  On Sunday night the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness let the cat out of the bag when he said there are some issues regarding funding from the banks and the provision of the co-located hospitals is in doubt.The Taoiseach can solve the immunisation issue by making a political decision that would have agreement across the House, as Deputy Kenny has pointed out, and would relieve his backbenchers of the embarrassment and considerable personal difficulty of having to go up those steps and vote against it this evening.

Providing a national screening programme is the first step in that effort.  We are providing an extra €25 million next year to ensure that happens.  We are providing another €15 million to ensure Professor Tom Keane has the proper treatment regimes in place in the centres of excellence he has been establishing.  This is an effort to ensure many of the problems that have been highlighted in debates in the House as a result of the old system, which the Opposition seems to defend all the time, do not recur.  Deputy Harney has an excellent record as Minister for Health and Children and has been opposed every step of the way by the Opposition in respect of any reform she has brought to the health service.

We can agree, across the floor of the House, where the €10 million that is needed to proceed with the immunisation programme should come from.  I suggest that rather than coming in here tonight and pursuing its amendment and its opposition to the motion before the House, the Government should propose how the programme can proceed.  I invite the Minister for Health and Children to put such a proposal to the Fine Gael and Labour Party spokespersons on health during the course of the day.

Everybody acknowledges that they are required.  I admit there is some difference of opinion on the number of beds.  Everybody knows that additional beds are required in our hospitals.  The Government proposed to get private companies to develop private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals.  It believed that such a scheme would provide the additional beds which are needed.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, said on Sunday night that the scheme has run into a funding problem — that it is blocked, in effect.  We know it has not gone ahead for the last three years.  Can the Taoiseach tell us whether it is going ahead?  How many hospitals are to be built?  Have agreements been signed in respect of many of them?  What is the funding difficulty?  If the scheme is not going ahead, by what alternative means does the Government intend to provide the beds that are required in our hospitals?  How does it intend to ensure that unfortunate patients can get hospital beds rather than being stuck on a trolley in a corridor, with all the indignity that involves?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The HSE has indicated that it anticipates that the overall construction and commissioning period will be between 26 and 30 months in each case.  The procurement process is at an earlier stage in the cases of Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative.  A tender has been received in respect of Connolly Hospital and is under consideration.  Work is being undertaken to finalise the invitation to tender for Tallaght Hospital.  The provisions of the project agreements under which bidders entered bids are based on the principle that the State and the HSE should work together to ensure that these projects get up and running.  The HSE is involved in ongoing discussions on implementation matters.  It is supported by a steering group that comprises legal and financial experts and representatives of the Department of Health and Children.  The HSE is working with the developers at each site to facilitate the advancing of the financing of the projects in the context of Government policy on co-location and the provisions of the project agreements between the parties.  In all projects of this scale, discussions take place in line with the normal analysis banks make of all risks before they finalise loan conditions.  As the Deputy indicated, co-location is consistent with the 2001 health strategy, which stated that the "Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity".

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I did not hear much of the Taoiseach's response because of the noise in the Chamber.  I would like to ask about comments that were recently made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Hamilton.  He argued that if a 3% cut is applied across the board, as announced by the Government, it will not be possible for his office to operate.  He suggested there is no fat left in that office.  He pointed out that given the nature and sensitivity of the cases he pursues, he will not be able to fulfil his duties, in accordance with the remit given to him by the Government, if the 3% cut is implemented.  I support his decision to give explanations where prosecutions do not proceed.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that?  Has he examined the consequences of the statement by Mr. Hamilton that a 3% cut would be completely unrealistic in his office?  Is he concerned that, as a consequence, the DPP will be unable to do his duty if the Taoiseach implements the 3% payroll cut he outlined last July?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Every office, Department and agency of State must make a contribution to the necessity to cut back costs.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The DPP pointed out the policy he must deal with covers murder, manslaughter, infanticide, fatalities in the workplace and even road traffic accidents.  He hoped to extend the policy to include rape and other sexual offences by the end of next year, which I accept depends on resources.  However, he also said recent statistics on rape across 22 countries showed Ireland has the lowest rate of conviction in reported cases.  Is that not an important area for the DPP to address?  A recent EU report on the efficiency of justice, funded by the Council of Europe, found that Ireland's prosecution service has the lowest per capita expenditure of any state in Europe.  The Taoiseach proposes to cut the budget of the DPP’s office by a further 3%.  Is that feasible or fair?The DPP said the number of files forwarded to his office is increasing by approximately 5% annually.  I acknowledge the Government must consider efficiencies but a cutback of in excess of 3% is probably more realistic in sections of other Departments.  The DPP pointed out publicly as a servant of the State that there is no fat in his office and a 3% cut in his budget will result in him not being able to do his duty.  This important duty is given to him by Government, which the Taoiseach understands fully, and I would like the Taoiseach to confirm he is happy with the Government decision.  It will result in the DPP being unable to complete his duties properly.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	177	No one's job is being compromised or undermined in any way by the allocations they have received.  The 3% payroll cut is required across the public service.  People in many organisations can have a different view.  It is predictable that people working in various offices and agencies have a certain view of what their allocation should be.  The taxpayer does not have infinite resources.  We have allocated the resources, which are much higher than would have been available to the DPP's office or any other office four or five years ago when people got on with their jobs.  That is what we have to do in this situation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Yesterday, we had an exchange in the House over what is happening on our streets, the problem with crime and the need to secure convictions.  I drew attention to the fact that of the 161 gun murders in the State over the past ten years, there have been only 22 convictions.  We are all agreed that to tackle crime effectively, cases must be brought before the court and prosecuted and the people responsible put away.  There is a problem in the DPP's office.  The Taoiseach's predecessor told me in the House last April that the office had 17 unfilled vacancies, which was before the Government applied its 3% cut.  The DPP says the number of cases he is handling has increased by 6% and the Taoiseach's response is to cut his budget by 3%.  The DPP's solution is to pass cases back to the Garda for prosecution in the District Court.We, therefore, have two problems.  First, the DPP's office is under resourced and he cannot do his job effectively, which means there is a greater prospect of criminals getting away with their crimes.  Second, the DPP will ask the gardaí to spend their time sitting around the District Court waiting for cases to come up when they should be trying to detect those who committed the crimes in the first place.  Will the Taoiseach stand over that or will he do something to deal with it?  The DPP is a public servant and he has made public what is his difficulty.  He has an increased caseload and a reduced budget, with which he cannot cope.  He cannot do the job we all want him to and he says he will ask the Garda to deal with cases in the District Courts.  That is no good to anybody.  The DPP cannot to his job effectively and gardaí will be tied up hanging around court rooms waiting for cases to come up when they should be detecting crime.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	179	In 2006, the Department of Finance carried out a review of staffing in the DPP's office, arising from which 28 additional posts were approved to bring the staffing complement to 206.  The office currently has six staff vacancies.  This number will reduce to five upon the filling shortly of a vacant post in the library.  With regard to the 3% payroll expenditure cut in 2009, I am informed by the DPP's office that it will meet the reduced level by a combination of reducing support staff numbers through a proposal to locate in two rather than three premises and a range of measures such as changes in work practices and the level at which work is performed, delays in filling vacancies and tight control of overtime payments.  The office is confident it can achieve the 3% cut without having an adverse impact on front line prosecution services.We are seeking a 3% payroll cut to provide flexibilities within the overall spend in order that any Department that might have a particular problem would be able to put its case to the Department of Finance, which would decide in the context of the need to achieve the 3% cut what arrangements should be made to achieve that.  We did not introduce a staff embargo, whereby no vacancies could be filled.  This is a flexible mechanism, which insists on a 3% payroll cut in that context.  Deputy Gilmore either agrees savings are required or he does not.  Five minutes ago he told me where he would save €10 million and now he is telling me where he will spend €10 million.  It is the same old story.  The Deputy changes his argument to suit his question.  The bottom line is the payroll cuts can be implemented and that is the up to date position.  Deputy Gilmore is suggesting that the office is totally compromised as a result of seeking these savings but that is not borne out by the facts available to me.

That is not a good idea because it means that the gardaí will be tied up in the courts when they should be out detecting crime.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this should proceed, that cases currently being prosecuted by the DPP should now be handed back to the Garda for prosecution in the District Court?  Is the Taoiseach happy with that?  Will he do anything or have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform do anything to ensure that it does not happen and that we can have a situation where the gardaí are enabled to do their job without being tied up in the courts and that DPP is enabled to do his job successfully and that he can ensure his office also does successful work?That is all I want to ascertain, there is no point in blaming me for it.  I did not say it, the DPP said it.

I have explained to Deputy Gilmore that the DPP's office has come back and indicated where it will make the 3% savings.

On the response the Taoiseach has given to both Deputy Kenny and Deputy Gilmore, and to the latter more particularly on his second line of questioning, would the Taoiseach accept that what has been recorded publicly and referred to seems in direct contradiction to what he states is the most up-to-date position?  Surely at the very least if, as Deputy Gilmore indicates, there is a concern about progressing convictions and moving towards successful convictions as a result of the impact of the proposed 3% reduction in the budget for the Chief State Solicitor's office and the role of the DPP, would the Taoiseach undertake to the House to establish factually what is the position and report back to us?  Surely that is a formula that will get us out of this exchange, which will not achieve anything.  The facts should inform the decision and if they do, as Deputy Gilmore claims and refers to in terms of the words of Mr. Hamilton himself, then a problem exists and needs to be addressed.  Would the Taoiseach accept that there is a need to establish factually the situation and act responsibly as a result?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The factual situation is clear.  The only fair and transparent way in which one can achieve 3% payroll savings is to impose that obligation on everybody.  Everyone can make a case.  Within the ceiling of the overall 3% payroll savings, which are necessary and must be obtained, one can, if an area has a problem, work through the Department of Finance and the public service.  People listen to these points of view at the official level in terms of what the public services believes is required.  That is how it works.One cannot come into the House and state there is a need for payroll savings but one has a problem here and there.  Everyone can make that argument.  The bottom line is that there is no evidence, based on the supplementary information available to me, to suggest that the DPP cannot do its job because we are seeking a 3% saving in payroll costs.  That is not the case.  The assertions are being made here but it is not the case based on the information available to me, nor should it be.  Why should it be so?  It should not arise when trying to make efficiencies to the tune of 3% of payroll costs.

He himself seems to dispense a good deal of it.I want to remind the Taoiseach of what he has just stated.  He said that the position of the DPP and the efficacy of his office is not being undermined by the Government decision to effect a 3% payroll cut in his office.The Taoiseach said assertions are being made here.  There are no assertions being made by myself or by Deputy Gilmore.  We are merely stating what the DPP, a respected officer of the State, stated on the national airwaves, that if the Government goes ahead and implements a 3% cut in costs in his office he will not be able to do his job.  Does the Taoiseach accept that or does he not?

There are vacancies in the DPP's office.  The Taoiseach mentioned that one vacancy will be filled but that a 3% cut in payroll costs will be implemented.We do not have much contact with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  He is a respected officer of the State with a responsible job to do.  He has said on the national airwaves that he will not be able to do his job properly if the Government fully implements the proposed cut in payroll costs.  Does the Taoiseach accept the word of the DPP?

It would be interesting to hear from the Taoiseach what is the date of his latest information from the DPP.  The DPP explained it, stating that three years ago the Garda Síochána Act 2005 transferred prosecution functions of the Garda to the DPP and the idea was that it would free up the gardaí to catch criminals.  Everybody knew this.  In District Court cases gardaí could often be hanging around and waiting for a relatively small case to come up while among themselves lawyers arranged postponements and adjournments.  The gardaí could have been out doing their job.  This was the problem and the job was given to the DPP.  The DPP is now stating that because of the 3% cut he must hand back these prosecution cases to the Garda.  The Taoiseach should answer Deputy Kenny's question on what is his latest information from the DPP.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the DPP will not hand back to the Garda Síochána prosecution cases in the District Courts?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I cannot say what are the operational matters on a day to day basis in the DPP's office.

The most up to date information as of yesterday is that it will do so.

This is its contribution in a fair and transparent way as to how its office will assist in ensuring we have a 3% payroll cut throughout the public service.  There is not much more about it.  This is the information.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	259	We know this.  If the Office of the DPP is told it must cut its payroll costs by 3% then it must do so and there is no doubt about it.  Of course the DPP will tell the Taoiseach how he will do so.  I am not concerned about the accounting in the DPP's office or how it is reported to the Taoiseach or to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I am concerned about the consequence in terms of the delivery of a service to the public.The DPP states he will achieve a 3% saving but the consequences will be that gardaí who should be out patrolling the streets and detecting crime will be sitting in courtrooms prosecuting District Court cases which would otherwise be done by the DPP's office.  The DPP stated this.  I did not invent this.  It is not the Opposition trying to get one over on the Taoiseach.  We are not trying to get to the Taoiseach.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I have explained the same thing two or three times.

This is what concerns members of the public.  The DPP states he must hand over cases to the Garda for prosecution in the District Court.  Will this happen?  This is not a matter of something being an operational issue for the DPP which the Taoiseach cannot answer.  It is a matter of public policy and the best use of the State's resources.  I submit it is not best use of the State's resources to have gardaí tied up in the courts when they should be out patrolling the streets.

They go back onto the streets, prosecute again and return to the court.  Deputy Gilmore suggests they should not be in the courts but out on the streets while at the same time asking me the level of prosecution of offences.  For an offence to be prosecuted, under our law the person who makes the arrest must go to court and make the case.  It is called due process and gardaí will continue to do this.I am not trying to get to Deputy Gilmore either.  All I am doing is giving the information prepared by another public servant in response to the queries raised.  The response is that the office is confident that it can achieve the 3% payroll cut without having an adverse impact on frontline prosecution services.

The question now has descended into which information is the most up to date.  It is a sad situation that on the day an innocent victim of gangland murder is buried, the real question is whether the DPP's office is in a position to effectively prosecute in all cases presenting and whether the proposed curtailment in terms of budget provision for 2009 will have any negative impact on this expectation.The Taoiseach has responded to the questions but I ask him to verify to the House the information as provided as clearly it seems to be in contradiction to the position articulated by Mr. Hamilton.  The Taoiseach should do so as a matter of course in his position.

We all know that gardaí must attend in court.  This morning, we had a discussion about co-location of hospitals but the Taoiseach seems to imply that gardaí should have powers of bilocation and be on the streets and in court at the same time.

I am asking a simple question.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions, a respected officer of the State, Mr. Hamilton, speaking on national radio stated he will not be able to do his job effectively if the Government implements a 3% payroll cut?  He did not make this up.  Does the Taoiseach accept his word that he has difficulties with what the Taoiseach proposes?  What is the date of the report which the Taoiseach has in front of him which states something different from what is reported?

If that was his view, that was his view.  The up to date position is as I outlined.  That is all I can state about it.  If this is an effort to get me into a row with the DPP I have no intention of going there.  We all understand the independence of his office and the issues.  I will not be brought down this cul-de-sac.

We discussed the current situation in Palestine in general and the prospects of progress towards an agreed two state solution.I travelled to New York to attend the UN high level meeting on the millennium development goals on 25 September.  I spoke on the topic of hunger at a round table discussion on food security.  During the course of my visit I launched the report of the hunger task force in the presence of the UN Secretary General.  As I mentioned in the House last week the task force on hunger report was very well received.  I was accompanied by my programme manager, my private secretary, the Government press secretary, two senior officials from my Department, and my personal protection officer.  The delegation travelled to New York on a scheduled commercial flight.I visited China from 22 to 25 October.  The purpose of my visit, in addition to attending the Asia-Europe, ASEM, summit  in Beijing, was to further strengthen bilateral and trade relations between China and Ireland and to assist with developing co-operation in new sectors, including financial services.I led a trade mission involving approximately 100 Irish businesses and organisations and participated in a business breakfast organised by Enterprise Ireland, attended by more than 500 guests, as well as events organised by IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia.  These events promoted Ireland as a source of world-class products and services.  As a result of this trade mission, contracts were signed worth €65 million over the next 12 to 18 months.  I also witnessed the signing of two important memoranda of understanding between our respective regulatory authorities in the financial services area, which will enhance opportunities in the financial services sector and facilitate greater investment in both directions.During my visit to China, I met with Premier Wen Jiabao at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.  We discussed the potential for Ireland and China to do more business together, as well as EU-China relations and the international economic and financial crisis.  I also gave a keynote speech on Ireland-China relations at the prestigious China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing.I participated in ASEM VII, the Asia-Europe summit which is held every two years to promote political, economic and cultural co-operation between Asian and European leaders and to identify common strategies to address global issues that impact on both regions.  Summit topics included discussions on the current international economic and financial situation, food security, and disaster preparedness and management.  During the summit I highlighted the global issue of world hunger and emphasised the importance of collective action in tackling hunger and its underlying causes.  I specifically referred to the key recommendations of the Government's hunger task force report — delivering on the millennium development goals, increasing agricultural productivity in Africa and action on maternal and infant malnutrition — as being highly relevant to our discussions.Regarding my travelling plans for the remainder of 2008, I will attend the European Council meeting in Brussels in December.

Is it likely that the Taoiseach will visit Washington on the traditional St. Patrick's Day business and has a formal request been submitted in that regard?  What is the up-to-date position — or the latest report, as the Taoiseach would call it — in respect of the undocumented Irish in the United States?  Are we moving to prepare a new case on that?What is the position regarding yesterday's visit by the President of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclav Klaus?  The Taoiseach has conducted himself properly on his visits abroad.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The Taoiseach's predecessor invited former United States President, Mr. Bill Clinton, and former British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, to help him in the run-in to the election campaign in 2007.  However, it is a case of embarrassment for the Government that a visiting President has made political remarks in this jurisdiction while on a state visit.  It is inappropriate and an embarrassment for the Government in the context of where we stand in Europe and our future in Europe.  The Government should have taken a far clearer view on this issue.It was within the Taoiseach's information that the President would attend a particular function.  It might have been better if he had been warned that this would be inappropriate.  Perhaps the visit should have been cancelled altogether.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on this?  Did the Department of Foreign Affairs advise the Government or was it simply a case of complacency in the knowledge that the president might well make the statements that he made, which are clearly an embarrassment to the Government and to the work it is setting out to do in respect of Ireland's future in Europe?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I have not put in a request for a meeting with the President-elect of the United States, Mr. Obama, other than to send my good wishes on his election.  He should be allowed the opportunity to settle into his new post.  He has many preparatory issues to deal with before taking office in January.  As I said last week, we should leave it at that for now.  We intend to work closely with his Administration in developing our bilateral relations with the United States, which continue to be excellent, specifically in regard to the issue of the undocumented Irish.  That is an ongoing issue.There is a new Congress and we will have to wait and see how the matter can be progressed.  It is a difficult issue in the context of domestic politics in the United States, but it is an issue on which we continue to make our case in order to assist those in the difficult situation of not having proper status in terms of how they work and live in the United States.  We had a helpful decision in regard to the visa programme and other efforts are being made to build on that.  It is early days as far as the new Administration is concerned and we must wait to determine whether there is a political will to revisit this issue and find a creative and helpful solution.Regarding the visit of the President of the Czech Republic, he is here on a state visit and I do not wish to enter into any controversy on the matter.  He has well known views, which he has consistently held, on various aspects of policy and he has articulated those here in Ireland.  I do not wish to add anything to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs had to say this morning.  We have freedom of speech and we live in a democracy.  People have views on this issue, with many of our own citizens expressing that view last May in the referendum, which we respect.  We must move on from there and see how to deal with the issues that now arise.  I do not wish to say anything that would in any way affect the cordial welcome that the President, Mr. Klaus, has received in Ireland.  I understand he is visiting Czech citizens living in Cork today.  He is welcome here and I wish him well on his return.

The issue, however, is whether he should use the occasion of an official state visit to this country to do so.  I appreciate the courtesy the Taoiseach is displaying to the Czech President, which does not appear to be reciprocated.  Does the Government intend to raise the issue in any form with the Government of the Czech Republic?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The Taoiseach gave a reply and I am entitled to ask a supplementary question.What was achieved by the Taoiseach's visit to China, which was truncated due to the domestic difficulties he was facing at home in trying to keep the Government together in the aftermath of the budget?  Did he raise with the Chinese authorities any of the human rights questions that are of concern here, such as the issue of Tibet?  Was any progress made on the possible establishment of direct air links between Ireland and China?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The visit to China achieved a lot.  It was the second largest trade delegation ever to leave the State.  The largest was also to China, in 2005.  As I said, contracts worth €65 million were signed.  I spoke to people on the trade delegation and they were very happy with the progress we are making in seeking to establish business relations with counterparts in China.  We all know the importance of the emerging Chinese market.  Ireland is displaying that the reach of Irish exports is now global, and not simply the UK, Europe and the United States.  The Middle East and Asia are important markets that are growing in importance, and Ireland is very well regarded there.Second, I attended the EU-ASEM meeting, as did many other prime ministers.  It was an important debate.  Our Asian colleagues attach great importance to the attendance of prime ministers at such a meeting.  It gives us an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with colleagues from that part of the world.  We might not do much trade with some of their countries but it is important that we show our interest and demonstrate the inter-dependence that exists between these trading blocs, particularly in the context of the worldwide financial and economic crisis, about which they are also concerned.The conclusions of that meeting were broad agreement on the need for better co-ordination and on the need, at the important meeting in Washington next week, to see how the financial architecture that underpins the world's trading system, it having been established in the aftermath of the Second World War, can be updated to meet the requirements of the 21st century.  These are huge issues that require detailed, face-to-face discussions.  For that reason it was important that I and many other colleagues attended.  Almost all the EU prime ministers, with the exception of the British Prime Minister, were in attendance.On the other issue the Deputy mentioned, I do not intend to raise this matter any further beyond what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said this morning.

Would the Taoiseach employ the same language following his recent visit?  Does he have any evidence from his recent visit to express the view that he is impressed by the Chinese Government's commitment to address human rights abuses in its country?On a different matter, the Taoiseach's colleague, Deputy Chris Andrews, and my colleague, Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh, participated in an international parliamentary delegation's visit to the Gaza Strip last weekend, where they were exposed to the reality of the ongoing Israeli blockade of that part of the Palestinian territories.  Does the Taoiseach have any plans for, or will he give serious consideration to, a visit in his capacity as Taoiseach to the Palestinian territories and specifically Gaza and a meeting with Salam Fayyad, the Prime Minister of the Palestine National Assembly?  I encourage him to do so.

Will the Taoiseach consider breaking with precedent and come to the House before he goes to that meeting to outline what proposals he intends to put to his fellow prime ministers?  One of the shortcomings of this House's dealings with Europe is that the House does not have an input before such meetings.  It would be helpful to the Taoiseach and to the Irish people in general in understanding the way forward if we all had an input or were allowed to express a view before he went to the meeting, which is to be held on 13 December.  Perhaps he will consider breaking with precedent and consult the House beforehand.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	308	These matters are worthy of consideration at any time.In respect of Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, I do not have plans to visit Palestine in the immediate future.  I have been there on a number of occasions in other capacities.  The EU has a common foreign and security policy and the Presidency of the Union usually takes on the role of keeping the Union abreast of developments or, more to the point, the lack of developments in the Middle East and regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state, which we very much support.  I met President Abbas when he visited this country recently so I had the opportunity to be personally briefed on the up-to-date position.  I had also met him in his capacity as prime minister when I visited Gaza and the West Bank in the past.With regard to human rights in China, I did not make a general reference to the matter.  The meeting was primarily on an agenda on economic issues that had been set at the request of the Chinese, who were about to begin the ASEM summit.  However, I made a general reference in my reply to the importance of the development of human rights.  I believe it is only through encouragement and respectful dialogue that one can acquire a standing on this issue which might be influential in a positive way.  We will continue at all times to encourage the Chinese Government along the path upon which it has embarked in this area as in others.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	314	As has been made clear to the Chief Whip on numerous occasions, I do not favour the use of guillotines.  It may well be the case that a Bill could be talked out in the time allocated but I object to the use of the guillotine.  This is an important Bill and with unemployment increasing by 10,000 per month, it has serious implications.  There is a raft of issues relevant to social and family affairs and the social welfare Bill, including reform of different sections and schemes, which Members wish to discuss.  I object to the guillotining of the Bill at 10 p.m. and I will call for a vote if necessary.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The Labour Party does not agree to the Government's proposal to guillotine the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 at 10 p.m.  The effect of this guillotine would leave only two speaking slots available for the Labour Party, which has some 20 Members, many of whom wish to contribute to the debate.The Bill will make major changes to some social welfare provisions.  Unemployed people will lose more than €2,500 due to the changes in the jobseeker's benefit.  Parents of children aged 18 years will lose almost €2,000 due to the changes in child benefit.  Parents of children aged five years will lose approximately €800 due to the changes in the early child care supplement.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Fewer people with disabilities, injuries or illnesses will qualify for payments.  For these reasons the Labour Party seeks a longer period in which to debate the Bill.  It is clear the Government wishes to rush the Bill through and bury the changes at 10 p.m.  It is not acceptable to the Labour Party and we oppose the proposal.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I also object to the proposed guillotining of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  It is especially objectionable that a guillotine would be applied to the Bill in a year in which there has been a sizeable increase in the number of people dependent on social welfare benefits.  The figures up to August indicate some 30,000 workers from the construction industry have been placed in the unemployment queues.  A guillotine is wholly inappropriate.  Many colleagues in the House seek an opportunity to properly participate in a debate and a guillotine would prevent this.  I urge the Taoiseach to remove the guillotine, or we will have no option but to challenge the proposition.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The Order of Business was set this morning to enable a full day's debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	325	That is a matter for the committee.  It is doing some good work and a lot of discussion has taken place.  I will be guided by the committee.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	326	When will the Government publish the legislation which will take the medical card off old age pensioners?  After this week, there are 15 sittings days left in this session to complete the Social Welfare Bill, in addition to the Finance Bill and the nursing homes Bill.  The Bill which will take the medical card from pensioners will require considerable debate in the House, so I would like to know when it will be published.Second, arising from questions yesterday, it would appear that the only legislative initiative which the Government is now contemplating to deal with gangland crime, including murders, as we have seen happening in Limerick, is the Government's response to the Garda Surveillance Bill, which was published by Deputy Rabbitte on behalf of the Labour Party.  Is the Government accepting Deputy Rabbitte's Bill and, if so, can we have it dealt with in the House?  Or is it introducing its own version of that Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The Government will introduce its own Bill.  Whilst I respect the fact that Deputy Rabbitte has put forward a Bill for consideration, which can be taken in Private Members' time if the Labour Party so wishes, we would not agree with aspects of it.  I understand there is a provision for freedom of information in the Bill that Deputy Rabbitte has prepared, and there are other things with which I would not be in agreement.  While I understand the motivation behind that idea, it would be fraught with operational difficulties.The covert surveillance Bill has been in preparation in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for some time.  It has yet to be completed, considered by the Government and brought before this House.  It was important yesterday, however, to bring to the attention of the House that the legislation is in preparation.  Much important legislation has been passed, including the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007, which has proven to be good and effective.  We will keep all these matters under review and will be guided by the Garda Commissioner were he to advise us of the necessity for changes to other aspects of the law.  That is not the case at the moment, however, although we do keep these matters under review.

It was discussed in this House many years ago and its introduction was promised.  As yet, however, that has not happened.  Gardaí are spending time collecting fines.

When will we see that legislation?  There seems to be a difficulty in getting legislation to debate.  The Coroners Bill 2007 is currently before the Seanad on Committee Stage.  It has been there for nearly 12 months, so is there any light at the end of the tunnel concerning that legislation?

Will the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, be given powers, with teeth, to enforce that legislation?  Or is it the case — because it says in a written reply that it is not possible to indicate at this stage — that the Taoiseach, who chose this morning to ignore HIQA's recommendation and figures, will not proceed with the legislation?

People who live in such accommodation cannot find anybody to whom they can make the required payments.  There is a lean on their title which they cannot clear and therefore they cannot sell their homes when necessary.  The situation is a mess.  I understand that the legislative committee met recently and the Taoiseach promised he would examine the matter urgently.  I understand the complexity of the issue, as the Taoiseach has regularly told us.  The Taoiseach also said he would consider whether to introduce one Bill or three Bills.  Perhaps he could let us know if the legislative committee has provided some information on that.

I understand the reason behind that Bill is a commitment to the unions which are concerned that the JLC and REA system may not be constitutional.  The Bill is therefore designed to underpin the legality of those systems.  There is also an equal concern by employers, particularly hotels and others in the catering industry, who are closing on Sundays because of their requirement to pay double the minimum wage, in respect of which they claim an inability to pay under those terms.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I wish to share time with Deputies Upton and Morgan.I thank the Minister for dealing with a matter regarding the social welfare office in Newbridge.  The office was dealing with a backlog of eight weeks.  I raised the matter in the budget debate and I have since been informed by the Minister that three additional staff positions have been allocated and five more will be approved for October.  This will make a significant difference to dealing with the backlog which is affecting so many people in the Kildare area.  According to the letter I received from the Minister, 11,000 claims consisting of 8,000 jobseeker's benefit claims and 2,000 one-parent family payments are currently being processed in the Newbridge office.I will argue against the budget from the perspective of the poor.  The rent subsidy will be clawed back from the payments received by an old age pensioner or a single parent.  I have no doubt that on 1 January 2009, these old age pensioners and single parents in rented accommodation will be given a new book but on the same day they will receive a cheque from the HSE which will be €5 short of the original payment they had received.  I cannot understand how the Minister thinks that those people will be able to survive on an increase of €1.50 a week, given the rise in ESB, fuel, food and clothing costs.  The Minister stated that this increase would bring these individuals in line with local authority tenants.  However, recent newspaper reports highlight the significant difference between a person in a local authority house and those in rented accommodation.  Those in rented accommodation are at the behest of landlords who in many instances use agents as a go-between.  It is practically impossible for the senior citizen or the single parent to obtain information about repairs to the house.A newspaper report last week stated that one fifth of rented accommodation inspected by the local authorities, a total of 3,000 out of 12,000, as unfit for habitation, yet the Minister states that this is acceptable.  She is not allowing for the fact that the people in rented accommodation are the poorest in the land.  Any of us canvassing in last year's election campaign or in the local election campaigns could easily identify these people because they were living in hovels.  In many instances the landlord was preparing to raze the building but leased out some of the rooms to recoup his costs.  Heating and lighting were non-existent and ventilation was very poor.  These premises were not suitable living accommodation, yet there was no recourse because many of the local authorities did not insist on these properties being upgraded to an acceptable standard.The Minister stated yesterday that she was in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I raised the matter of rented accommodation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because the local authority in County Kildare had raised the rent excessively.

The guidelines state it is important that authorities should ensure that rent increases do not absorb an excessive amount of income of tenants on low incomes dependent on social welfare payments and in particular old age pensioners.  As a general guideline it is considered that no more than a 15% increase in such pension income should be absorbed by an increase in rent.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The most alarming aspect of this social welfare Bill is its almost total disregard for those people it was meant to protect.  Everybody is hit such as the old, people with disabilities and young children.  It has no regard for the fear and vulnerability of those groups.  Where disadvantage is rife, the impact of this Bill will be felt more than anywhere else.Elderly people are, to some extent, just recovering from the shock of having their medical cards removed in another part of this budget, but I do not think the U-turn has reassured them and they are still living in fear of what might be coming down the wires at them.  They are also coming to terms with the fact that inflation is running at around 4.3% and any of the increases in this Bill are approximately in the region of 3% for most people.  While they might not make that direct connection between inflation and the increase they are being given, they certainly make the connection between the increase they are being given and the cost of food and fuel.  It is not too long ago that people were being told to shop around in order to get best value for food.  Even when replete with a bus pass, it is impossible for elderly people to hawk around from one supermarket to another.  Most of them will shop in their local convenience store where food is even more expensive.  There is a genuine element of fear among many of those people about the cost of food.  They have also been traumatised by the cost of fuel and fuel poverty has made a significant impact on them.  Just last week, three different people came to me and told me about the conditions in which they live.  They are literally afraid to turn on the heat for the winter because they are not able to meet the increased cost of fuel.  With regard to unemployment, the Minister of State should take the time to drive or perhaps be driven through my constituency, particularly Thomas Street, where he will see a very extended dole queue which is longer than has been seen in many a day.  That is just the immediate and striking effect this is having in my constituency.In the past, we have had education opportunities, which were welcome.  However, while the area I represent is one where education is highly prized, it is also one where it has been less than accessible to many people.  The drop-out rate for second level is high and access to third level is a luxury for very many parts of that constituency.  This comes at a time when doors were just beginning to open, schools were putting in a huge effort and different opportunities were being made available.  The cuts in education have had a huge impact.I link this to the fact child benefit is being removed for those over 18.  The impact of this is that people who had an aspiration to stay on at school or even to go to college will not be able to do so.  The cuts for those over 18 will amount to almost €1,000 in 2009 and approximately €2,000 in 2010, and this will apply into the future.  A parent told me last week that his daughter had hoped to be able to go to college.  He is literally saving and managing every cent but because of the impact of this cut on him and his family, there is no way they will be able to send that child to college — he directly attributes it to this cut.The living alone allowance is an area that causes serious concern for older people.  The point is always made, and is absolutely true, that the value of the living alone allowance is not anything like what is needed because, as the cost for one person is significantly greater than half of what it costs a couple to live, the benefit is significantly reduced.  The allowance has not increased in line with inflation, or in line with anything, since 1996.  I have already referred to heating as a huge issue for people living alone because, in terms of spreading the budget, it is effectively twice what it would have been if they were living with somebody else.The Bill has nothing on back to education initiatives, no improvement in the status of lone parents and no strategy for carers.  The Labour Party will oppose the Bill for two reasons — because of what is in it, and what is omitted from it.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I thank Deputies Upton and Wall, and the Labour Party, for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to address Second Stage of the social welfare Bill.  The Bill amounts to a serious attack on the income and welfare of some of the most vulnerable groups in society and, unless it is substantially amended, Sinn Féin will vote against it.  It highlights the Government's disconnect from the needs of the people of this island and its bankruptcy of ideas on how to deal with the shortfall in the public finances and the downturn in the economy.The Minister has made a decision through this Bill that she will target our welfare support for vulnerable groups in society regardless of the consequences.  The Bill is mean-spirited.  The latest CSO data has shown we have already reached 250,000 in the number signing on the live register.  All indications are that the unemployment rate will increase over the next 12 months.  As people are losing their jobs, they need adequate protection but, rather than protecting vulnerable families, the Government has decided to exclude them.The doubling of the required number of PRSI contributions from 52 to 104 for the jobseeker's allowance is very disappointing.  This will prevent a large number of people over the next 12 months from availing of welfare at a time when they need it most.  This targeting of mainly younger people and workers who recently joined the workforce is unnecessary and will compound the difficulties these people face when they are let go.  The Minister has provided no alternative for these younger people so they can move into other areas of work.  This is simply a knee-jerk reaction to the shortfall in public finances.  There is no plan here to help young people who will have to cope with unemployment.  The restriction will simply leave them exposed to utter hardship.Another extremely disappointing aspect of the Bill is the targeting of child welfare.  The Bill gives no increase in the main income supports for families in the child benefit scheme and the early child care supplement.  As inflation is currently at 4.3%, this decision devalues child welfare.  It is, of course, an effective cut.  What is even worse is that there are cutbacks in both the child benefit and early child care supplement which will exclude families dependent on this welfare.  The changes in eligibility in the early child care supplement, which affect five and a half to six year olds, will lead to a loss in income for struggling parents of up to €550.The Bill proposes to shut out parents of 18 year olds from child care benefit.  This is a particularly crude measure in light of the financial burden on parents of older children.  Raising older children is estimated to cost between 20% and 80% more than raising younger children.  At a time when we have rising food and energy costs for families, the Minister proposes to remove up to €1,000 per annum from the income of families with children aged 18 years.  Many of these are teenagers in low income families who are still in second level education and, at 18, will rely on child care benefit while they are doing the leaving certificate.  Removing the child care benefit will place these teenagers in an impossible position and will force at least some to drop out of school.  This is at a time when young people need qualifications such as the leaving certificate more than ever.  The compensation up to the end of 2010 will be of little comfort to those who will be excluded from child benefit.  It does not go anywhere near meeting the loss of income families in this position will experience.Another cutback for low income families with children in education is the removal of funding under the school books scheme for the children of low income families attending non-DEIS schools.  This has been estimated to cost between €15 and €55 per child.  It beggars belief that a former Minister for Education and Science could preside over a cutback which will effectively make access to education far more difficult for low income families.  In total, these cutbacks in child welfare will result in losses of between 20% and 50% in the value of child care supports for welfare-dependent children in these age groups.  This in itself shows the insincerity of the Minister when she claims to be protecting the most vulnerable in society.Another scandalous aspect of the Bill is the restriction in eligibility for illness benefit.  Again, by simply doubling the amount of qualifying contributions, the Minister is placing the lives of people with disabilities, injuries or illnesses in jeopardy.  These people may have no alternative source of income and it will of course expose them to poverty.Not only has the Bill excluded people from welfare protection, it has done nothing to protect those in receipt of welfare.  The increases provided in the Bill of €7 in pensions and €6.50 for people of working age, the disability benefit and the carer's allowance are miserly and will not offset the soaring costs people with low incomes are experiencing at present.  In 2008, food and energy costs have more than doubled while overall inflation is running at 4.3%.  The increases for basic welfare in the Bill are inadequate and should have been raised to €15 per week.The minute gains for people through the increases in the fuel allowance were lost through the hike in the minimum contribution to the rent and mortgage supplement from €5 to €18.  In addition, more limitations have been placed on the mortgage interest supplement through caps on the amount which will be imposed by the HSE.There have also been many areas of welfare the Bill has ignored.  There is nothing in the Bill for the living alone allowance and there are no changes in the back to work allowance to make it more accessible.We have always supported the work of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  However, the proposals to amalgamate the body into the Citizens Information Board is totally unacceptable.  MABS is doing good and important work and rather than reduce its standing, it should be strengthened by putting it on a statutory footing.My party has for a number of years called for an overhaul of the social welfare system.  We believe a fairer and simpler system would ensure that people are properly protected from the downturn in the economy and that their applications for welfare could be processed more efficiently.  This can be achieved through a longer term benchmarking scheme against which the evolution of social welfare rates can be measured.  We have repeatedly asked for the removal of anomalies in social welfare that are preventing people returning to work and even from applying for welfare.We all accept we are facing difficult economic circumstances and that the current public finances require prudent spending.  We do not, however, agree on cutting back on welfare supports upon which the poorest people in society have relied.  These are unjustified and will damage the lives of the people who need support.  There are areas where the Government could have raised revenue but it chose not to.  It decided to retain tax breaks for private hospitals and to continue to protect the wealthiest in society but went for the soft targets — the elderly, children and the unemployed.The Minister's decision to strip the Combat Poverty Agency of its independent statutory status and to integrate it with the Office for Social Inclusion is nothing short of censorship.  The Combat Poverty Agency had for almost two decades highlighted the issue of poverty and the impact of State policies on people living in poverty.  The research and findings the agency brought into the public domain demonstrated the failure of successive Governments to address poverty.  Due to this independent critical voice and because the Minister wants the reality of poverty to be hidden from the public, she has decided to silence the agency.Yesterday on Question Time, the Minister was not able to state the costs attached to merging the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion.  There does not appear to be any proper plan as to how the two bodies can be integrated.  This in itself demonstrates it is not a cost-saving measure or proper reform but simply a political decision to gag the only independent body which could provide the public with high quality independent research on poverty in Ireland.The decision to revoke a body, created in primary legislation through an amendment on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is unprecedented and cynical.  The Minister made a decision some time ago that the agency would be wound up.  She could have easily expressed her decision in the Bill.  The manner in which the Combat Poverty Agency is being dealt with is nothing short of a disgrace.The Bill is dishonest, mean and targets the poor.

It is even more important in difficult times, especially in the current economic context in which unemployment is rising rapidly.  Much of this debate has been devoid of the overall budgetary and financial context.  It is important to emphasise that approximately €20 billion will be paid on social welfare next year, a 15.5% increase.  Taking account of social insurance fund expenditure, it comes to 17.7%.  There is no other substantial area of Government expenditure that is showing this type of increase.I congratulate both the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Government for protecting the social welfare system and ensuring it can continue to function in providing a safety net.  I do not perceive any cuts that are substantial, let alone savage.  There has been a flood of rhetoric from various quarters which does not stand up to any serious examination.I am proud of what the State has achieved in social welfare over the past 40 years.  In the mid-1960s the social welfare system existed but was very Spartan.  I do not wish in any sense to claim that social welfare is luxuriant today.  It is difficult to live on social welfare alone at any time.  However, there have been large improvements since the 1960s.  I am proud of what my party has been able to contribute in this area.  I also acknowledge the contribution of Opposition parties when in Government.  Former Deputies, such as the late Frank Cluskey and Proinsias De Rossa, come to mind.  Proinsias De Rossa began the increase in child benefit in the mid-1990s which has been carried on and greatly amplified under Fianna Fáil.The social welfare increases of between 3% and 3.8% are well above the predicted inflation rate for next year.  There are different measures of inflation which range from 2% to 2.5%.  All Members know that prices in many areas are falling sharply.  Living standards are, by and large, being protected.  We must also keep at the back of our minds the fact that there is a serious global financial and economic situation.  Next year's State borrowing, equivalent to 6.5% of GDP, is the limit to what is prudent.  The European Commission is querying that figure which, in all probability, will be the highest borrowing level of any EU member state.Inevitably, there has to be some trimming in certain areas of expenditure.  I am glad, however, we have been able to give pensioners an extra €7 per week.  In an ideal world, there would be no trimming.  We have shown in the past several years what we can do when the resources are available.  I recall in the mid-1980s a former Minister for Finance warned that social welfare recipients could not necessarily expect an increase every year.  The draft 1987 budget, before Fine Gael went out of office, stated increases would only begin in November of that year.  Even in much better times, in 1995 the increase for old age pensioners was only 2.5%.  In this context, I believe we have done well.  As the Minister pointed out, the lowest social welfare payments are now over €200.The child dependant payment, stopped for over ten years, has been resumed.  In 1996 a Government study argued the payment was increasing the poverty trap.  Circumstances have changed since and, therefore, the policy.  Child benefit and the early child allowance have only been trimmed at the edges.  The majority of children are now in school by the age of five and a half years.  The burden of child care payments for small children should have eased off at that point.  Extending child benefit beyond the age of 18 years might have been desirable.  It will be continued in a transitional way for those on the lowest incomes.  That is something we perhaps cannot afford in the current circumstances.  Undoubtedly there is a tightening in the system and individuals and families will in specific instances be adversely affected.  However, the whole point of the budget is to protect our ability to pay for social services in the future, and if we do not address that problem we will be in deep difficulty.I was impressed by an article I saw last Saturday in The Irish Times by former Taoiseach and Deputy Garret FitzGerald, which ended by asking whether it was possible to have a serious economic and financial debate in this country.  The Opposition parties have been adopting an approach of making hay while the sun shines.  For them, cuts are savage and the young and old are being hit.  Deputy Gilmore never talks about the medical card situation except in terms of taking medical cards from old age pensioners, and he says that without any qualification whatsoever.  However, it is up to the Government to take responsibility and, if necessary, to bear unpopularity.  If the Opposition parties simply want to adopt a populist approach, so be it.  That is their right.There has been little mention of the disability payment, probably because the problem has been sorted out.  The Minister was correct to adjust the payment.  There were well-founded reasons for bringing in the change she wanted to make but there were also counter-arguments and, in the end, the counter-arguments prevailed.  Last week I launched the new edition of the Tipperary Historical Journal, which is published in the Minister’s home town of Thurles.  It contains the wonderful story of a 91-year-old veteran of the Peninsular War who fought under the Duke of Wellington.  One of the things the veteran told to the person who wrote down the story was the maxim, “A good retreat is better than a bad stand”.  That has particular relevance to this issue.The MABS system is important and valuable and will retain its identity, although in co-ordination with the Citizens Information Board.  I pay tribute to the work of the Combat Poverty Agency over the past 20 years and more.  It has made a valuable contribution to public debate.  At the same time, however, it is the job of the Government and, more particularly, the Department of Social and Family Affairs to combat poverty.  I hope the intellectual resources of the agency will be well used.  It is nonsense to say there is now no independent critic in this area.  The ESRI does great work in the area of poverty and income distribution and has often been critical of the Government.  It will continue outside the public sphere altogether, and agencies such as CORI will not lose their voices.  I do not think the fears are justified in this regard.I noted with interest figures from the OECD which show that Ireland stands in the middle among countries with regard to income distribution.  We have not done too badly.  The paradox is that the so-called gap between rich and poor, which ignores the fact that many people are middle class, narrows in recessionary times and tends to expand in good times.  Therefore, those figures will probably improve in the current circumstances.  This does not mean, of course, that real poverty will not increase at the same time.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Reading the Bill, one would be forgiven for being unaware of the extreme difficulties faced by the economy.  When one takes into account that more than 75% of funds in the recent budget went on health, education and welfare, one can see that the Government is committed to showing fairness and equity to vulnerable sections of communities throughout society.We find ourselves in changed economic circumstances compared to this time 12 months ago.  There is no doubt that tough decisions will have to be made.  As the Taoiseach recently announced, it is estimated that in 2009, 10% of the public sector bill will be paid for through borrowing.  This will have a significant effect on public finances and we must take this into consideration, as the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has just outlined.  I am pleased the Bill ensures that continued payments will be made to those who are most in need and that it targets resources at the most disadvantaged.  Targeting disadvantaged sections of society is more important now than it has ever been.  Looking at the budget, one can see the Government is committed to doing this.While there has been some alleviation of pressure due to reductions in interest rates and the decreases in the price of oil, these have not always been passed on to customers straight away.  I have advocated and will continue to advocate the passing on of these benefits to customers immediately.  The banks, particularly in recent times, have shown a great reluctance to pass on interest rate cuts to the consumer, and this must be highlighted.  Given that measures have been put in place to support the banks, they now need to step up to the plate and support the hard-pressed consumer.  However, it is important to remember that these reductions in cost, while alleviating inflationary pressures, do not always confer a direct benefit on those most in need.  I therefore take this opportunity to welcome the announcement made two weeks ago by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, that an extra payment would be made to social welfare recipients at Christmas.This Bill provides for more than €515 million in increased support for pensioners, families and job-seekers.  Spending on social welfare will grow by almost €2.6 billion to more than €19.5 billion in 2009.  Given the economic climate, this is an ambitious target.As I will not have time to examine every aspect of the Bill I will focus on three main areas: its effects on older people, families and job-seekers.  From the start of January 2009, there will be an increase of €7 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment for contributory and transition State pensions.  This will bring the new weekly rate to €230.  The State non-contributory pension is also being increased by €7 per week, bringing the new rate to €219 per week from January 2009.  This will be of direct benefit to more than 440,000 pensioners.The fuel allowance is important, as people across the country recognise that fuel for older people is a key issue.  I am pleased that the fuel allowance is increasing by €2 per week to €20 per week from January 2009, an increase of 11%.  In addition, the number of weeks covered by the allowance is to be extended by two to 32 weeks from April next year.  Critics may argue this is not enough, but it is a move in the right direction.  Not everything happens as quickly as we would like, but given the economic climate it is a very positive move in the right direction.  I hope fuel costs will continue to decrease.  The cost of this scheme is €30 million in 2009 and will affect nearly 300,000 households.  That has a significant impact on families across the country.  When loneliness and social exclusion are constant threats we must ensure the vulnerable and older people are not left behind, and this budget ensures that.Budget 2009 will provide increases for families with children in receipt of social welfare payments.  Social welfare dependent parents receive an extra €24 per week for each child on top of their basic social welfare payments through the qualified child increase.  From January 2009 this will be increased by €2 to €26 per child.  The family income supplement, FIS, paid to low-income working families will be increased by €10 per week in respect of each child, giving an average extra payment of €6 per child per week.  It is estimated that 29,000 families will benefit from FIS in 2009.  Approximately 2,000 additional families are likely to become eligible for a FIS payment.  It is vital those families most in need are targeted with increased payments.  Budget 2009 sees reforms to the child benefit system whereby the payment of child benefit to over 18 year olds will be phased out between now and 2010.  This is designed to ensure the most vulnerable and those too young to work will continue to receive payments.  The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill contains provisions to extend the number of people eligible to claim back to school clothing and footwear allowances, which I welcome.The jobseeker's allowance will be a particularly contentious issue over the coming years and the number of people signing on to the live register has increased to over 260,000 earlier this month, which is the highest figure in over ten years.  Jobs are being created every week in Ireland.  Unfortunately we do not always hear about it.  Some commentators are reluctant to mention it in case it gets in the way of the doom and gloom story some like to peddle.  Government policy is committed to continuing to attract investment and promote indigenous industries.  We had a presentation from Guaranteed Irish and it is a very cost effective scheme.  It is important that consumers and retailers highlight the need to buy Irish.I welcome the increase in social welfare expenditure of €2.6 million next year.  I also welcome the targeting of resources towards the most vulnerable in society.  We need to be prepared and realistic when planning in the future.  We must ensure the Exchequer is looked after responsibly and that future welfare support payments are there when we need them.  This Bill gets the balance right and I commend it to the House.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Deputy Crawford and I will share our time equally.  As with any downturn in any economy, in this economic climate social welfare has become so much more important.  So many people who lose their jobs will turn to the State to help them financially and in providing opportunities for them to get back into the workforce, which would be the objective of most of the population.  Last week we saw a large increase in unemployment to 260,000 people and it is expected to increase to 300,000 by the end of 2009.  That is a lot of people who had not anticipated this and do not want to be in that situation.  It is a problem for the Minister in that it will add to her expenditure and the number dependent on the Department of Social and Family Affairs.I would like to concentrate on that area, particularly those who find themselves unemployed or in a low-skill job and would like to upgrade their qualifications.  They will look to the back to education allowance for support on that.  Yet people are not entitled to the allowance unless they have been signing on for jobseeker's allowance for a year or six months in some cases.  This is a barrier to people who are in low-income jobs and a disincentive to take up a training place.  It is an insult to people whose skills are low but who wish to avail of further education to increase their skills and ability to seek alternative employment.  They must sign on and avail of social welfare payments for six or 12 months, depending on the course.  This does not make sense, particularly in an era of lifelong learning and upskilling when we have so many second and third level courses available to people who would not have benefited from such high quality education.  So many courses are available, yet we create such a barrier to them.  I would have hoped this was an opportunity for the Minister to change this scheme and help people who want to get back to work.Last week we had a discussion in this Chamber on the type of workers who are losing their jobs.  Many were in the construction sector and these young people find themselves without employment — many of them without the ability to finish a training course they started.  We should and must help these people.  In September a woman visited my clinic in Cork.  She was a mother of four young children, the youngest of whom had just started primary school.  She wanted to avail of a training course where she could develop her confidence, upskill herself and get back into the job market and seek work.  However she was prevented from doing this because she had not been signing on in the previous year.  The options were very limited.  She had not signed on before the children went to school as she was not seeking work because she wanted to be with them.  Somebody like her should be supported.  She needs the skills and confidence that would have been available to her in an education course, so she will sign on for 12 months and wait until next September.  This does not make sense.  Some 300,000 people are expected to be on the live register next year.  It would have made much more sense to support these people rather than force them to sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  That was one of the Fine Gael's pre-budget proposals and I am very disappointed the Minister has not addressed it.Deputy Chris Andrews mentioned energy poverty.  The fuel allowance has increased to €20 per week and the number of weeks in which it is paid has increased to 32 weeks.  That is welcome, but we are in an era where energy costs are soaring and it will make very little difference to people who depend on the fuel allowance for the winter months.  Most of them are elderly.  The ones that come to my mind live in poor quality accommodation that is not insulated.  They are dependent on this fuel allowance to keep them warm in the winter months.  The Commission for Energy Regulation approved a 17.5% increase in electricity costs from September 2008.  Gas is due to increase by 20%.  The regulator announced this week that there will be further increases in January.  The increase in energy prices was not matched by the increase in the fuel allowance.  Fuel poverty is a real issue in this country.  In 2004-05, people earning low incomes spent an average of 13% of their disposable incomes on energy.  The highest earners spent just 1.7% of their wages on energy.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul had to spend €3.4 million last year on supporting people who were struggling to heat their homes.  As energy costs such as gas and electricity prices increase, many people will have to turn to the society again this year to help them out in difficult times, unfortunately.I know the Minister discussed the issue of rent supplement during Question Time yesterday.  Many of us who represent people living in cities are regularly contacted by constituents who have difficulty meeting the rent requirements of their landlords.  The cap on rent supplement payments has proven to be unrealistic in many areas, particularly large urban districts.  As some one who tracks rents on various websites, I do not envisage that rents will decrease in the near future.  I pay particular attention to two-bed and three-bed units, as many of those who avail of the rent supplement scheme tend to live in such units.  Rents are not decreasing.  As the downturn in the housing sector continues, more and more people are choosing to stay in rented accommodation rather than to buy houses.  That, in turn, is ensuring that rents are remaining artificially high.  People regularly appeal the decision to award them a particular level of rent supplement.  Community welfare officers and other people working on the ground face great difficulties because they are restricted in what they can do.  I ask the Minister to work with local authorities to ensure responsibility for the rented accommodation scheme is transferred as quickly as possible.  It is a slow process.  It will be very effective because it will guarantee standards in accommodation and ensure tenants enjoy lower rent levels.Earlier this week, a report indicated that the quality of rental accommodation is quite low.  Some 20% of those who were surveyed did not believe that their accommodation met the required standards in terms of heating, lighting and ventilation.  The results of the survey were published earlier this week.  The level of inspection of rented premises is low.  We need to get to grips with this.  Local authorities need to be more reactive in terms of their responsibilities in this area.  I have always supported the rental accommodation scheme.  I would like it to be expanded and developed as soon as possible.  The rate of progress in my local area is slow.  I can see it happening, but it is not matching the requirements of those who depend on rented accommodation.  As I have run out of time, I will speak about carers at a later stage.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I welcome some aspects of this legislation.  For some reason, the economy, which was in the black to the tune of €6 billion just over two years ago, is now in the red to the tune of €15 billion.  That cannot be entirely attributed to outside economic issues.  Some people have to answer for what has happened.  I welcome the fact the social welfare budget has increased by between 15% and 17%, depending on how one interprets the figures.  That increase was necessary, unfortunately, as a result of this country's economic problems.I listened with interest to the complaint made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, to the effect that people have been taking a populist stand.  The Government has done some populist things over recent years.  It has taken out big advertisements, at massive expense to the taxpayer, to publicise matters like the introduction of medical cards.  The Minister of State said we should be realistic when we talk about medical cards.  We were told five years ago that 200,000 extra medical cards would be introduced to the system within the lifetime of the last Government.  Just 30,000 such cards were provided, however.  That is the reality.  It contrasts with the Government's populist hype.  I am glad the Government rowed back, to some extent, on the decision it initially took to abolish the automatic entitlement of people over the age of 70 to the medical card.  It got its answer on the streets from people who are not to be ignored.  I am pleased the Government also did a U-turn on the issue of disability payments.  That is important and valuable.As someone who deals with cross-Border issues, I would like to mention a letter about such an issue I received from the Department of Social and Family Affairs some time ago.  I had been trying to get child benefit and children's allowance payments to be made to the family of a man who lives in the South but works in the North.  I was told in the letter that the man in question was better off availing of the Northern Ireland child allowance and the tax benefits available to him in that jurisdiction, rather than the allowances available here.  We often hear propaganda to the effect that payments are much higher in this State than elsewhere.  When one assesses the various packages, one finds the reality is different.Like the last two speakers, I would like to mention the increase of €2 in the fuel allowance payment and the extension by two weeks in the period in which the payment is made.  While those measures are welcome, the reality on the ground is totally different.  The fuel allowance scheme does not take account of the fact that the cost of oil, electricity and gas has increased dramatically over recent times.I mentioned the living alone allowance during previous debates.  The allowance is possibly more significant in rural areas than it is anywhere else.  Deputy Clune compared the housing problems of cities with those of rural areas.  The living alone allowance is extremely important for those in rural areas.  If two people are living together on an old farm or in a village, but one of them dies or goes into a nursing home, the person who is living alone still has to keep the car on the road and heat the house.  A miserly living alone allowance of €7 is being paid to a person in such circumstances.  I appreciate a change cannot be made in this year's budget.  If the Minister is still in the Department of Social and Family Affairs this time next year, I urge her to consider increasing the living alone allowance.  I ask her to reflect on the economic realities of rural areas.  Drivers in such areas have to contend with increased petrol and car tax costs.  I appreciate that car insurance costs are not as bad as they used to be.  This issue needs to be dealt with.My colleague also referred to the social housing issue, which will become more serious in the coming year.  Local authorities have depended on builders to provide their percentage of social housing but no construction is taking place now.  The Government will have to re-examine this issue.  Building has been under way on a number of sites in my home town of Monaghan for a few years but social housing has not been provided as a priority.  When it will be provided is a different story.  As the years go by, significantly less development will be undertaken and, therefore, less housing will be provided.  The Government has the choice of buying up available housing to provide social housing for those who need it or to adjust the rental allowance scheme to make sure claimants can live in proper houses.  I met a couple recently who pay €160 per week to rent a house.  The woman has just had a baby and the man is on short-term work, yet the owner of the house would not agree to them availing of the rent supplement scheme.  This is a serious issue and it is one of many that are coming more to the fore than previously.I refer to another young couple to highlight another issue.  The young man is a non-national and he married an Irish girl three years ago.  He was only able to start work eight or nine months ago because he had to await documentation.  His job is slowly ebbing away and it is not for the want of trying.  He is working as hard as he can and his company has retained him because of his effort.  If he is made redundant at Christmas or in the new year, he will be caught in a bind because of the increase in stamp contributions from 52 to 104 to claim unemployment benefit.  Will the Minister re-examine this proposal to consider how it will affect individuals who are genuinely trying?  It is not easy for her and others from an economic point of view but we do not want people living in desperation.  This young couple has a mortgage to pay and other commitments to meet and they are under severe pressureFurther education initiatives and support from employment and training agencies are needed to get people back to work.  Contrary to what was said about job creation, the number of people signing on in Carrickmacross has increased from 500 this time last year to 1,000, yet I cannot say factories have closed down because cutbacks have been made all round.  A factory in Monaghan town employed between 230 and 250 people only a few years ago.  While it has not closed, only 15 people work there now.  The situation is dire.Farm assist is an important issue and I urge the Minister to promote that scheme in order that farmers have an opportunity to get that benefit.  Many of them in recent years have worked off the farm in the building industry and so on to supplement their incomes and they do not have that opportunity any longer.  They must be facilitated.I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Fine Gael appreciates the economic problems of the country.  In spite of what the Taoiseach and others have said, we put forward meaningful and realistic proposals to save money and to make sure money was available to address the issues I have raised.  Cuts in the social welfare budget are unfair and, unfortunately, we have no choice other than to oppose the legislation.

I have fond memories of my time representing the people of Roscommon because I gave good representation.  My grandfather came from Creggs, County Roscommon, and he moved to Longford in 1887.  Deputy Naughten is a decent man and we represented the people of Roscommon well.  I was sorry to have to leave them but, at the same time, I am delighted to represent Westmeath.I am delighted to support my friend and colleague, Deputy Hanafin, a compassionate and caring Minister.  The commitment she and her family have given to Ireland is well documented and I do not need to tell everybody about their social conscience.  I am pleased to support the legislation, which will implement a €550 million package of social welfare improvements announced in the budget.  In difficult economic circumstances, the package will bring total expenditure on social welfare in 2009 to €19.6 billion, an increase of €2.6 billion or 15.5% on the 2008 Estimates.  At a time when public expenditure must be tightly controlled, the increased provision for social welfare is a clear signal of the Government's commitment to protect the vulnerable and less well off in society.People still cannot fathom the gravity of the worldwide financial crisis and while I do not want to bring it up all the time, sadly, facts must be faced.  This is a major disaster throughout the world.  The Bill prioritises the protection of pensioners.  Increases in welfare payments, an increase in the length of the fuel allowance scheme and the rate payable and an additional allocation of €55 million to implement the fair deal nursing home scheme are among the measures included.  Significant moves have been made over the past ten years to prioritise the elderly in our communities and I am happy the Minister is continuing this good work.  The fuel allowance scheme will be extended by two weeks and the rate payable by €2 a week to €20, which will ease the burden of increasing fuel costs for many people.The Government will also enhance pensions by increasing the full personal rate of the State contributory and non-contributory pensions by €7 per week.  The State contributory pension will then be €230.30 per week and the non-contributory pension will be €219 per week.  The qualified adult allowance will also increase by €6.30 for those aged over 66 and by €4.60 for those aged under 66.  The Government is determined to target its resources at those in greatest need and universal entitlement, irrespective of means, does not target them.  However, other supports will be available for people who find themselves in difficulty.  These measures underline the Government's commitment to honour the debt we owe to a generation whose hard work laid the foundation for the economic success we enjoyed over the past few years.  Despite the difficult economic times we are experiencing, it is now more important than ever to look after the most vulnerable in our society.

Other public transport projects due to start shortly include Citywest Luas line, the Navan rail line and Dublin city centre resignalling.The adjustment in capital funding for public transport investment will not have a significant effect on the roll out of the Transport 21 public transport programme and will not result in the postponement of the start of construction of any public transport project next year.  The start and completion dates of public transport projects which have not yet commenced will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.  The commencement dates for these projects will also be influenced by the time taken for public consultation, the relevant statutory process and the procurement and contract award processes.

He is spending €70 million less on public transport in this year's budget than he did in last year's.  Clearly, something must suffer.  What are the contracts that will not proceed?  Where will be the delays?  Is it that Government policy is moving away from national roads into public transport?  It does not make sense.The Minister referred to these difficult economic circumstances.  Now is the time to build his public transport initiatives and to fast-track joining up the Luas lines.  It is not the time to cut back.

I have stated that the public transport projects currently under construction, such as the Cork-Midleton line, phase 1 of the western rail corridor and the Luas extension to the docklands, will continue on schedule.  We will complete those in 2009.  We will start the Citywest Luas line, the Navan rail line and Dublin city centre resignalling project.  That is what is committed.The projects already under way and continuing include the Cherrywood Luas line, the Kildare route project, the integrated ticketing project, the Luas capacity enhancement with two new trams, rolling stock and the intercity railcars.  The ongoing programmes include the railway safety programme, removal of speed restrictions on railways, road-crossing automation on railways, Dublin traffic management, provincial cities bus priority, park and ride and accessibility for those mobility impaired.  All of those are continuing.As I mentioned, public transport projects that will begin shortly include the Luas extension to Citywest, phase 1 of the Navan rail line from Clonsilla to Pace and the Dublin city centre resignalling.  Planning will continue on the metro north, the metro west, the Lucan Luas line, the Luas line BXD St. Stephen's Green to Liffey junction, the DART underground and electrification programme, the Maynooth rail line development, phase 2 of the Navan rail line, and phases 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor.  All are continuing.  All commitments are being met during the course of 2009.

I repeat that the Minister is spending €70 million less on public transport initiatives and new works.  Clearly, there are cutbacks, there are delays or there are contracts not being signed.  Is it perhaps that Dublin Bus will not get the buses it is expecting?  It got 100 buses so far this year and it is expecting another 100.  In the fine print of the budget there are things going on and the Minister is not being transparent and open about them here today.  I do not accept his reply.I also do not accept what the Minister stated about the role of the Ceann Comhairle.  In the priority questions to the Department, the Minister alone is the person who decides whether they are accepted or not——

Budget provision is made for them all to advance and there is no change in that regard.  If the answer does not suit the Deputy, that does not make it wrong.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	434	The primary purpose and aim of the road safety action plan is to save lives and reduce injuries on our roads, by reducing fatalities to no more than 60 fatalities per million or 252 fatalities per year.  This primary action of saving lives is supplemented by 125 other specific actions, designed to bring about the objective expressed in the primary action.The strategy is being successfully implemented.  Thankfully, we have seen a marked reduction in the number of people killed on our roads in 2007 and to date this year, despite the fact there has been a 40% increase in the number of drivers and a 70% increase in the number of vehicles on our roads over the ten years to 2007.  According to the European Road Safety Performance Index, PIN, programme, Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance.Action 83 of the strategy is for the Road Safety Authority to report to me each year on the implementation of the 126 actions in the strategy, all of which identify the lead agency responsible for implementation and a target implementation date.  Both the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I have received that report and the authority has confirmed that all actions in the strategy identified for completion in 2007 have been completed in full.  These include publication of a revised Rules of the Road, road safety awareness events, integration of RSA enforcement activity with An Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise and publication of various consultation documents, including one on compulsory training for motor cyclists.  In the coming weeks we will bring that report to the Cabinet sub-committee on road safety which is chaired by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  Subsequently, I envisage that the report will be publicly available.It is of course the case that work has already begun on other actions in the strategy which have a longer timeframe for completion, for example, the introduction of a lower blood alcohol level for drivers — action No. 76 — which will be included as part of the road traffic and transport Bill, which we hope to see published early next year.  Provisions relating to mandatory alcohol testing of drivers at collisions — action No. 75 — will also be included in that Bill.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.With regard to the road safety strategy, we have had almost 250 deaths so far this year and recently we had a couple of very bad weekends in terms of deaths and casualties.  We know each of these family tragedies costs the country approximately €3 million.  Already this year, the tragedies have cost us €750 million.  The Minister of State referred to actions completed in 2006 and 2007.  However, they were broad and general.  If he examines the specifics of 2008 he will see that he is far too complacent.  Since the role of Minister of State with responsibility for road safety was established we seem to be getting worse.Actions Nos. 72 and 73 with regard to the graduated driver licence require legislation to ensure new drivers can drive safely for the first few years.  Neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach seemed to know this a few months ago.  Action No. 26 is with regard to speed cameras and this has been an issue for the past 11 or 12 years, since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, announced the roll out of speed cameras at 600 locations.  We have allocated €10 million for it and have had a preferred bidder.  It will probably bring in approximately €40 million in income and will cost €25 million.  Where are the speed cameras and why was this not finished?  It states in the road safety strategy that it was to be finished a number of months ago.  That was the timeframe.I want to give one or two other brief examples.  Action No. 66 with regard to the code of practice for the management of roadwork sites and bad roads and bad surfaces did not happen by the third quarter.  Actions Nos. 80, 82, 116 and 121 cover a range of areas in which the Minister of State has fallen behind.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Deputy is correct to state the number of fatalities this year is 249 and each fatality is serious and this is what the strategy is about.  However, it is only fair to say that 249 is 36 less than the equivalent number last year.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	443	One is one too many.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I have stated that.  Each one is a tragedy for family and friends.  I am trying to be balanced in stating that we are having successes.  The public and the drivers are buying into the process.  Our enforcement, rules and regulations are working.  If the trend continues for this year we might have an historically low number of fatalities which would be marvellous.  Even still, 300 deaths mean 300 families who will have their Christmas destroyed by sadness.  I do not deny this.It is true that some of the items move faster than others.  Deputy Broughan mentioned action No. 72 which outlines the graduated system.

The first phase of the scheme was introduced last year with the regulations on learner drivers.  These regulations replace provisional licences with learner permits.  They require the learner drivers to be accompanied by a person with two years' experience and one must have spent six months as a learner before one can apply for the test.  Other measures are being considered on the basis of proposals submitted to us by the RSA.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	451	This is a timetable set out by Noel Brett and Gay Byrne for the Road Safety Authority.  The Minister of State is missing all of his deadlines.We do not have legislation for half of our penalty point offences and I know this matter will be raised later.  The Minister of State has refused to take a stand on blood alcohol levels.  Is he waiting until after the local elections?  Drivers are not being tested at the scenes of major crashes despite the Minister promising Public Against Road Carnage, PARC, and relatives of crash victims that the legislation would be in place this year.  He also made a promise to Deputy O'Dowd in a Private Members' debate.The Minister of State is far too complacent about a tragic situation.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I am certainly not complacent.  We are making progress.  The strategy is in place and the numbers and statistics are important.  However, let me be honest.  In five years' time I or whoever is here would be happier to report on action on the number of fatalities.  There would be no point in stating the number of fatalities has increased by 50%.

I can account fully for any small slippage.  There will be a full report on it which will be published and Deputy Broughan can see what can be achieved and what has not.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The Government recently gave its approval to the drafting of a road traffic and transport Bill, which inter alia deals with the legal blood alcohol content level for drivers.  It is hoped to have the Bill published early next year.  The introduction of a reduced blood alcohol content level for drivers will require the recalibration or replacement and subsequent recertification of the evidential breath testing, EBT, machines in Garda stations and roadside breathalysers used by the Garda.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which has responsibility for the approval, supply and testing of apparatus for indicating the presence and concentration of alcohol in breath, will arrange and carry out these functions.

It is important we keep to the timetable to reduce the blood alcohol content level which I understand is for the second half of 2009.  I welcome the new legislation.  One of the key points is that disparate views exist on how the reduction will impact on people.  At a recent conference at Croke Park, Dr. Declan Bedford presented frightening research.  He pointed out the risk of a fatal accident is four to ten times higher for drivers with blood alcohol levels between 50 mg and 79 mg compared to those with 0 mg.  The proposed reduction is welcome.  We have clear and incontrovertible proof that it is a major contributor to deaths and fatal accidents.Some countries in Europe have introduced an alcohol lock for repeat drunk driver offenders.  Does the Minister of State intend to introduce ancillary actions along with the reduction in the blood alcohol level?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I welcome the Deputy's comments.  Experts state there is no safe blood alcohol level.  Many people would disagree and state it depends on how one is affected by alcohol.  The penalties we have mean the higher the blood alcohol content level with which one is caught the higher the fine or disqualification.  This is the regulation at present.  I am not sure I understand the point about a lock.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	460	When a repeat drink driving offender gets back his or her licence a lock is placed on the car whereby if he or she has had alcohol the car will not work.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I do not think we will make announcements on that in the Bill.  The penalties and convictions in court reflect alcohol levels and previous disqualifications.

Issues are also raised with regard to people who carry passengers for a living such as taxi drivers, bus drivers and commercial drivers of HGVs.  Recent surveys done throughout Europe showed that a significant number of drivers of commercial vehicles had excessive blood alcohol levels.  Are there any other safety issues in regard to alcohol abuse that the Minister of State intends to include in the legislation to which he referred?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	463	As I said, the heads of the Bill have been agreed by the Cabinet.  There will be further discussion of the detail, but the advice from the Road Safety Authority is that the limit should be reduced to 50 milligrams for all drivers other than learner drivers, recently qualified drivers and professional drivers for whom it should be reduced to 20 milligrams.  These issues are being considered and we await the final outcome.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	464	Diesel and oil prices are not subject to price controls in the State.  These prices are determined by the international oil commodities markets and influenced by supply considerations, economic growth in the major consuming economies, exchange rate volatility, market speculation and production and refining costs.  In a market with fluctuating oil prices, there is usually a time lag between the prices quoted on international markets and prices available at the pumps.  In the case of falling oil prices, there is a time lag for the lower prices to be passed on to customers as suppliers have to sell the oil they purchased at a higher cost before reducing prices.I understand from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, that the National Consumer Agency has initiated a price survey on the costs of fuel.  The survey is intended to ascertain whether oil companies are passing on savings on oil prices internationally and whether petrol and diesel pump operators are subsequently passing those savings on to consumers in a timely manner.  I understand the agency's work in this area is well under way and that it is expected to present its report to the Tánaiste next month.  I also understand from the Minister that the Competition Authority's enforcement powers are just one of the many issues being considered as part of the ongoing review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002.The Deputy may wish to contact the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment directly for further information in regard to these matters.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Irish consumers are the most ripped-off in Europe in terms of fuel prices, including petrol, diesel and home heating oil.  The European Commission recently reported that petrol prices in this State are 11% higher than the European average, diesel prices are 20% higher and home heating oil is 13% more expensive.The Minister referred to the explanation by the wholesale and retail oil businesses that when prices go down, they cannot follow because they have purchased their oil stocks at the higher rate.  Why does this not happen in reverse?  That was the question asked by every caller to a recent episode of Joe Duffy's radio programme.  Callers referred to the outrageous prices charged throughout the State — as high as €1.29 or €1.30 per litre of petrol — at the same time as the price of oil was plunging to $60 per barrel.  Does the Minister agree there is a fundamental problem in this regard?The Minister referred me to his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, bothers to read the minutes of meetings of the Joint Committee on Transport.  If he read the minutes of a recent meeting, he would know that Mr. Bill Prasifka, the chairman of the Competition Authority, told the committee that he has no power to order a forensic study of a business such as the oil industry.  He does not have that power because everything is couched in terms of the criminal law.  If he orders an investigation, he might prejudice a criminal case.  Does the Minister agree, therefore, that the legislation underpinning the Competition Authority is fundamentally flawed?  The Minister is standing idly by as consumers are ripped off.

As an ordinary consumer, I am aware of the variations in the price of oil versus the price charged at the pumps.  The price of oil peaked on the international commodity markets last July at approximately $147 a barrel and is now trading at approximately $65.  The price at the pumps was approximately €1.43 per litre at the time of the peak in prices, reducing to €1.33 in late July and to €1.13 or €1.14 at this stage.  Therefore, there has been some movement.  As a motorist, I would be delighted to see immediate falls in prices and would certainly be displeased to see immediate increases.  However, it is a matter for the consumer.

All vehicles run on fuel and the cost of the input is of vital importance.  Is the Minister concerned by the impact on public transport providers, including taxi drivers, bus operators and so on, of the increase in fuel prices?  Is he concerned by the impact of increases on our two major airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus?  Did the Minister have any input into the imposition of the new air travel tax?  Did he give the Minister for Finance any guidance in this matter?

In particular, I was anxious to avoid increases in diesel prices in the recent budget.  The Government took my views on board in this regard and did not increase the price of diesel, because of the knock-on effects that would have for the transport sector generally.  I am concerned by increased fuel costs for airlines.

The implementation of individual national road projects and the allocation of funding to those projects, including barrier-free tolling on the M50, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, under sections 17 and 19 of the Roads Act 1993.  In addition, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007.I am informed by the NRA that toll revenue from users of the M50 more than covers the introduction and ongoing operational costs of the M50 barrier-free tolling system and also contributes to the funding of the M50 upgrade.  The NRA is satisfied that, overall, the new barrier-free tolling system is operating successfully.  Take-up on the electronic registration system, which includes electronic tags and licence plate registrations, has exceeded expectations and traffic flow has improved significantly on the route, thus making a positive contribution towards the easing of congestion for all road users.I understand from the NRA that, in common with similar such systems around the world, in the first few weeks of operation there were some initial problems with the M50 system.  These included difficulties getting through to the customer service call centre and errors where the wrong person was billed for a toll.  In recent weeks, however, the combination of the toll operator devoting more resources to the system and users becoming more familiar with the system has meant the call service centre has improved significantly and the number of billing errors has fallen substantially, with billing errors now comprising less than 0.2% of all traffic.  The NRA has assured my officials that the authority and its toll operator, eFlow, will continue to work hard to put in place measures that will progressively improve the operation of the system.

As the Minister said, he has no control over the NRA with regard to its funding but there are still up to 4,000 calls each day, down from a maximum of 12,000.  Is the Minister satisfied the NRA has put in the necessary resources to ensure it runs smoothly, so that most of its time is not taken up sending out letters at a costly rate to justify the mistakes that have occurred?  I accept that it takes time to get the system set up and that it is a good system.  However, the Minister should have control in respect of ensuring that it is implemented and that everything is working right from the beginning.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	481	When problems arose with the operation of the system and when some of the difficulties were highlighted here and in other places, I took the matter up, through the officials in the Department, with the NRA.  The NRA admitted there were difficulties but to be fair to the authority, it had made it clear initially that there would be teething problems with the system, and that was the case.  There was a particular difficulty with the service call centre due to the volume of calls and, frankly, the many abusive calls in the earlier stage.  However, that has been resolved.There is no place in the world that a system such as this has been rolled out without difficulties.  There will be ongoing misidentifications.  One will not get 100% accuracy but an inaccuracy rate of 0.2% is quite a good record.  According to the information on Toronto's Highway 407, Dubai and the systems in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia there were huge problems at the initiation of the systems but they have been ironed out.  I agree with the Deputy that the NRA should continue to give the high level of service and follow-up that is necessary.  I will try to ensure it does.It should be noted that the system has been hugely successful in terms of take-up.  In the initial stages it was anticipated that between 40,000 and 60,000 vehicles would be registered.  That has been hugely exceeded with approximately 400,000 vehicles registered in advance.  That has eased problems.

Could the Minister clarify the situation and ensure that the tags work?  I am aware that some people were caught in the port tunnel looking for change when they thought the tag system would work.  Perhaps the Minister would ask the NRA to clarify the situation.  He should also ask the NRA what costings have been made to date to ensure the system is run properly.

The compensation paid by the Exchequer to CIE in respect of these PSO services, €308.6 million in 2008, is administered through annual memoranda of understanding on service levels and targets between my Department and each of the CIE companies.  The memoranda require the submission of quarterly reports to confirm compliance with the terms of the memoranda.  These reports are subject to an independent review process.  In addition, the annual report and accounts of CIE certify that the Exchequer grants paid to CIE are deployed in accordance with EU regulations governing state aid to transport undertakings.If Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann wishes to initiate or alter a bus service the companies must give advance notice to my Department.  Where proposed services by either company are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence held by a private bus operator issued under the Road Transport Act 1932, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are required to obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before the services can be introduced.I am satisfied that the CIE companies comply generally with the terms of the MOU and with the bus licensing requirements.  Nevertheless, issues have arisen regarding competition with private sector operators in a number of areas.  In this regard, the Competition Authority, the European Commission and my Department are investigating complaints against Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  It would be premature at this stage to make determinations as to the outcome of these matters.Funding is also provided for regional air services and rural transport services.  I am satisfied that the recipients of this aid are acting within the terms of their service agreements.

However, he is not completely satisfied.  Private bus companies who were providing commuter services, such as Circle Line, have gone out of business because of what they claim to be unfair competition from Dublin Bus.  There are serious issues in this area.  One of the problems is that there is no transparency about the routes that are PSO and those that are not.  The allegation is made, and I appreciate it is being investigated by the European Commission and the Competition Authority, that State funding is being used to keep a private bus operator from operating competitive services.  That is unfair and unacceptable.

We have lived by that rule.  I do not wish to comment specifically on any case because most of them are ongoing at present.  However, I can assure the Deputy that where there is a PSO an audit is carried out on it.

Second, why are we still waiting for legislation on this matter?  There have been serious complaints from Swords Express, Circle Line, the Dublin tour bus operators and so forth to Deputies.  My colleague Deputy O'Dowd asked about PSOs.  We know, for example, that the nine o'clock bus to Finglas or the nine o'clock bus to Dundrum is the type of service that will in all probability have to be supported.  Given this fact, why does the Minister not simply publish legislation, pass it through the Houses and move on to a playing pitch that everybody understands in terms of good standards of public transport?

The Dublin Transport Authority Act allows for competition on any new PSO routes in the future.  From 1 December next year, new PSO routes will be open to competition from the private sector as well as from Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.  The legislation the Deputy asked about is the reform of the 1932 Act.  The heads of the Bill are in circulation and will go to the Government shortly.  I will bring that legislation forward as a matter of urgency.

Is the Minister prepared to publish the report?  I am a strong supporter of public transport, but why is the sector operating under an Act from 1932, at which time most of the country used bicycles and horses to get around?  The situation is laughable and it is another indictment of the Minister and the Government.

We introduced part of the required legislation, namely, the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008, with the co-operation of Opposition Members including Deputy Broughan.  We are now concentrating on amending the Road Transport Act 1932 as quickly as possible.  I expect to discuss this in the House early next year.The case involving Swords Express was settled in the High Court on 28 October 2008.  The principal element of the settlement provided for an inquiry created under section 25(2) of the Transport Act 1958 to deal with a decision to authorise rerouting of the 41X bus service in Swords.  The inquiry will produce a report which will be submitted to me for final determination and this will be pursued within a defined timeframe.  In addition, the High Court settlement allows the Department to give early consideration to outstanding applications for express bus services from Swords.  We await a submission from Digital Messenger consultants, the receipt of which will trigger the inquiry.Regarding Deputy O'Dowd's point about penalties, if a bus operator is in breach of the terms of its private bus operator's licence under the 1932 Act it is a matter for the Garda which is supposed to pursue the matter.

The process of appointing a chief executive designate of the new authority will commence once those discussions have been finalised.Part 6 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 provides for the dissolution of the Dublin Transportation Office and the transfer of its employees to the Dublin Transport Authority in accordance with the detailed arrangements set out in that Part of the Act.

Is it intended that the new authority will become a national regulator since the budget was announced?  Will it become the regulator for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency and the entire country, not just the Dublin region?  I am aware it is intended that the new authority will absorb the Taxi Regulator.  Will this happen early next year?An editorial in the Irish Independent today called on the Minister for Transport to buy more buses following the report of the Dublin Transportation Office on quality bus corridors.  The report suggested there is a deficit of between 300 to 500 buses in the greater Dublin region.  Given the situation arising from the budget, what does the Minister intend to do to address this need and to address ongoing gridlock?

I refer to the DTA and fare structures.  It emerged during the debate on the DTA Bill that the new authority can identify transport trains originating outside of the Dublin area which are deemed to be fare-controlled by the authority.  A number of what is termed "promotional fare" increases are due from Iarnród Éireann.  Will the DTA be able to deal with these increases?  There are many inequalities and injustices in the fare system.  Locations equidistant from Dublin pay widely differing fares and there is no uniformity.  Commuters, especially those north of Dublin in counties Meath and Louth suffer greatly.  A commuter pays a Dublin fare as far as Balbriggan, however when one goes beyond Balbriggan to Louth or Meath one pays through the nose, which is unfair.  Iarnród Éireann has refused to deal with this matter.

The Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 recently commenced its passage through the Oireachtas and is currently in the Seanad.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to certain aspects of the ports' policy statement, which was launched in January 2005 and is available to view on my Department's website.  One of the key recommendations of the statement was the need to enhance port company performance through reform of the board structure.  These recommendations are the basis for the provisions on board structure, which are contained in the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008.  There will be ample opportunity to debate these proposals and other related matters during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  We are currently on Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad.

I appreciate that he acknowledged the letter he received from the Association of County and City Councils, but he had to do it.  In their letter, they state they do not want public representatives to be removed from the harbour authorities.  They believe they have a very important role to play in representing the local authorities near the port authorities.  It is very important to maintain that link, so will the Minister of State reverse the decision to exclude a certain number of local authority members, if not all of them, from the Bill?

The remit and culture of ports has changed since corporatisation came in.  They are now commercial State bodies.  Other commercial State bodies such as airport authorities do not have local authority members on their boards.  We are currently removing the statutory provision in which each port company would have three local authority members.  The Minister has agreed that the smaller boards will have eight members rather than the current 12,  but that one of the ministerial appointees will be a local authority member.  Therefore, there will be one local authority member out of eight board members rather than three out of 12.

Is this not a ferocious attack on local democracy?  The three councillors are being thrown off the boards of directors.  It is also wrong headed.  Who knows better than local councillors about the economic and social issues of the port areas?  When this Bill comes before the Dáil, I will ask the Minister of State to reconsider this aspect.A related matter is the cutting of the number of employee directors.  We have had a great tradition in Dublin and elsewhere in which the employees also had representation on the board, often to very good effect.  The Minister of State is preparing to cut the number down to just one employee director.  Will he and the senior Minister reconsider this on Committee Stage of the Bill when it comes before this House?  Deputy Ahern and I both served on Dublin City Council.  We worked closely together on many issues affecting the city——

There is a meeting this afternoon of the Association of County and City Councils across the street, and they are very upset about this.  It is another removal of local democratic powers and it is wrong.  The Minister of State was a hard-working councillor, and so was I.  We know what we tried to do to represent our people.  Is this not a backward step?  He must get rid of it.

It was the position until the mid 1990s that harbour authorities represented a broad church of people.  In some cases, there were 11 councillors on those boards, among others.  Various reports since then have stated that there should not be any councillors or port users.  The ports are now commercial State organisations like the Dublin Airport Authority.  We in the Department are trying to be consistent.  It is a different ball game now and we are trying to bring things into line.As a compromise, it has been agreed that one ministerial appointment would come from the councils, which is a half-way house between the old——

Like the Deputy, I spent 17 years on the council.  It is a case of giving them their full status in the appropriate places.The board representation is being reduced from 12 members to eight.  It is intended that there be one worker director rather than two.  Most of the ports are very small.  Some of them have nearly more on the board than they have as employees.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	531	As mentioned in the reply to the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers, my Department has been in discussion with the Commission for Taxi Regulation about a subsidy scheme to assist with the purchase of accessible vehicles over a five-year period that will meet the new accessible vehicle specification developed by the commission.  A number of options for the delivery of additional accessible vehicles are being explored by my Department, in order to improve accessibility to public transport for people with disabilities.The Department's public transport accessibility committee recently discussed the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis when considering a review of "Transport Access for All", which is the Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  The committee questioned whether, in the current economic environment and on practical grounds, it was necessary to provide for the entire fleet of taxis in urban areas to be wheelchair accessible.  My Department will engage further with the Commission for Taxi Regulation to identify whether a more cost effective approach to the provision of adequate numbers of wheelchair accessible taxis can be developed.

When does he envisage these discussions to finish?  When does he envisage being able to assist taxi and hackney operators to purchase wheelchair accessible taxis?  Does he intend to publish any policy document on this?  He has just indicated that there now seems to be a policy change in the area.

There has been discussion on the progress made and on where we need to go over the next few years.  We will be producing that document towards the end of this month.  The issue will be discussed then.I cannot give a timescale for the discussions with the taxi regulator, but I do not think there will be any undue delay.  It is a matter that we should try to resolve as quickly as possible, so that we can introduce the scheme quickly.

What percentage of taxis are now wheelchair accessible?  How much funding does the Minister of State intend to make available for this scheme?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The number of licensed wheelchair accessible taxis increased from 840 in 2000 to 1,504 in December 2007.  A further 216 applications for wheelchair accessible taxis were received by the commission up to the end of September this year.  Under Transport 21, the Department has a provision of €14 million in 2008 for funding accessibility improvements.  Some of the money for the scheme would come from that.  I cannot recall what the total figure for this was, but it is larger than that amount.  I do not have the figure here, so I will have to revert to the Deputy.

Is funding being provided for that and will it happen?  Given that we now have well over 26,000 taxis, which is substantially more than the greater London area with a population three or four times that of the Republic, does the Minister consider this matter a priority?  Is the Minister still opposed to any moratorium or cap on issuing licences, despite recent discussions at the Joint Committee on Transport?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The issue initially raised in the Deputy's supplementary question is a matter for the taxi regulator.  I am not privy to the details of what progress has been made in that regard.  I am sure, however, that if she said she would have the standards protocol in place in January, she will do so.As regards the moratorium, I have followed with interest the discussions at the Joint Committee on Transport concerning taxi regulation.  It was made clear at the committee that, given the High Court decision, the law as it stands makes it impossible for any kind of moratorium to be introduced just on the basis of controlling numbers.  The report the committee compiled will be examined, however.  I am aware of the various legal viewpoints that were put forward in that report, which will be considered in the Department.

The High Court decision reversed that trend.  The belief now, particularly among taxi drivers, is that there are too many licences, but the law is as it currently stands.  With the introduction of improved standards by the taxi regulator, many of the concerns currently being expressed can be met.Deputy Stanton referred to the introduction of a pilot scheme.  The discussions I mentioned at the outset relate to that matter.  There was extensive discussion by the Commission on Taxi Regulation.  In the course of the committee's hearings on public transport accessibility, which reviewed the disability plan, a view was expressed that the commitment in the programme for Government to making wheelchair accessible taxis widely available was not deemed to be an absolute necessity.  It is on that basis, therefore, that we will talk to the taxi regulator again to see if we can produce some sort of scheme that is not as widespread as originally envisaged.

At the first meeting of the Cabinet committee, it was agreed that the statutory powers available to the civil authorities and to An Garda Síochána regarding the search and inspection of aircraft, including those under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, would be reviewed in the context of the obligations on the State under the Chicago Convention, which governs international civil air transport.  The purpose of this examination is to determine how the current statutory provisions could be strengthened or amended in the context of our agreed international commitments under the Chicago Convention.  The review is being undertaken by the Attorney General's office in conjunction with the relevant officials and the outcome will be considered by the Cabinet committee in due course.

Does the Minister agree that the quicker that review is done, the better?  We have been told that Shannon Airport has been used by certain aeroplanes which may have been involved in extraordinary rendition in other countries.  If the people who own those planes are aware that we may search them if they land, it will make it much more likely that extraordinary rendition will not take place, if it ever did, through our country.  It would also defend our human rights in that regard by standing up to ensure, in as much as we possibly can, that it does not happen here.

There should be no undue delay in reviewing all the relevant legislation.  However, gardaí must always be mindful that they have to form reasonable opinions that something illegal is going on.  The fact that a plane might at some stage have been involved in extraordinary rendition in some other country is, of itself, not enough in current circumstances for gardaí to board and inspect an aircraft.  It is important, therefore, to review all of that, including how the law can be strengthened.  Together with my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, I am anxious to clarify this matter and strengthen the legislation as quickly as possible.

Higgins, is to publish an air transport navigation Bill, which would give the authorities the necessary legislation to which the Minister has referred.  Would the Minister be interested in supporting the Labour Party's Bill on the inspection of aircraft coming through Shannon and other airports?I wish to raise a related matter, which is the massive seizure of cocaine off our coast last week.  Has there been any review of security and customs arrangements at private airports?  The Maynooth community residents' association wrote to the Minister recently asking him if regular inspections of flights were being carried out at Weston airport.  When a tragedy happened a few weeks ago, we became aware for the first time of a little airstrip outside Athy at Kilrush.  Are private aircraft at airfields, such as Kilrush and Weston, currently being inspected?  Does the Minister intend to undertake any review of this area? My colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, and I were promised something like this about a year and a half ago, but we still have not got it.

There is not much point in producing legislation that ignores international treaties.  I am not for one minute saying that the Deputy would do that.The review of security and customs and excise at airports is a matter in the first instance for either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I understand there is a constant review of the adequacy of security at airports.  The IAA also has a function.  I believe airstrips are subject to IAA inspection rather than Customs and Excise inspection.

The Department of Transport has the power to refuse permission for a plane to land.  Will the Minister consider the reasons for refusing permission to land in light of this issue?  Of the thousands of flights which have sought permission to land only five have been refused permission in the past number of years and one reason for a refusal is when it is believed that certain munitions are being carried.  Will the Minister include extraordinary rendition as a reason for a refusal to land considering only a small number of planes may be involved and this may be another way of dealing with the issue?

I asked the city authorities to carry out those studies.  The Cork study is being carried out under CASP, the Cork area strategic plan, and is now substantially complete.  In the case of Limerick, a tendering process is being conducted for consultants to carry out the examination and feasibility of an LRT-BRT in the context of the mid-west region.  Galway City Council is also in the process of tendering for consultants to carry out a study of LRT-BRT for the city.  Waterford City Council is finalising the appointment of a consultant to carry out a feasibility study.  Apart from Cork, consultants are being appointed and expect to produce these reports within the two years' framework.

This Bill does that, providing for an increase of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic social welfare payments next year.  Total expenditure on social welfare next year will be €19.6 billion.  This is an increase of €2.6 billion over the Estimates allocation for 2008.  It is important to note that the schemes and other supports which the Department of Social and Family Affairs administers will benefit over 1.7 million people.  This includes 440,000 pensioners, 345,000 ill and disabled people, over 80,000 carers, 30,000 low income families who will be availing of family income supplement and more than 580,000 families who receive child benefit payments.Provision has been made for an increase of €2.6 billion in social welfare expenditure in 2009, and this is to be welcomed.  I also welcome the fact that as we enter the winter season and those long, dark evenings, provision has been made for an 11% increase in the value of the fuel allowance, bringing it to €20 per week from January.  I am pleased the duration of the fuel season is also being increased and it will now be 32 weeks in total.Social welfare is an important part of Government.  It is the duty of Government to look after those people who require assistance.  There is no doubt we are living in difficult economic times.  Most of the world is currently experiencing some form of economic slowdown.  Now is the time for calm heads and clear thinking.  The Irish people have a great ability to knuckle down and get through any difficulties or obstacles that might come their way.  If we work together over the next few years, we can ride out the current turbulence we are experiencing.We have always been a caring nation which has always been aware of the importance of looking after the less fortunate.  While some may be of the view the Celtic tiger may have desensitised us to the hardship of others, I do not believe this to have been the case.  In my time as a Deputy I have consistently been impressed and encouraged by the amount of good work that goes on all around the country for those who are less well-off.  Much of this work is voluntary and is carried out away from the limelight.  It is heartening to witness the goodwill and decency of people around the country — long may it continue.The Bill acknowledges there are people and families who require assistance.  I was delighted to see that changes to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Combat Poverty Agency were also announced on budget day.  The Bill is amending the Citizens Information Acts 2000 to 2007 so as to enhance the functions of the Citizens Information Board through the assignment to it of responsibility for the provision of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  MABS provides a valuable service to people who are in debt and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.As we approach the Christmas period, which seems to be arriving earlier every year, it is important to realise that many families will put themselves under severe financial pressure over the festive season.  What should be a time of joy for people instead becomes a time of worry, when mothers and fathers will fall victim to the commercialisation of the Christmas period.  I am sure we all know of constituents who have resorted to measures such as loan sharks in an attempt to keep the wolf from the door.  Anything that can be done to alleviate such situations is to be welcomed.I take the opportunity to justifiably compliment the staff of MABS in Longford, with whom I have had numerous dealings, and also the staff of the Citizens Information Board, who also do great work in Longford.

Educating people regarding their finances and how to embark on good financial practice is a good first step.  As I said, I have the height of respect for MABS and the work it does.There will be €515 million worth of improvements in social welfare rates for the coming year.  I believe this shows a determination to protect those in our society who most need our support, such as pensioners, families dependent on social welfare payments and those who are seeking employment.  Increases have been targeted to deliver a package of supports for those who are mainly on a fixed income and are some of the most vulnerable in our society.We are currently experiencing difficult economic times compared to previous budgets and the Government has had to make some difficult decisions in order to secure our economic future.  Overall spending on social welfare schemes is greatly increased with €19.6 billion planned to be spent supporting more than 1.7 million men, women and children in our country.It is important to bear some of the figures in mind.  The coming year will see an increase of €7 per week for all State pensioners, contributory and non-contributory, along with carers aged 66 and over.  Increases for qualified adults range from €4.30 to €6.30 per week for those over 66 years of age.  What all this means is that a pensioner couple will have a weekly increase of €13.30 per week.  Over €260 million extra has been targeted to support people of working age claiming jobseeker's benefit or allowance, which increases by €6.50 per week from January 2009.  Overall, 733,000 people are in receipt of working age payments, such as jobseekers, one-parent families and those claiming illness benefit and disability allowance, as well as carers.  They will all benefit from increases in weekly personal rates in the coming year.There have been targeted increases for families with children who are in receipt of social welfare payments or low income earners through the family income supplement.  Family income supplement is to increase the earnings threshold by €10 per child, which gives an increase of up to €6 per week per child.  For those in receipt of social welfare payments with children, the qualified child increase rises from €24 to €26 per week from January.  There is also an extension in the numbers eligible to claim the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  It was also announced that €500,000 is being provided to the Family Support Agency to develop a programme to promote positive parenting skills.  We must not forget that the family is at the centre of our society and anything that can contribute to families is to be welcomed.I support the Bill and believe it has the interest of those most vulnerable in our society at heart.  We are all human and must never forget that behind the raft of statistics and numbers we all encounter every day, there are real people.  The Bill caters for those real people and understands the needs of the most vulnerable sections of our society in these changed economic times.I welcome the news that the Christmas bonus has been confirmed for social welfare recipients

I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, has confirmed that the Christmas bonus will be paid to a range of people, including widows, widowers, pensioners, one-parent families and the long-term unemployed.  As I have already said, I compliment a compassionate and caring Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  The Hanafin family has given immense public service to the country, which is acknowledged by all.The Government ensured that this Christmas bonus payment would be protected as so many people rely on the extra money at Christmas and use it to plan their finances over that period.  Christmas is a time of financial pressure for families, especially those who rely on social welfare payments, and the Government is keen to provide practical support where it can.As we are coming to the Christmas period, I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Naughten and the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and all my colleagues in the Dáil, a very happy Christmas.

Following Deputy Kelly's contribution, I could go on for a considerable time but I will try to keep within the 20 minutes.  I acknowledge the work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  We are all blue in the face hearing calls for public service reform.  If a leaf, however, was taken out of the book of how the Department of Social and Family Affairs and its officials function, it could be used as a blueprint for public service reform.  While I accept there are current staffing difficulties, down through the years it has been the most proactive Department in getting information to the public and the best in customer service.The IFA made a pre-budget submission concerning the exclusion of short PRSI contribution periods in the calculation of a State contributory pension.  While the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, may not be aware of a case regarding a constituent of mine that I raised in the House last year, the departmental officials will recall it.  I will put it on the record of the House once more.In 1961 there was a 'flu epidemic with a large number of deaths and many people unable to work.  My constituent worked for four weeks, commencing on 31 January 1961, at St. Brigid's psychiatric hospital, Ballinasloe.  He did so, solely to help out with the staffing crisis in the hospital caused by the influenza outbreak.  As a result, his PRSI record is averaged from that date rather than 1987 when he started paying PRSI in his own right as a self-employed farmer.  Previous to that, he had been on a community employment scheme.  The only reason he took on the month's work at the hospital was that his sister, a nurse in the hospital, pleaded with him to help her to take care of the patients because of the staffing crisis.  The man had no qualifications to work in the area but did a good deed to help out under difficult circumstances.  Some €2,600 per year, however, is being deducted from his pension entitlement because of this favour.  I do not believe that individual should be penalised as a result of this.  The IFA argued in its pre-budget submission for the exemption of employment periods of up to one year.  While I accept that might be too extensive, my constituent, who was only being a good Samaritan, is being penalised.  It is an issue that needs to be examined.The other issue I wish to raise is one the departmental officials are blue in the face from listening to me talking about.  It concerns the non-contributory State pension, a means-tested payment.  In 2006, it had an employment earnings disregard of €100 per week which was doubled in the 2007 budget.  However, the self-employed and farmers do not qualify for the disregard.  Young and elderly farmers have already been penalised in this budget with the changes to the installation aid and the early retirement scheme.  A small change in how the non-contributory State pension is calculated for farmers could encourage the release of farming land to non-blood relations.There are no difficulties with calculating the pension when a family member takes over a farm, as it is deemed no income is generated.  When a farmer leases out his land, however, every cent he receives is deducted from the non-contributory old age pension.  Amending this would be a mechanism in releasing land on to the market which would help retiring and start-off farmers.  The Ceann Comhairle would have similar experience from his constituency.  I hope this anomaly in the system will be examined.A perennial issue in pension entitlement is that of women who worked in caring duties in the home.  A calculation was built into it from 1994 under the home-makers' scheme but for those prior to 1994 there was no recognition.  Again, a small change in the legislation would be very beneficial to those women who were the backbone of rural Ireland.The current economic conditions are as a result of our mistakes, not because of the international credit crunch.  In 2006, the Exchequer had a surplus of €4 billion.  By the end of next year, it will be €12 billion in the red.  That means that in the intervening 22 months, €10 million a week will have been misspent.  The Government is responsible for this but I had hoped it would live up to that responsibility when it decided to present the budget.  We all expected large changes and prepared for difficult decisions to be made but it was a disappointment.  I acknowledge difficult decisions must be made but the budget did nothing to deal with the issues of trying to encourage people off social welfare and back into employment through re-training, re-skilling and returning to education.My colleague, Deputy Olwyn Enright, has highlighted the problems with the back-to-education allowance.  Another issue concerns the lack of language skills.  A sizeable percentage of people on the live register are not Irish citizens — they are from the EU and outside it — who do not have basic English language skills.  They will never fill out a job application form or get an interview if they do not have basic English language and communications skills.  There is also a similar issue with our own population and the lack of literacy skills.  We should be targeting these elements of the live register to tap into what is a valuable resource and ensure those people have the ability to fill out application forms, properly communicate at job interviews and get the opportunity to get back into worthwhile employment.Section 24 amends the Civil Registration Act 2004.  It is an issue close to my own heart as the General Register Office is based in my home town, Roscommon.  The civil registry authorities in the office and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been very critical of a recent Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform claim of 1,000 sham marriages in Ireland, marriages of convenience to facilitate residency in Ireland or the EU.  Little seems to have been done about this.  Section 58 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which will be amended by this Bill, allows a person to register an objection to a marriage before it occurs if they believe there is some impediment to marriage.  If the Minister for Social and Family Affairs or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are so concerned about what they believe are statistical anomalies, surely they can use their good offices to cause the occasional objection to be submitted.  Officials at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have stated that they are being told by staff at the General Register Office that couples are coming in to register their intention to marry who cannot even communicate with each other in a common language.  If that is happening, why is section 58 of the legislation not being enforced?  Instead, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is saying he will make his own provisions in this regard.  The law is not being enforced.I ask the Minister to consider this issue before Committee Stage and, if the legislation is not working efficiently at the moment, to deal with it by introducing an amendment.  However, there is not much point in talking about sham marriages if there are so many taking place that even people who cannot communicate with each other are registering to marry.  There are provisions in the legislation to block such marriages, but that is not happening.  Why not?  I hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will respond to this when she returns to the House.Another issue I have raised on a number of occasions is the habitual residence condition.  Approximately 1,700 Irish citizens, including religious missionaries, have been refused social welfare benefits since this condition was introduced in 2004 to deal with welfare tourism.  I accept that provisions have to be put in place to deal with this and that for the staff who are dealing with it on a day-to-day basis it is difficult to obtain clarity.  I have spoken to such staff on a number of occasions.  However, surely we should be trying to support people such as Irish citizens who have been residing in the United States and have come home to take care of elderly relatives.The Department would say it takes a flexible approach in this regard, but one of the things required is proof that all links with one's former country of habitual residence, in this case, the United States, have been severed.  That is all well and good if one was legally in the US — one will have one's bank accounts, social security documentation and so on.  However, many of our citizens in the US are illegal.  They do not have bank accounts and cannot get driver's licences.  Thus, they are not in a position to prove through documentary evidence that they have severed their links with the United States because they cannot have documents in the US in the first place.Carer's allowance applications have also been refused on the basis of the habitual residence condition.  I accept that there are good reasons for this condition, but these should not apply to the carer's allowance.  If someone is prepared to care on an ongoing basis for an elderly or disabled person, his or her country of origin should not make any difference.  One already has to prove one is providing full-time care and attention and that the person requires full-time care and attention.  Surely that should be enough.  If the person is doing that he or she should be entitled to the carer's allowance.We are not concerned here with a large number of people.  Approximately 40 applications for carer's allowance are refused each year.  I suspect the vast majority of these are from Irish citizens who have come back to care for their elderly parents, perhaps without severing their links with their former country of residence.  If they have decided to come home and take care of parents who are no longer able to live on their own and cannot afford to go into a nursing home, they should be entitled to the carer's allowance on that basis.In this legislation we are tinkering again with the early child care supplement.  It galls me to think that the Irish taxpayer is funding child care costs in Warsaw, Tallinn, Riga and in every European country.  The child care supplement was introduced to deal with a specific problem that exists in this country — the astronomical cost of child care.  I cannot understand why we have not introduced amending legislation to deal with this issue when €1,100 — from now on, €1,104 — per year is going out of the country for each child receiving child care in another European country.  There is an issue with regard to child benefit and there is not much we can do about that.  However, there are major issues not only with regard to migrants claiming child benefit but also with regard to tax entitlements for individuals and couples; these are currently before the Supreme Court.  This must be examined so we can resolve the anomaly.  Things are far easier in the UK where a different system is in place.  Perhaps with some ingenuity we can consider ways of dealing with some of the anomalies that have been created.The Minister is very strong on anti-fraud initiatives and introduced the conditions for jobseeker's benefit.  However, the Department of Social and Family Affairs is being defrauded of €36 million in child benefit, €30 million of which is in respect of Irish citizens.  It should be easy enough to trace this with current technology, including the computerised register of births, marriages and deaths in the General Register Office.  Another €5.4 million of this total is in respect of children who do not exist in other countries.  Again, with the technology available we should be able to deal with this.  It is frustrating that early child care supplement must be paid in respect of children in other countries, but we cannot continue to brush under the carpet the fact that the child care supplement is being paid in respect of children who do not exist.  While the Minister is strong on talk when dealing with issues of fraud, her actions have been very slow and we have yet to see the colour of her money in this regard.The Irish Refugee Council raised the issue of direct provision to asylum seekers in Ireland.  Again, we do not want to encourage welfare tourism, but €9.60 per week is the current payment to a minor in hostel accommodation.  These children are going to local schools, some of them in my own constituency.  Given that their parents do not have the necessary resources and because the community welfare officers are snowed under dealing with other cases, they are not given assistance in paying for school tours or activities such as swimming.  We cannot expect schools to bring half the pupils swimming or on a school tour and leave the other half behind.  As a result, schools are not going on school tours.  They cannot go next year in any event because of the cutbacks in education, but they have not been going up to now.I had hoped the Minister would take into account the submission made by the Carers Association.  One issue I wish to mention in this regard is the possibility of increasing the number of hours people can work outside the home to 20.  One example is that of a mother who is caring for a disabled child and is working outside the home during school hours.  She is providing full-time care and assistance while the child is in the home but while the child is at school she is disbarred from taking up employment for between 15 and 20 hours because of the rules that pertain.  Surely where a child is in full-time education we can get around this obstacle.  There is an issue with regard to elderly people but it is not just elderly people who receive care.  There are also young people.  In addition, let us not forget the large cohort of 5,000 young carers who are being ignored at the moment.

I am delighted my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Curran is here.  I congratulate him on all the work he is doing with the disadvantaged people in our society.  Speaking earlier, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, said it is always important to look after our social welfare recipients, especially in times of economic strife and hardship.  Unfortunately, we have reached such a time.  Not only is our public spending being tightly controlled and closely monitored, but each individual citizen finds himself or herself in a similar predicament.  We will all be affected and a large portion of society is vulnerable during this downturn.I assure people on social welfare that this Government, like all Fianna Fáil Governments, has the interests of less well off people at heart.  Despite our economic downturn, I am saddened having listened to a number of Opposition speakers because they did not acknowledge the generous social welfare budget proposed by the Government.

Given the reality of our finances — tax income is down at least €6.5 billion this year and next year we will face a deficit of €13 billion to keep our economy afloat and look after the less well off in society — the Opposition should acknowledge that the Government is doing a good job.  Regarding the Bill, the minimum the Opposition could have done was acknowledge the large increase the Government provided in the budget.

Deputy Naughten conveniently ignores this, but in time he may reflect on it.

We are providing €2.5 billion extra in social welfare while the Opposition proposes to borrow €4 billion.

That is what Fianna Fáil and its partners in Government are about.  This Bill will formalise increases across the social welfare sector.  The budget is €19.6 billion, some 15% above the 2008 figure.  The increases in the Bill are above inflation and will benefit 1.7 million people, including 290,000 people who, unfortunately, will come on the live register in the next year.There are 444,000 pensioners in Ireland.  Fianna Fáil and its Governments have always looked after old age pensioners.  Our colleagues in Fine Gael and Labour cannot look with pride on their records. Their last Minister, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, gave a derisory increase of £1.50.  Deputy Naughten would be slightly embarrassed about that and Deputy Burton is very embarrassed by it.  I have seen her cringe when that has been mentioned.

In these unstable times, these people fall victim to those in Opposition and the media who cast the darkest light on their future.  Older people panic.  They rely most on our social welfare system and have difficulty fending for themselves.  It is, therefore, incumbent on us to look after them.  The Government is well aware of this and has striven in this budget, and all the budgets we have been involved in, to ensure the welfare of pensioners.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has done a fantastic job increasing spending for the elderly by over €166 million, given the level of the reduction in finances.  An increase of €7 per week in the contributory and non-contributory State pensions is most generous, bringing the weekly State contributory pension to €230.30 and the non-contributory pension to €219.   I have met many pensioners in my constituency and was generous and bold enough to go out and meet them on the streets when they were out there some weeks ago.

It recognises that elderly people suffer the most during cold winter times.  I acknowledge what the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has done by increasing this allowance by 11%, bringing the weekly payment to €20.  That forms part of a €30 million package which, in the current climate, is significant.  The duration of the fuel allowance has been increased by two weeks to 32 weeks beginning next April.  The Department is in the process of a policy review on State pensions.  The new framework is expected to be announced by the end of the year and I look forward to it.Some €56 million has been made available to improve the social welfare package for families and children.  Over 30,000 families will avail of this increased funding.  There is a €2 increase in the qualifying child payment, meaning parents will receive an additional €26 per child on top of their basic social welfare payments.  All family income supplement threshold incomes have been increased by €10, bringing an additional 2,000 families into the net of entitlement under this scheme.  The income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance has also increased and that allows an extra 18,000 families to benefit.  While child benefit will no longer be paid to non-qualifying children over the age of 18 beyond 2009, a compensatory payment of €15 per week will be paid to disadvantaged families who receive social welfare payments for qualifying children aged over 18.The early childhood supplement is expected to cost almost €400 million, another significant figure, with the aim of supporting parents with the expense of child care.  Minor changes have been made to pay periods and age eligibility resulting in a saving to the Department of €93 million, which has been put to very good use elsewhere.  A further €500,000 is to be given to the family support agency to develop a programme in support of parenting skills.  Every Deputy recognises the need for such a programme in each of our constituencies.People of working age will benefit from increases in social welfare payments.  Increases of €6.50 a week will be applied to jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, disability allowance, one-parent family payment, carer's benefit and carer's allowance.  An additional €4.80 will be added to all payments in respect of each qualifying adult.  All Members of the House should recognise that the increase in question is substantial in the context of this country's current financial constraints.  Savings are being made in other areas.  Changes are to be made to the qualifying contributions of those applying for payments under schemes like jobseeker's allowance.  People will have to demonstrate they have worked for a longer period of time before they are entitled to get jobseeker's allowance.  That change has been made in recognition of the financial constraints on the Exchequer.  I hope we will be in a position to increase the benefit again in a couple of years when the economy picks up once more.We are all familiar with the work done by carers, often in our own families.  We owe such people a great debt of gratitude for the work they do.  By increasing the amount of money paid to recipients of carer's allowance who are over the age of 66 by €7, to €239, the Government has shown that it recognises the importance of the work of carers.  A similar increase of €6.50, to €220.50, will be made available to recipients of the allowance who are under the age of 66.  A further increase of €6.50, to €221.20, will apply to those who receive the carer's benefit and constant attendance allowances.  Carers do marvellous work for the elderly and infirm in our society.  I pay tribute to them because without them, society would be much less well-off.My friends on the Opposition benches were engaging in the usual scaremongering recently when they suggested the Christmas bonus would not be paid to social welfare recipients.  I am delighted the Minister and the Government have confirmed the bonus will be paid as normal.  I have spoken to people who recognise the Government's generosity in this respect.  Many people, including old age pensioners, were expecting a tough budget.  They were worried they might not get the same amount of money in this area as they were previously getting.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, for making an expeditious decision in this regard.  I acknowledge her generosity, which is appreciated by the elderly people of this State.  It is nice that they got the news early to allow them to plan for Christmas.When one examines the overall state of the country's finances, it is clear this social welfare package is most generous.  It would have been reasonable to assume that no increases could be made.  Many people believed that greater restrictions and reductions in benefits would be necessary.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments have looked after this country's older people.  As a backbench Deputy, I think that is how it should be.  The people in question built up this country to bring it to where it is.  They are entitled to receive our support.I would like to make some comments in the overall context of budgetary issues.  I refer to the problems being encountered by big countries throughout the world, such as the United States, Britain, Germany and our European neighbours.  Some of those problems are caused by the downturn in the global economy and the banking crisis, which started in the US.  Massive corporations like Lehman Brothers have collapsed.  We should recognise that these are extraordinary times.  It should be acknowledged that the Government took decisive action when it put in place the bank guarantee scheme.  If that had not been done, we would not be talking about increases in the social welfare package.  We would have to deal with major financial difficulties.  I do not doubt that our Opposition colleagues will decry the scheme.  They should recognise that Fianna Fáil and its partners in government have shown leadership on the banking issue.  The decisive action we have taken has saved this country's banking institutions and benefited our economy as a whole.

When Opposition Deputies contribute to this debate, they should admit that a banking system is necessary for our trading and commerce industries.  They should acknowledge that the plan the Government introduced has been copied by many of our European partners, some of which were sceptical when we proposed to introduce it in the first instance.  When other countries found they had the exact same problems as Ireland, they copied the Irish scheme.  That is a testament to the virtue of the action the Government was seen to take.  While we have heard many criticisms from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, we have never heard the representatives of those parties proposing any solutions.

Since 1996, the social insurance fund has been in surplus, as the PRSI contributions from employees and employers exceeded the payouts to people claiming social welfare or pensions.  However, the Government's mismanagement of the economy has landed us in a serious and deteriorating position in respect of the fund.  This year, because of increasing unemployment, it is expected the fund will have an annual deficit of €223 million and that the deficit will be at least €900 million in 2009.  In other words, the shortage in income compared to expenditure will be €900 million.  At this rate, the accumulated surplus on the fund could be exhausted by 2011.  This year the Minister expected a surplus on the fund of €548 million but, instead, she anticipates a deficit of €223 million.  This has grave consequences for future budgets and for PRSI.The Government parties promised in their programme for Government to reform PRSI by abolishing the PRSI ceiling, currently €52,000, and reducing rates.  Instead of reforming PRSI, the Government chose to introduce a 1% levy on all incomes, bar social welfare payments, below the minimum wage.  Running the social insurance fund on to the rocks could have a significant impact on the unemployed and on pensioners expecting their contributory old age pension.  I do not know whether the Government is planning callously to bequeath to the next Government a disastrous social insurance fund position.Public accounting has collapsed in recent years.  The Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs, have lost their ability to make accurate forecasts of economic activity, tax revenues or, in this case, the movement on the social insurance fund.  There is a need for a public actuary, possibly based in the NTMA.  He or she would prepare reliable, independent forecasts in respect of pension liabilities, unemployment liabilities and the contributions required to sustain a properly funded system.  The Minister and the Government are asleep on the job regarding what is happening in the social insurance fund.  It may well be that civil servants have advised the Minister but she chose to ignore what is happening to the fund.  The fund was brought into surplus during the rainbow Government on a hard fought basis.  When the Labour Party went into Government with Fianna Fáil in 1992, we inherited an unemployment rate of 18%.  I served with the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and, by 1996, when my party was in Government in the rainbow coalition, the fund was in surplus.  That is being thrown away and the consequences of the deficit being built up by the Minister are horrendous for both the economy and people who rely on social welfare payments.The absence of a single back-to-work measure in the legislation is remarkable, despite 100,000 people losing their jobs over the past year.  I do not know how the Minister could produce a social welfare Bill that does not contain a measure to encourage people who must rely on social welfare for a brief period to move into education, training or employment.  Are the Minister and her officials oblivious to the plight of the unemployed?  Could she not find time to introduce even a single concrete back-to-work measure?  In the current economic climate, that is not only an oversight but a dereliction of duty.The Bill contains a serious number of new poverty traps, the impact of which the Minister and her staff have the capacity to analyse, avoid or to limit.  The greatest poverty trap is rent allowance because people are barred from working if they are in receipt of this allowance or mortgage subsidies.  Unfortunately, many men engaged in construction are losing their jobs and this is impacting on dual income couples.  They often have mortgage repayments of between €1,600 and €2,000 per month.  To obtain a mortgage subsidy or rent allowance, they and all the members of their household have to be unemployed and State dependent.  Thus, many people at risk of mortgage default because of a combination of high monthly repayments, negative equity and shrinking employment prospects will be encouraged to go from work to welfare and not to return to work to maintain the roof over their heads.  This is one of the most pressing issues facing the Minister and her Department.  This is a policy failure on her part, which will have negative social consequences.  If people are unemployed for more than a year or two, it becomes endemic in families and then it becomes intergenerational.  We will be back to where we started in 1992 with many areas in which unemployment is intergenerational.I refer to the measures relating to people involved in agriculture.  Many people in the west are part-time farmers and they were involved in the construction industry.  They are becoming unemployed and the Government is cutting the farm schemes which allowed part-time farmers to work in construction.  I am from Dublin city centre and what I know about farming would fit on a postage stamp but the Government's proposals will save very little and they make no economic sense.  People will be driven back into social welfare rather than allowing them to maintain an individual income.The Labour Party has published detailed proposals for back-to-work and education schemes, including a national insulation scheme, which would also address our carbon emissions rather than the limited, small project put forward in the budget.  We also proposed a school building programme with important consequences and benefits not only for people living in towns and working in the construction industry but also for people living in rural areas.  Many people becoming unemployed in the construction industry have the skills which, with training and upskilling, could become the engineers, technicians and IT consultants of tomorrow.  However, the Minister's legislation does not have a visionary element, as it proposes to restrict rather than encourage.The message from the Government is loud and clear.  Fat cat bankers get bailouts, property developers get tax breaks but the people on the bottom rung of the economic ladder get a kick in the teeth.  Unfortunately, the Minister is like the Grinch, stealing Christmas from thousands of hard pressed families across the country.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	626	A man who came into my clinic in a rural part of Wicklow the other night said he always voted Labour for which I was very grateful, but he proceeded to tell me why.  He said it was because when he was unemployed social welfare provisions were changed — I think I am correct in saying that Deputy Burton was Minister of State in the Department at the time when Labour was in Government — to enable people continue on unemployment payments while they were creating a job for themselves.  The most striking aspect of the budget is the fact that there is nothing in it that one could describe as an economic stimulus.  There is nothing in the budget, or, indeed, in the legislation flowing from it such as this Bill, which indicates that the Government has any intention of ensuring people end up not dependent on social welfare but employed and paying taxes, as the rest of us fortunate enough to be working are able to do.Unemployment is the single biggest issue.  It drains economic power out of people.  It drains families of hope.  It has significant consequences in communities.  We all have been there before.  We know the extent of the toxic effect of high unemployment.The importance of dealing with unemployment and ensuring that jobs are both protected and generated is recognised in Great Britain and in the US.  Facing financial turbulence, there is still the core recognition difficult that we need an economic stimulus package to ensure that people are not dependent unnecessarily on social welfare but can work for a living.  Indeed, it is interesting to note that the IMF makes the point that this should be a global approach.  In little Ireland, what we see is a budget that seems to determine that thousands of people will end up on social welfare unnecessarily because of a political approach so myopic it is determined to simply cut back in the case of the most vulnerable and try to weather the storm in that way.We know what is happening.  Fine Gael is the party which pointed out that every three minutes a job is being lost.  Predominantly, the job being lost is in the construction industry.  We are speaking about people with skills, experience and training who would be well able, for example, as the Labour Party has proposed, to participate in and contribute to a school building programme and, with a certain amount of retraining, to a national insulation scheme.  A national insulation scheme would provide a double benefit.  It is not just about keeping people at work.  It is also about ensuring that our total energy bill is reduced.We face a major challenge in terms of the commitments up to which we must live to tackle climate change.  I have just come from the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security which heard a presentation from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  There is a strong argument, which I would endorse, that in no way should Irish agriculture be expected to live up to the 20% reduction.  We are good at growing grass and rearing cattle and that is what we should be doing in terms of future food security.  However, that means in other areas there must be even greater efforts to ensure we meet targets and, in my view, there is nowhere more beneficial than a national insulation programme.It is pathetic the way fuel poverty is being dealt with.  The provision of €2 extra and two extra weeks' allowance borders on insult to people trying to struggle with very steeply increasing fuel bills.  Last week when I raised with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, the extent of the problem of people living in fuel poverty, he did not even have information on how many are affected, either by permanent or intermittent fuel poverty.  Despite the fact that a fuel energy research project was set up in 2006 and the findings of that group, which is supposedly working on fuel poverty, were promised and should have been already published, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, proudly states he is part of an interdepartmental group looking at why people cannot manage to keep themselves warm this and every other winter.  The answer is fairly obvious, that fuel prices have gone up, people's incomes have not gone up, there are more people on social welfare and there is a grossly inadequate provision in terms of the fuel allowance.Age Action Ireland clearly stated its beliefs.  According to data from fairly reputable sources in the non-governmental area, it would represent many of the 60,000 people living in permanent fuel poverty and 160,000 living in intermittent fuel poverty.  That is a significant cohort of our people.  Age Action Ireland has argued that the fuel allowance should be increased to €30, that there should be an increased payment starting in October-November, and that there should be the obvious provision made for two simple payments, in October and January, to facilitate those with oil-fired central heating.Often people do not recognise the difficulty.  We all picture the old lady trying to keep warm in her house because it is poorly insulated and because she cannot afford to put coal on the fire.  However, it is reckoned that 2,000 people in a winter die from cold-related conditions.  We have a high level of mortality from that kind of illness compared to other countries.Other countries very similar to ours have done something about this.  In Britain, there is a fuel poverty strategy.  It has been subject to a certain amount of criticism and the British Government has responded.  Northern Ireland, as part of the UK, has a fuel poverty strategy with measures in place.  These measures, which take time, are beginning to be applied in a way that can have a significant impact on those who need them most.We, in the Republic of Ireland, do not have a fuel poverty strategy.  There is a pittance coming from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and I thank her for that.  There is rhetoric from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, which is something we really must challenge.  It seems that when it comes to energy the focus is totally on the environment with no emphasis on the social needs of our people.  That is a distorted view of the role of political leadership.  We must ensure that changes occurring, whether increased fuel prices or measures we must introduce to meet our climate change targets, are sustainable in social, as well as environmental, terms.There is a crazy situation, which I have raised on many occasions and which the Minister is examining, where back boilers are being taken out of local authority houses and oil-fired central heating installed instead.  There is no effort to introduce the high-grade insulation scheme that could make a difference.  There is no effort to introduce environmentally sustainable, alternative and renewable sources of fuel.  In fact, if one asks the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government whether one is allowed to install a solar panel in a local authority house, one is told one can do it but is on one's own with nothing coming from Government.  That is not good policy, certainly not for people living in fuel poverty.

In good times it is easy to put together a budget to keep everybody happy.  However, in difficult times such as those we face today it is not so easy.  Harsh and tough decisions must be taken by the Minister and the Government.  The Minister has made fair decisions which will protect those who need protection in our society.  She is following in the footsteps of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Social and Family Affairs through the years.  The Minister recognises, as did her predecessors, the need, duty and responsibility to care for all those who need help and support.Historically, Fianna Fáil has consistently delivered increases above and beyond the rate of inflation and innovative schemes which are the envy of social welfare recipients in many other countries throughout Europe.

All Governments which held office since that date have been responsible and played their part in ensuring our economy was able to change from those dire days to such a success in recent years.We are not revisiting the days of the early 1980s but the numbers in receipt of social welfare are increasing and are predicted to increase to approximately 7% this year.  As we are aware, this is due to the change in the world economy.  What happens in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe has a serious impact on our economy.  We are a small open trading economy and 85% to 90% of our GDP is obtained through exports.  The United States of America is the recipient of approximately 19% of our exports, the United Kingdom receives 18% and the European Union receives 40%.The strengthening of the euro against sterling and the US dollar has made it more difficult for exporters to keep up their market share or increase exports.  The recession hitting many countries throughout the EU has also affected our exports.  This means a reduction in profits which means a reduction in corporation tax and other taxes being received by the Government.The construction industry has almost come to a halt in the past year or two, reducing from approximately 85,000 to 90,000 units to a projection of approximately 35,000 for this year.  A reduction of every 10,000 units means a reduction of 1% of GDP.  From a 6% growth rate last year, we are at a rate below zero this year.In light of this, the funding available to the Government this year was nothing like what it had been in previous years.  Despite this, the Government decided on three priority areas which it must ensure are looked after.  The social welfare budget increased by 8.4%, the education budget by 2.7% and the health budget by more than 2%.  We have always concentrated on these areas, even in the most difficult times, to ensure social welfare recipients, the elderly and those in education are looked after.The budget allocates €515 million to social welfare.  This level of social welfare expenditure indicates the Government's priority to protect and satisfactorily provide for social welfare recipients.  Day to day social welfare expenditure predominantly benefits the elderly and children.  The budget provides for an increase of €2 billion in expenditure in 2009.  These positive changes propose an increase of €7 per week for people in receipt of a State pension in their own right, an extra €6.30 per week for the qualified adults of State pensioners aged 66 years and over and an extra €4.70 for contributory qualified adults under 66 years of age.When the budget was announced we listened to scaremongering that older people would not be looked after, particularly with regard to the Christmas bonus.  It was made clear that the Christmas bonus would be granted this year and I am delighted the Minister has announced it.  In addition, the free fuel allowance has been increased by €2 per week and it has been extended by two weeks.  The Minister is to be commended for listening to Deputies from all sides of both Houses who made the case for an increase in the free fuel allowance, particularly given the change in climate whereby the winter tends to be longer than it used to be.I heard Opposition Members state the increase in the social welfare package does not sufficiently match the increase in inflation.  This is not true because the projected rate of inflation for 2009 is between 2% and 2.5%.  The budget provides for increases of between 3% and 4% in the basic payment rate.  These payment increases are in line with wage rises agreed by the social partners in the second phase of the national pay agreement.  The 2008 social welfare increases far exceed the increase in the consumer price index.All of us have been visited by and have met constituents and we have heard about people who fly in from various parts of the world every month to collect their social welfare and fly out again.  I do not want to mention any nationalities but we have also heard about people who leave the country and give their PPS numbers to other people who work here.  I know the Department of Social and Family Affairs has taken this seriously and has put measures in place to ensure these scams cannot be carried out in future.In this day and age, it is important to ask people who complain about this to provide details, as I do, so the information can be passed on to the Department.  Once the information is provided the Department will carry out examinations.  It is incumbent on all public representatives to put that message across to our constituents and to encourage them to provide us with solid information, rather than pub talk, so any abuses can be dealt with.I welcome the decision to treat husbands and wives equally for pension purposes, particularly in the case of farmers and sole traders.  Heretofore, one spouse, usually the wife, was not treated as a person in his or her own right for the purposes of pension entitlement even though he or she may have worked as hard as the other spouse in the family business.  I am pleased the Minister has seen fit to correct this anomaly.The proposal to cut child benefit by half in 2009 for children aged 18 years and over and to eliminate it in 2010 for this age group has caused great concern.  It is important to reiterate the points made by the Minister in this regard.  In her speech yesterday, she said:Special alleviating measures are being introduced in respect of children aged 18 years who are in social welfare-dependent families or low-income families.  A compensatory payment of €15 per week will be paid to families in receipt of social welfare payments which include a payment for a qualified child in this age group and to low-income families in receipt of family income supplement which include qualified children in this age group.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The Minister went on to say:This additional payment will also be applicable where an 18 year old is in receipt of disability allowance in his or her own right.  Compensatory payments will be paid to the person who was receiving the child benefit for the 18 year old in question.  In addition, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will be increased by €215 to €520 per annum for eligible 18 year olds.It is important to rectify the impression being given that no parent of a child of 18 years or older will be entitled to any type of child benefit payment.  As the Minister indicated, those who are dependent on social welfare will receive additional benefits.The Minister also spoke at length on the role of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Combat Poverty Agency.  Again, the message has gone out that these agencies will be disbanded and their staff let go.  That is incorrect.  This Bill will amend the Citizens Information Acts 2002 to 2007 so as to enhance the functions of the Citizens Information Board through the assignment to it of a responsibility for the provision of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  MABS staff provide a highly valuable service to people who are in debt and who need help and advice in coping with debt problems.I can testify to the usefulness of the service provided by MABS, having put several constituents in touch with it.  On all occasions, the advice provided was very welcome and helpful.  We must ensure the necessary supports are in place for the staff in these agencies.  Under the proposed new structure, advice will be available to them which is not available today.  It is important also to point out that the status of the 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management will not be changed.  Nor will the employment status of the 240 employees who provide the local services.  These people are not in danger of losing their jobs as a result of the provisions in this Bill.The Bill imposes certain curtailments in respect of such payments as jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit and health and safety benefit.  Currently, people who have paid just 52 weekly contributions in total qualify without restriction for these benefits.  The Bill proposes that these benefits can be claimed for 12 months, after which claimants must move onto a means test basis.  Under the current illness benefit procedure, by contrast, welfare is provided without time limitations.  A forthcoming OECD review identifies this provision as unusual across the OECD, and for good reason.  As the report observes, there is a great risk that people in such circumstances will never return to the labour force.  Therefore, the Government's proposed changes seek to provide an incentive for recipients to seek re-employment and to discourage advantageous welfare dependency.Illness benefit is designed to provide income replacement for insured persons during short spells of incapacity or illness.  It is important to note that other payments are available to people who must remain out of employment for a long period because of a disability or medical condition.  However, given that there is currently no limit on the amount of time for which illness benefit can be paid to people who have more than 260 social insurance contributions, more than 28,000 persons have been receiving the payment for more than two years.  The Government has decided to change the entitlement to illness benefit to two years' duration for claims arising after 5 January 2009.  However, existing claimants will not be affected and their conditions will continue under the current guidelines unless they cease claiming for more than three days, wherein the new rules will apply.Existing schemes such as the back-to-work and back-to-education schemes which are aimed at people in receipt of illness benefit for two years or more will continue as before as an incentive for recipients to return to the job market.  If the employment is not successful and claimants return to illness benefit within 26 weeks, they will retain their previous entitlement to illness benefits.  Existing arrangements for claimants who avail of the carer's allowance will also be maintained.  Again, it is important to get the message across that people are not being thrown to the wolves and that benefits remain available to them.The Minister has amended the previous decision on changes to the domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance.  The initial proposal was to extend the age requirement in both cases from 16 years to 18 years for new claimants.  I understand these changes were proposed by some within the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies who deemed the age for receipt of domiciliary allowance to be too low.  They observed that it offered no incentive to children to pursue work or education options and might encourage them to "fall into the dependency trap too early".

The decision of the Minister to change the original announcement was taken following representations from Deputies on all sides of the House and as a result of further recommendations from the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The Minister has suspended the proposals and stated that she will discuss with the relevant groups how their concerns can be addressed.In conclusion, I welcome the Bill.  It is a balanced measure in these difficult times.  When the economy improves again, the difficult decisions that were taken will be reviewed.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I wish to share time with Deputy Pat Breen.Deputy Ahern mentioned that the Minister was following in the footsteps of her predecessors.  What a terrible shock it must have been for the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to take office in the Department of Social and Family Affairs at a time when these crude and vicious cuts were introduced in the budget.  I am sorry the Minister is not present.  This budget appears to target young people in particular.  Deputy Ahern mentioned one of the U-turns by the Minister.  We welcome that because it was a severe and devastating measure for the many people and households affected, particularly the poor.The budget did not protect the vulnerable.  On numerous occasions we have heard Ministers and backbenchers claim that the old, young and the vulnerable will be protected.  That appears to have gone out the door in the 2009 budget.  The working poor are a new phenomenon in Irish society.  There was a time when people believed that when one had a job, one could be secure and have a reasonable standard of living.  That is no longer the case.  Even people on the basic minimum wage will get a wallop from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the inclusion of the 1% levy.  To be fair, she changed her mind a little on that, when she realised the mood of people outside the House.To return to the situation of the young, the Minister said that many of the measures in the budget were a bid to stamp out the dependency culture, especially among young people.  That is when we realised she had targeted the young.  There are many changes with regard to people who have been in employment for one year.  She targeted them in particular.  If somebody lost their job after one year, they were always entitled to get the jobseekers allowance for one year.  The Minister said the budgetary measures are expected to generate €62.7 million in savings next year and €119 million in 2010 and after.  She said that someone who had only been working for one year could get benefit for a year, and that she was not sure it was in the best interests of young workers, who should be encouraged to keep working: "We do not want them to develop a dependency on social welfare payments.  My over-riding consideration would be to ensure we do not create a dependency culture on social welfare, particularly among young workers."That is a terrible indictment of young people, especially today when many young people who only gained employment in the good times now find themselves the first to be told there is no more employment for them.  The Minister is targeting those people.  If that is not bad enough, she has provided a second blow by restricting their return into education.  She will not let them back into education unless they have spent a full 12 months on unemployment benefit but she is also saying they should not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance after one year of work.  How can she reconcile the two positions?  The Minister of State should bring this double whammy to her attention.  They are irreconcilable for young people.  It is a sad indictment of a Minister who was previously responsible for the Department of Education and Science and who should have known better with regard to efforts to get young people to return to education.There is a series of measures from the Minister.  Small, simple things have happened.  The consequence of her anti-youth attitude is a doubling to 104 of the number of contributions necessary to apply for jobseeker's and other allowances.  There is a reduction in jobseeker's benefit from 15 months to 12 months for those with over 260 contributions and from 12 months to nine months otherwise.  Everything is targeted at this group.  I am not sure if she is like the many other Ministers in the Cabinet who are being presented with measures that they have not screened and who have not realised what their impact will be on the public.  All Ministers have done this but very few have been so particularly focused on disadvantaging young people.The budget has caused much agony to many people but I wish to focus on the issue of lone parents and child poverty.  Lone parents constitute a quarter of all families in Ireland today, and 21% of children live in lone parent households.  One parent families, particularly those relying on social welfare or low paid jobs, struggle to cope with the cost of living.  Lone parent households experienced the highest levels of consistent poverty in 2006 at 32.5%.  Children who grow up in poor households are at very high risk of living in poverty as adults.  There is no need to emphasise further the reality of the consequences and difficulties for single parents and their children unless they are supported by the State.Unfortunately, children from these families are the first to drop out of the education system.  If they do drop out, a difficult life lies ahead of them.  The tragedy is that many of them fall away from normal living, as we would call it, and get involved in crime and other social difficulties.  That is rampant in many areas of the country.  There has been a failure to recognise this.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs should recognise the overall cost and that there could be a dividend later on.  Costs associated with rehabilitation, crime, policing and anti-social behaviour will arise later for many of these children, which is tragic.  It is a mistake to claim there will be short-term savings of €62 million next year and €119 million from 2010 onwards.  These are short-term gains to provide emergency funding, but we will pay a higher price later on.  Lives are being destroyed also.I refer to the cutbacks in the school books grant under the budget.  It is all the more tragic that a former Minister for Education and Science will implement these cutbacks.  There will be serious consequences arising from the withdrawal of this grant.  Community education and other services delivered by vocational education committees and other educational bodies will suffer.  The poor and the vulnerable have been targeted again.  These allowances meant a great deal to many families and children.  I cannot understand how a former Minister for Education and Science could target those aspects of education assistance designed to help keep so many people in the education system.  It is unbelievable that the Minister could implement these severe cuts.  I hope at this late stage that the Minister's conscience can alert her to these consequences and she will withdraw from making some of the drastic cuts.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I remind the Ministers of State present, namely Deputies Máire Hoctor and John McGuinness, of the comments of the Minister for Finance on budget day.  He said that spending would be concentrated on schools, health services and the protection of the elderly and the most vulnerable, and the Government side of the House applauded him for these words.  The Minister of States' colleagues in the Government have failed to live up to these words.The decision to withdraw the automatic right to a medical card for the over 70s sparked the most remarkable mobilisation of elderly people in memory.  The only reason there was a climbdown on this issue was because of the sizeable protest on Kildare Street.  I applaud these people for their actions, but this should never have happened.  No matter how the Government tries to dress it up, the universal right to a medical card for the over 70s has been withdrawn.  People who have worked hard all their lives and contributed so much to the country were forced to walk the streets in protest.  This is a terrible way to treat our elderly people.  Many questions still have to be answered, including the matter of the commitment to index link the income limits to inflation.  I appeal to the Minister to rethink this decision.The attack on the elderly in the budget however did not stop at the medical cards.  Many Deputies have already referred to the €7 increase in the old age pension, most of which has been wiped out by inflation and cost of living increases.  Consider what €7 could buy today.  A shopping basket containing milk, a loaf of bread, a bag of sugar and tea bags costs in excess of €7.  People must also buy basic essentials such as meat and vegetables in addition to these goods.  How much of a difference does €7 make?  I suggest it makes no difference at all because such people will still be short of money.The fuel allowance will increase by €2 per week from January.  While I welcome that the allowance has been extended from 30 to 32 weeks starting in April 2009, the increase is inadequate.  The cost of home heating oil has risen by 47% in the 12 months to May this year.  According to Age Action Ireland, an increase in the fuel allowance by €12 is required to cover 70% of fuel costs for an elderly person compared to the current figure of 42%.  Many elderly people will cut down on fuel consumption and will not light the fire as early as they might wish.The Government should come clean and state it will not achieve the goals in the programme for Government, one of which is a commitment to have a State pension of at least €300 per week by 2012.  This will not happen.  The budget does not contain a single proposal to deal with our spiralling unemployment figures.  The latest Central Statistics Office figures reveal the total number signing on for unemployment or social welfare credits has reached 260,000, which is the highest level since March 1997.  In my constituency, County Clare, some 1,539 workers have lost their jobs since the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, took office.  In the past 12 months unemployment has soared by 57% in County Clare with a 74.6% increase in the number of people under 25 years of age signing on.  Many young people see no employment and no future here and decide to go to Australia, although not by choice.  Last week the Schwarz Pharma company based in Shannon, a very good company that has invested much money in the area, announced 55 job losses.  This is only the tip of the iceberg and there will be more job losses in the region.  Many garage forecourts are filled with unsold cars and these firms may go out of business.One of the greatest challenges nowadays for families is meeting the costs of daily living and coping with cost increases in food, heat and children's education.  Many families will also find it difficult to keep up with mortgage repayments.  As unemployment surges many families will be crying out for help.  Between the end of 2007 and October 2008 the number of people in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances increased by 50%.  The situation is especially acute for lower income families in which one spouse is working for low pay and the other has been made redundant.  I have already witnessed an increase in the number of people visiting my constituency office to seek help and we will see more in the coming months.  I urge the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to support the Fine Gael proposal and double emergency support for debt-distressed homeowners to €30 million.  This money could be channelled through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service centres and community welfare officers.The banks must also bear a share of the responsibility.  They loaned money as if it was confetti at a wedding.  Providing 100% mortgages was the norm.  "Negative equity" has become the new buzz word but many of us know of people who bought houses at inflated prices and who have been made redundant in recent times.  Such people cannot afford monthly mortgage repayments and many are in the process of returning the keys of their houses and moving into rented accommodation.  The banks must play a role by negotiating in a fair manner with the families who are experiencing difficulties.The increase in the live register figures means more and more people are now applying for the jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.  It is bad enough that these people have lost their jobs, but they are penalised further by having to wait seven weeks to have their applications processed.  I hope the Minister will examine this matter.  I have been inundated recently with queries from many people who have lost their jobs in the construction industry.  Such people now have no income whatsoever and do not qualify for assistance.  Something should be done for these people too.According to the European Union survey on income and living conditions, published by the Central Statistics Office in 2006, persons living in households where the head of household was unemployed — some 60.8% — were most at risk of poverty.  By failing to deal with these issues more and more people will struggle to make ends meet.I welcome the Minister's decision, although it is a U-turn, to abandon the proposal to raise the eligibility criteria for entitlement to the disability allowance from 16 to 18 years of age for new claimants.  Withdrawing this payment in the first place was shortsighted and would have put extra financial pressures on many families.  This payment is crucial in opening the door for these young people with disabilities and to other services and allowing them to have a greater amount of freedom with dignity.  For example, on receipt of this payment recipients are awarded a travel pass for themselves and a companion for bus and train journeys and a mobility allowance is also provided to enable the person to pay for taxi fares or to travel to hospital.The greatest failure in the area of social welfare is the ongoing neglect and inability to recognise the valuable role of carers in our communities.  Family carers contribute over €2.5 billion to State coffers each year.  According to the 2006 census, there are 4,507 carers in County Clare alone, working a total of 99,660 hours per week.  One in six of our carers still do not qualify for the carer's allowance and there is no sign of a national carers strategy, which was promised by the end of 2007.  It is ridiculous at this stage that an individual assessment for the carer's allowance means test is not acceptable and that the carer's partner's income continues to be assessed to qualify the carer for the payment.  The Minister must take steps to have this matter addressed.Poverty is a human ill and we must fight it together.  However, there is no fight left in this Government.  The recent budget is a testament to this.  It was an uncaring and savage attack on the most vulnerable people in society.  The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 is another missed opportunity to reduce the increasing gap between rich and poor.  The most marginalised in this country have been asked to pay the price for ten years of neglect by the Government.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I am delighted to contribute to this debate.  I understand we are talking about the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  In very difficult economic circumstances, the social welfare budget for 2009 is €19.6 billion, a 15.5% increase from 2008.  I cannot understand how that is described as savage and vicious.  It was a remarkable achievement for the Government to come out with that package for social welfare dependants in these difficult times.  How could an increase of €2.6 billion be savage and vicious?  These were the words used by Opposition Deputies.  They feel that if they keep on saying those words, somebody will finally think there is something wrong with billions of euro.  It is the most extraordinary commentary I have ever heard.  One of the previous speakers spoke about the money for back-to-school allowances, but this amount has been increased enormously.  How is that savage and vicious?I deal with a great many people every weekend who want quicker access to their benefits, and who seek advice on their entitlements.  Therefore, I know what I am talking about, no matter what anybody says to the contrary.  I must praise the people who work in social welfare offices around the country and how quickly they respond when we ask parliamentary questions.  I refer in particular to the child benefit section in the office in Letterkenny, which responds within 24 hours.  One of the benefits of being a Deputy is that we can bring solace and comfort when we get a reply.  Of course, that only happens when the reply is good.  When I was in the Seanad, we did not have that benefit and I missed it greatly.  The people in the section in Letterkenny and in other sections should be praised for the way they attend to their jobs.Family income supplement, FIS, is a benefit that is not publicised well enough and people do not get full access to it.  There is not a week that goes by when I ask somebody whether they have thought of applying for FIS.  They rarely know what it is, but when I explain it to them and they give me some of their details, I tell them that I think they would qualify.  A snappy advertising campaign should be conducted to promote this.  There used to be such campaigns before, but I have not seen any sign of it lately.  A snappy advertising of FIS is necessary so people on low incomes know there is help at hand.  As far as I know, there have been increases in FIS, so more people should avail of it.  However, there is a need for it to be publicised.The carer's allowance is where the greatest disparity occurs in the judgments made on those who have applied for it.  No matter what evidence is produced in support of the person applying for the allowance, it is disallowed.  One has the right to appeal, but I have never seen an appeal succeed in over 20 years of public life.  The exact same result occurs every time.  We do not know the criteria involved, although I think there is an adjudicating officer and an appeals officer.  The appeal wends its way upwards and backwards, but the result is always the same.  I have had to appeal to the Ombudsman on a particular case about the disallowance of a carer's allowance.  The case is clearcut to me, as the documentary evidence includes signed affidavits.  The lady for whom the carer was caring has subsequently passed away, but that does not take away from the fact that she was denied the carer's allowance for two years.  I do not know the grounds on which the appeal was turned down, and I simply cannot understand it.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service does enormous good, and it has taken many decent people out of a financial hole that was not of their own making.  The service is clear, clinical and kind, and its staff get at the problems and make sure the people seeking its advice know what they are about.  They set up a budgetary system and visit those to whom the people owe money.  They set out an agenda for payments to which the people involved can adhere.  They see a way through the fog, where previously there was no way through.The Minister has brought forward a range of improvements in the Bill.  State pensioners are to receive €7 extra per week.  I heard the previous speaker say that was nothing, but that is not so because people are appreciative of the increase.  We know it is all taxpayers' money but in a time of desperate economic straits they were glad to see such an increase — an extra €2 on the fuel allowance with two weeks extra at the end of April.  All these increases begin in January.  I well remember that when we came back into Government in 1997, many of these payments were being paid from April and June of the following year, which is quite ridiculous if they should be in play for a budget year.  However, there have been improvements in how such things are set out.According to the statistics, 18,000 more families are now becoming eligible for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  How can that be savage and vicious, which is what a previous speaker said?  The figure is above what was eligible prior to that.  I often meet with families who feel they should be eligible, but when one goes through it, sadly, they are not.  Be that as it may, however, that is the extra number.I wish to make a few general points.  While I do not mean this unkindly on the two gentlemen who are occupying the Fine Gael front bench at the moment, they must feel all their Christmases have come together.  All they have to do is put down a motion on whatever is the "scandal" of the week before.  I do not mean to use that word in a scandalous sense——

Will everything they espouse from the Opposition benches be part of their manifesto?  Methinks not.  I noted an important point during the debate on the medical card issue or the education cuts, I am not sure which.  Deputy Richard Bruton, Fine Gael's spokesman on finance, did not utter a word during the whole debate.  That is because he is being kept in cold storage, wrapped in cotton wool in case he might have to eat his words in ten, 12, 14 or 18 years time, whenever they come into Government.  It may be months, I do not know.

Just before attending the House at 5.30 p.m., I had a phone call from the principal of a secondary school in my constituency.  He told me he will manage the pupil-teacher ratio by rearranging the timetable.  He has already had a parents' meeting to explain it to them.  However, he brought one small item to my attention, which I will bring to the Minister of State's attention.  He said "I am bamboozled with telephone calls and emails from the Opposition, both Fine Gael and Labour, telling me to invite parents to protest meetings and to send children home with letters in their satchels about protest meetings, and in general to have a whip-around of incipient rebellion about education".  The Opposition is urging him to do it and will attend any meeting he will arrange on these matters.  Every one of us has had over 800 emails delivered to our offices on the topic which Fine Gael tabled for tonight's debate.  We saw where it was sent to, so clearly there is a unit which is hard at work.  I like active units, but that may be a somewhat pejorative term in light of northern issues.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	674	We often get the impression that it is the Government's money, but the people of Ireland paid in this money.  Literally speaking, it is a totally taxed economy and everybody is taxed indirectly to such an extent.  When one looks at how the €19 billion is spent, one must consider the level of tax taken from welfare benefits.There is no imagination evident in the budget on how to take people away from a dependency on social welfare payments and back into work.  This has been the real missed opportunity.  There is very little difference between welfare and the minimum wage.  There is a 1% increase given to 2.1 million workers and pensioners with non-pension income, child benefit for 18 year olds will be halved in 2009, child care supplement will also be cut and new claimants of jobseeker's benefit will need 104 paid contributions.  These measures, together with the U-turn in the eligibility criteria for entitlement to disability allowance will have an impact on people on very low incomes.The higher VAT rate will have a direct impact.  The high rate of VAT is the biggest contributor to Revenue.  It is also one of the reasons people are travelling to America and Northern Ireland.  The cost of doing business in this country is prohibitive.  Those living in a Border county know that the level of VAT is considerably different on the other side of the Border, as are excise duties.With regard to the role of FÁS and the back to work schemes, there is work to be done in reskilling people so that they can go back into the workforce.  The higher rates of VAT and capital gains tax and the reduction of tax relief on medical expenses are all noted.  The Government was given advice about medical card entitlement in 2001.  The medical card entitlement and its reversal has been a fiasco.I compliment the staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs for their excellent work.  They are clearly people who react quickly to any representation made.I wish to speak about the issue of fuel poverty as it impacts on the older people in the community.  The Government's budget social welfare provisions for fuel allowance for this coming year are completely inadequate to meet the real needs of low income households and older people in particular.  Budget 2009 provides for an increase of €2.20 a week in the fuel allowance with an extension of the winter months to 32 weeks.  That is €640, which is minimal when considering the cost of a tank of oil.The back to education allowance was discussed by other speakers.  The minimum wage is €17,000 a year, which is €346 a week and the social welfare ceiling is €18,000, which is €347 a week, one euro greater.  This difference of €1.21 creates huge disparity in education support for a full-time three-year degree course and it should be reconsidered.  We have no official register of energy poverty so that we do not know the extent of the problem but it is serious.  A total of 227,000 households experience some degree of fuel poverty.This Bill has failed to deliver to the most vulnerable in society, the very young and the very old.  Other Deputies have spoken about the inadequacy of the family income support.  People are expected to live on €200 a week.  The cost of living is rising every day and this has an impact on the weekly shopping bill.  The inflationary increases in the price of oil and increases in electricity charges have a direct impact on people's ability to manage their household budget.  The Combat Poverty Agency has been amalgamated with another body and this will also have a direct impact.  An opportunity has been missed.  The sum of €19 billion is a huge amount of money.  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and his special reports on certain aspects of the budget.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I will refer to a number of specific aspects of the budget.  The failure to increase child benefit payments means that the value of this payment will fall by 2.5% in real terms in 2009 and this will have a negative effect on the households of the working poor.  Even with the changes introduced in the family income supplement, many working poor households will see their standard of living fall in 2009.  As a result of the changes introduced in the budget, there will be no reduction in Ireland's extensive child poverty.  I refer to work carried out by CORI on the analysis of the budget in which this issue was emphasised more than any other aspect of the budget.The social welfare increases are to be welcomed to some extent.  However, as CORI and others have pointed out, the increases were fairly minimal when one considers an increase for a single person by just €6.50 a week and €10.80 for a couple and for those on State pensions an increase of €7 a week for a single person and €11.60 for a couple.  These are very small in the context of the increases in food prices evident in supermarkets.  The UK inflation rate is currently 5.6% and there is a likelihood it will continue to increase here.  This will dilute the increases allocated in the budget, however welcome.Fuel poverty was referred to by Deputy Perry.  The Institute for Public Health conducted an excellent study on fuel poverty entitled, Fuel Poverty and Health, which highlighted the sizeable direct and indirect effects on health of fuel poverty.  This study found that fuel poverty on the island of Ireland remains unacceptably high and that it is responsible for the highest levels of excess winter mortality in Europe, with an estimated 2,800 excess deaths on the island of Ireland over the winter months.  Older people in particular need at least one hot meal a day and they need to keep warm.  In many cases they cannot afford to buy oil or other fuel and so their houses and clothes remain cold and damp.  I know from personal experience that this has a bearing on the state of their health.There was an increase of just €2 per week on the back of the Fuel, Poverty and Health study despite a very strong lobby by CORI and others, including a motion in the House, and a strong demand that it should be increased.  This fell on deaf ears as €2 is rather derisory in the context of what these people need.  While I accept the payment was extended by two weeks, given the weather conditions and temperature levels in this country at present it should be extended to 40 weeks as it is needed most of the year.  This should be a consideration for next year.  It is very important that the Government would continue to increase the amount of the allowance and also the extent of time for which it is paid.An aspect of the budget about which I am particularly concerned is that of the paid contributions required for entitlement to jobseeker's benefit.  As we know, there are 251,000 unemployed at present.  While the Government can rightly take some credit for the fact there are over 2 million people employed, the likelihood is that by this time next year there could be 350,000 unemployed.  Although I hope this will not be case, there will be more people seeking jobseeker's allowance.  The nature of employment may also be increasingly short term.  The increase from 52 contributions to 104 will eliminate many people who are at present entitled to jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit and health and safety benefit.  The Minister should examine this issue when considering Committee Stage and perhaps move half way in this regard.  The change is penal and will affect many.For the first time, there are over 4,000 people signing on at the social welfare office in Tralee but it does not have the staff to cope with the number of applications being submitted.  I would like the Minister to examine the staffing complement and perhaps redeploy staff.  There are major delays in assessing and approving applications at present and I appeal to the Minister to consider this.

When one goes to them on appeal, they are always flexible.  I have never yet met a case where I did not basically agree with the decision they made.  It is an excellent performance.  If other Departments were as accountable, available, approachable and understanding of human nature as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it would be an important day.A number of people have come to my office recently who have no benefits or stamps because they worked in a self-employed capacity in the building industry.  There is a need to do whatever one can but we also need to look to the future and introduce a scheme which would be optional for such people.  While one can have private insurance, many of these are young people who started off in the middle of the boom and while they had an income previously, they now have nothing.  We need to put in place a support system so they might benefit from insurance stamps for the self-employed.  They could make a contribution from their wages, which would give them some assurance, if and when they lose their work, that they will have some kind of income and not be down to nothing.  It is a serious issue.Another issue resulting from the recession relates to people who are in trouble with their mortgages, particularly sub-prime mortgages.  Start Mortgages is a company providing such mortgages, and one I have dealt with personally.  The Minister should be aware that a person came to my office last week to show me a text reading "Final notice" because Start Mortgages had been sending out final notices by text to people who were in trouble with their mortgages.  The company phoned them repeatedly over a period of days to discuss the issues with them.  The problem was that the families involved were paying 8% or 9% interest, which is extremely high and almost double the normal mortgage rate.The interventions that are needed when people get into such difficulties are not available in a structured way.  There is the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which is excellent, but we need to put in place structures so that if people get into mortgage difficulties, support is available early on, when they are, say, €3,000 or €4,000 in arrears.  There needs to be a relationship between the person in trouble, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, MABS and the other relevant housing agencies.  This process should automatically include a referral of the problem to MABS so it can analyse the issues and give good advice, which it always does.The Minister should ensure that Start Mortgages and sub-prime lenders in particular are dealt with.  We need to tell them they cannot just crucify people when they get into difficulties.  Many such people have borrowed beyond their means and most are in negative equity.  We need a structure in place to deal with this.  The other lenders — the banks, the building societies and the fund for distressed mortgage holders — need to be brought into the process, which should be structured so that the families involved are offered choices.People who are harassed, hounded and haunted have come to my office with their problems.  They are in tears because they will lose their homes but it is too late in many cases because the debt is too much at that stage.  Earlier and focused intervention is needed and the banks and building societies must play their part.  They must consider these cases and decide whether, for example, they could offer these people mortgages at 5% if their debt was under €5,000.The situation gets worse and worse for such families.  They get more messages and harassment and end up losing their homes, as we read in the newspapers.  A judge of the High Court recently made some not very complimentary remarks about Start Mortgages and he was right to do so.  In many cases, that company is bleeding people dry when they cannot afford to hold onto their homes and are in total distress.I also wish to raise the issue of fuel poverty and support the point made by Deputy Deenihan.  An analysis was carried out perhaps five years ago with regard to death rates among older people in Norway and Ireland.  While the population base and the climate was much the same in both countries, more older people were dying in Ireland than in Norway.  The reason for this was the thermal efficiency of the homes.  It is not just about the cost of fuel but also about the fuel that goes up the chimney or out the windows and the cracks in the doors.  We need increased support to make homes more thermally efficient, which would make a significant difference, particularly for the elderly.

#ChristyOSullivan	unknown-#ChristyOSullivan-party	unknown-#ChristyOSullivan-dob	unknown-#ChristyOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is of huge importance to the most vulnerable people in our community.  It shows that the Government has the best interests of the less well-off at heart.The Bill provides for an increase of between 3% and 3.8% in basic social welfare payments next year.  This represents a total spend of €19.6 billion for 2009 and an increase of €2.6 billion over the 2008 Estimates.  Overall, 1.7 million people will benefit from these provisions.  This includes 440,000 pensioners, 345,000 ill and disabled people, over 80,000 carers, 30,000 low income families who will be availing of family income supplement and more than 580,000 families who receive child benefit payments.A country can best be judged by how it looks after its most vulnerable, and this Bill shows our country in a very positive light.  In these difficult economic times, it is important that we support those who need it most.  At a time when many pensioners and social welfare recipients were not expecting increases, the Minister has provided just such increases.  Many of these figures are worth repeating.  In the coming year there will be an increase of €7 per week for all State pensioners, contributory and non-contributory, as well carers aged 66 and over.  There will be an increase for qualified adults ranging from €4.30 to €6.30 per week for those over 66 years of age.  A couple will now have a weekly increase of €13.30 per week.  The 11% increase in fuel allowance to €20 a week from the start of 2009 is most welcome. I also welcome that the season has been increased to 32 weeks in total.The Government is doing all it can to keep unemployment as low as possible but it is prudent in the current economic environment to set aside funding in case it continues to rise.  The Bill sees changes to the jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit and health and safety benefit schemes.Some people, who were previously working part-time, could receive a higher rate of payment from these schemes than what they were earning while at work.  This has been recognised as being inappropriate and a disincentive to employment.  From January, this situation will be addressed by increasing the earnings thresholds which currently apply to the reduced or graduated rates of payment from €150 to €300 per week.  This provides an extra incentive for those seeking employment.  Up to 733,000 people are in receipt of working age payments — jobseekers, one-parent families, illness benefit and disability allowance claimants and carers.  They will all benefit from increases in weekly personal rates in the coming year.Unfortunately, in these changed economic times, it has been necessary to take some steps to reduce expenditure.  These have been kept to the minimum and applied in a careful manner.  There was no easy way to achieve the required savings.  Consideration had to be given to a wide range of changes and very difficult decisions had to be made.  No Minister took these decisions lightly.  The Bill seeks to ensure the most needy in our society are looked after and that they are not left behind or forgotten.  I welcome the Bill.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  At a time when we are experiencing very challenging economic times, it is timely to reflect on the social welfare entitlements of those that most need the assistance from the State.The Bill's purpose is to implement the €515 million package of social welfare improvements which were announced in budget 2009.  In a very challenging economic climate, this package will bring total expenditure on social welfare in 2009 to €19.6 billion, a substantial increase over the Estimates allocation for 2008.  At a time of depleting Government resources, this increased provision for social welfare is a clear and timely signal of the Government's commitment to protect the older people, those losing their jobs and other vulnerable and less well-off in society.  Given the financial restrictions, however, the budget has some concrete and helpful proposals to protect the less well-off.  It proposes an increase of €7 per week for recipients of pensions and carer payments who are aged 66 years and over.  There will be an increase of €6.50 on all working age payments, including jobseeker's benefit, disability allowance, one-parent family payment and carer's benefit and allowance payable to carers aged under 66 years.The budget also provides for an 11% increase in the value of the fuel allowance for our older people. The fuel allowance will be €20 per week from next January.  The duration of the fuel season is also being extended by another two weeks from April 2009, bringing it to 32 weeks in total.  As oil prices have significantly reduced in recent months, the increased fuel allowance will be all the more effective.  The improvements to the fuel scheme will benefit nearly 300,000 households.Since 2004, the Government has increased the budget for services for older people by €540 million.  In budget 2009, €55 million will be provided to implement the fair deal while protecting the home help and home care services.  It is also important to point out that over 50,000 elderly people were taken out of the tax net between 2003 and 2007.The budget provides an extra €260 million for social welfare payments to people of working age.  The maximum personal rate of payment for all working age schemes is being increased by €6.50 per week with effect from the first week of January 2009, with proportionate increases applying to people on reduced rates.  This brings the lowest social welfare weekly payments above €200 for the first time to €204.30.  The rates of qualified adult payments are also being increased on all schemes by €4.30, except for the invalidity pension scheme where a €4.60 increase will apply.  Approximately 733,000 people will benefit from these increases.Budget 2009 also provides increases for families with children who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  Social welfare-dependent parents currently receive an extra €24 per week for each child, on top of their basic social welfare payments through the qualified child increase.  This will be increased by €2 to €26 per child with effect from January 2009.  Improvements are also being made to the family income supplement which is paid to low-income working families.  The income limits for the family income supplement are being increased by €10 per week in respect of each child giving an average extra payment of €6 per child per week.  It is estimated that a total of 29,000 families will benefit from the supplement in 2009 and that approximately 2,000 additional families will become eligible for payment.  The income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance will also be increased to enable 18,000 more families to benefit from the scheme.I wish to highlight the work of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  Its staff provide a highly valued service to people who are in need of advice on financial issues and are over-indebted.  Such people need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management, employing 240 nationwide that provide local services.  I urge anyone who needs assistance to call to their local MABS office where they will get free advice on their financial situation.The Bill will provide the legislative basis for a range of improvements next year.  These include €7 extra per week for State pensioners; €6.50 extra per week for welfare recipients of working age, such as jobseekers and those on illness benefit; an extra €2 per week on the fuel allowance, with payment also being made for an additional two weeks; increases in child-related payments to those dependent on social welfare; improvements in the family income supplement for low-income working families; and 18,000 more families becoming eligible for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  I commend the Bill to the house.

It is an attack on the most vulnerable in society.  Those who can least afford it are being made to pay for the failed economic policies of successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments for over a decade.Make no mistake about it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the hardship now faced by the unemployed, by those dependent on social welfare, by older people and by children has come about not as a result of a world slump but because of a home-grown recession.  A thriving economy was built by Irish workers in the mid-1990s.  The basis for sustainable growth was laid.  Fianna Fáil-led Governments from 1997 had it in their power to invest in sound infrastructure, develop efficient and equitable public services, foster industry to provide employment and raise revenue through exports to create an enhanced society as well as a prosperous economy.What did they do instead?  They saw a growing economy and decided, along with their friends the developers, the speculators and the bankers, to reap the rewards through ruthlessly exploiting the increased demand for housing and commercial property.  They created a massive property bubble and a perilous over-dependence on construction for employment.  The result is all too plain to see.  The bubble has burst.  Construction employment has collapsed.  Government revenue has gone through the floor.  Families are mortgaged to the hilt and many are losing their homes.  Negative equity is rife and the full consequences for individuals, families, companies and financial institutions have yet to be seen.All of this was predictable.  Sinn Féin and others on the left in this House, as well as independent economists and social commentators, constantly highlighted the folly and injustice of Government economic policy.  Introducing the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, said the Government "has had to make some difficult decisions in order to secure our economic future".  The right decisions should have been made a long time ago.  The Government of which the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has been a member for eight years has made the wrong decisions.  Collectively, it has squandered the boom and now it is making the poor pay for its folly.In August, an all-Ireland study on health and equality was published by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland and the Combat Poverty Agency, the latter of which the Government is now silencing.  The report showed that in the 26 counties, 38% of those at risk of poverty — that is, living on an income of less than €202.50 per week — reported suffering from a chronic illness, compared to 23% of the general population.  In the Six Counties, 47% of unskilled workers suffer from long-standing illness compared to 30% of professionals and managers.  Budget 2009 and this social welfare Bill will result in even deeper health inequalities in this State.  The incomes of low paid workers, the unemployed and a whole range of people dependent on social welfare will clearly suffer.The Bill is especially mean-spirited in its attack on the benefits available for the masses of people becoming unemployed.  The October 2008 live register and the seasonally adjusted figures for people signing on were up by a massive 57%, or 94,800, compared to October 2007.  Redundancy figures were up 50% on October last year to an all time high of 32,076 or 729 per week.  More than a quarter of a million people are now unemployed.  Against this background, incredibly, the Government is actually cutting benefits for the unemployed.  People will now need to have been employed for two years to qualify for jobseeker's benefit.  The payment period for this benefit has been shortened from 15 months to 12 months, after which the unemployed person must to drop to the means tested jobseeker's allowance.Can the Minister or any of her backbenchers put themselves in the position of a young construction worker, unemployed for the first time, with a young family and a mortgage?  Can any of them imagine the plight of that young person?  That worker now faces the shock of the dole queue, reduced social welfare benefits, price inflation, higher costs for health care and few prospects for employment in the short or medium term.  This Government's policy has created unemployment and now it is penalising the unemployed.  Shame on it.The minimum adult social welfare increase of €6.50 to €204.30 is wiped out by inflation and is, in effect, a cut.  The same goes for the paltry €7 per week increase in pensions, while the living alone allowance has not been increased at all.  The €2 increase in fuel allowance can be seen as nothing short of an insult.  So much for the Government's claimed special concern for older people.  We saw the hypocrisy of that claim in the removal of the automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over 70s, which has been long debated in this House.  Another especially mean-spirited cut is the ending of child benefit for 18 year olds.  This will hit low income families most badly and will have the effect of driving many young people out of education.  For an 18 year old, child benefit can make the difference between continuing in education, albeit with a real struggle, and being unable to continue due to the inability of the family to support the young person through that vital year.  I have no doubt this measure will result in reduced numbers completing the leaving certificate.  Young people from low income families will be going into a depressed employment market without basic qualifications.  It is another extremely damaging and therefore short-sighted measure.  Low-income families, especially those just above the poverty line and those who do not qualify for medical cards, will be especially badly hit by the 1% income levy.  The VAT increase will also have a disproportionately adverse effect on these families.The Society of St. Vincent de Paul reports that 800 people attended a crisis meeting of the organisation in Dublin last weekend to discuss how to cope with what it has described as a "soaring demand" — I repeat, a soaring demand — for its services.  Calls for help have increased by almost 40% since last year.  The society is an independent charity, so at least it is somewhat insulated from the ravages of the Government.  These include the effective abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency, which has done so much to highlight the inequalities sponsored and presided over by this Government over many years and to advocate sounder policies which this Government has patently ignored.This social welfare Bill is totally unacceptable and Sinn Féin will reject it at every turn.

Any legislation or debate on social welfare is important, especially in recessionary times.  It is also crucial in terms of how we treat the most vulnerable in our society.  That is the key to this debate.  I accept that we live in difficult times, but we all have a civic and political duty to support those on social welfare and particularly the weakest sections of society.  That is my brief in the Dáil as an Independent Deputy and that is the agenda I have been pushing in the Dáil.  I am not going to walk away from those on social welfare, from our senior citizens or from our children in large classes.In this discussion of the poorer sections of society in disadvantaged areas, I would like to point out that most people in poor areas do not get involved in crime.  This is very relevant to the debate and also in the context of the recent horrific murder of Shane Geoghegan in Limerick.  I offer my deepest sympathy to his family today and say loud and clear that this terrible, savage murder is not acceptable in any State, any area or any community.  Brutality such as this is simply not on and I urge everyone to speak out.For 25 years I worked in a disadvantaged area in which many families were dependent on social welfare, and the vast majority were not involved in crime and murder.  It is important to say that in this debate because some communities are regularly labelled in a negative way.  In fact, I would say to the middle classes and the wealthy who take or deal in cocaine that they are a major part of the problem.  By feeding their habits they are looking after the market.  I urge them to see common sense and realise the connection between their social habits and the murders on our streets today.With regard to this Bill, we need to look at the facts and consider social welfare in the context of the real world.  I welcome the positive aspects of the Bill but, overall, there are many negative aspects.  While almost all groups, including people depending on social welfare payments, have experienced an increase in income, the pattern of income distribution has continued to be characterised by a high degree of inequality.Ireland's income distribution has remained much more unequal than that of any other European state.  In terms of unequal distribution, Ireland tops the list.  As overall personal wealth grew during the boom, the reality of the extreme concentration of this wealth was often obscured.  In 2006, some 20% of the wealth of this country was held by 1% of the population.  When the wealth arising from the ownership of a home was excluded the degree of concentration was even greater, with 1% of the population owning 34% of household wealth.  Where credit was vigorously marketed by financial institutions, many people met rising living standards expectations by entering into high levels of personal debt, often by availing of unsolicited loans.  It is important in this debate that we mention the fact that many banks have been ripping people off for many years.House building reached record levels but the price of housing increased, locking many out of a chance of becoming home owners and others into ownership on the basis of costly and extended mortgages, often for homes far from their workplaces.  There were lengthy waiting lists for social housing.  By 2005 this stood at 43,000 households as against 27,000 in 1996, an increase of 52%.  Many times more houses were built as second or holiday homes or as investments than were built for social housing.Although there were improvements in emergency services, some homeless people were unable to obtain emergency accommodation or felt they would be unsafe in the accommodation offered, and so remain on the streets.  Even when emergency homeless services responded adequately, as they frequently did, the shortage of social housing and the cost of private rented accommodation made it very difficult for people to move on to a permanent home.Significant increases in public expenditure on health services failed to make up for the deficits of years of under-investment and many people continue to be denied services or experience long delays in accessing them.  However, the Government failed to seize the opportunity presented by economic prosperity to begin to change the inherently unjust structure of a two-tier health system, which I have for many years pushed for in the Dáil.  This has a directly negative impact on all those on social welfare.Despite the many positive developments in the education system, such as inclusion initiatives to address educational disadvantage, stark differences in educational outcomes persist for many children, especially from the poorest areas.  I mention this because promised reductions in class size were only partially fulfilled and in recent weeks we have seen what is happening.  We must reassert the importance of the values of social solidarity, fairness and compassion.  That is the key matter regarding this legislation.The Bill provides for increases in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments and improvements in family income supplements.  It also provides for certain amendments to the social welfare code, as announced in budget 2009, including to PRSI.  The Bill further provides for amendments to other Acts, including the Pensions Acts 1990-2007, the Civil Registration Act 2004 and the Citizens Information Acts 2000-07.  In Part 2, amendments to the Social Welfare Acts, sections 3 and 4 provide for increases in the rates of social welfare payments and these include an increase of €7 per week for recipients of pensions.  This increase is unacceptable.Some other Deputies have said this is an excellent budget but let them examine the facts, the detail and how it was handled.  They should ask the elderly, disabled and social welfare recipients how they feel about the budget.  I want to deal with the domiciliary care allowance issue.  I was one of those who lobbied the Minister hard for days.  She listened to the submissions on the domiciliary care allowance and climbed down in the end.  She also had the opportunity to listen to Down Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland and many other Deputies who pushed this issue.  It is important that people realise putting on pressure delivers results, as we have seen on many other issues.The National Council for the Blind is extremely disappointed the Government has failed to adequately protect the interests of blind and vision impaired people in the recent budget.  In its pre-budget submissions it made the case for above-inflation rises to a range of benefits and allowances that would protect the people it works with from the spiralling costs of inflation.  Although this is a key issue, there is no talk in this debate on inflation.  With 50% of those the council works with over the age of 65, the withdrawal of the medical card for the over 70s was clearly a major concern for many blind people and legislators.  Although the increase in the thresholds announced on 21 October will ensure that 95% of that population retain this key benefit, the concern and confusion caused by the controversy unsettled many people and caused them unnecessary worries about the affordability of their health care.  This is particularly relevant to people with disabilities.The National Council for the Blind also perceives a similar tampering with the medical card scheme benefits between local areas throughout the country.  Some HSE regions refuse to pay for vital low-vision aids while in other HSE areas the same items are covered by the scheme.  A recent report published by the main organisation providing services to blind and visually-impaired people found that 30,000 people in Ireland live with significant sight loss because they wear no prescription glasses or the wrong ones.  This is a national scandal.  With the number of people in Ireland who are blind or visually impaired expected to increase by more than 170% over the next 25 years, it is crucial that the Government encourage and enable people to proactively manage their eyesight and prioritise their eye health.  This will require increased investment and a consistent nationwide approach instead of regional variations.  It is very important I mention these issues.I am fearful that while spending on disability services is being presented as 2% of the total health spending in 2009, in real terms we face a cut of between 4% and 6%.  Cuts at this level are intolerable to our sector, which experienced a reduction in spending of over €31 million last year.  It is impossible for the disability sector to observe a massive cut in funding without its having a significant impact on the quality and availability of services that will provide for those in greatest need of support in the community.It is important we examine the details of the legislation and stand up for the poorer sections of society and those on social welfare.  Society is people.  Without people there is no society.  I urge everybody to join in the attempt to redevelop respect, trust and community spirit by insisting on people-centred policies and actions.  Sadly, this legislation is not in line with that ethos.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I propose to share my time with Deputies Tom Hayes and Feighan.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  Budget 2009 includes no imaginative proposals on how to get people off social welfare and back to work, particularly through retraining and education.  The Bill is a missed opportunity to make changes to the back to education allowance so that people do not have to receive a social welfare payment for 12 months before they can retrain or up-skill.  Presumably, the Government takes the view it costs too much but this is false as it will save money in the long term to see people retrained for the modern economy.A person in a low-income job wishing to return to education is entitled to only €4,131 per year in educational support whereas a person from a social welfare background is entitled to €25,266 per year.  Over a three year degree course this leads to a €63,489 disparity in essential support.  This anomaly limits the incentive for low-paid workers to return to full-time third level education to improve their skills and their future job prospects.People who want to escape the low-pay trap are being penalised for working.  When one takes up a degree course as an adult learner the level of support depends on what one did in the year before taking up the place on the course.  One is disqualified from the back to education allowance if one worked in the year before taking a college place, no matter what the income level.I wish to comment on an issue I have encountered repeatedly in recent times.  I refer to the plight of self-employed people who find themselves out of work.  Last week, I spoke to a small-time self-employed person who has not worked since 20 June last.  When he applied for the jobseeker's allowance, he was refused it.  He has been told he is not entitled to unemployment assistance.  He has a wife, who works at home, and a four year old child.  He does not have any income because he cannot receive supplementary welfare allowance.  Any application for the allowance would be assessed on the basis of his 2006 earnings.The earnings of self-employed people in 2006 are totally different from their earnings for the first six months of 2008.  I suggest that the 2006 income should be totally irrelevant.  The man in question is depending on his extended family to keep him, his wife and his child in food.  Those who are assisting him have indicated that there is a limit to what they can do.  In fairness to them, they have supported him greatly.  When I spoke to community care officials about this case, I was told they cannot do anything about the matter.  They mentioned that they are encountering more and more cases of this type.  It seems that self-employed people and those running small businesses are most likely to be in dire straits.I wish to speak about the bureaucratic problems I encountered when I tried to obtain unemployment assistance for a man.  It would probably be kind to refer to him as semi-literate.  He was unable to provide the level of information required of him, or cope with the level of bureaucracy demanded in his case.  He was unable to obtain supplementary welfare allowance because he had been refused unemployment assistance.  He has been forced to beg on the streets.  The Garda asked him if he would contact community welfare officers, but they were unable to do anything for him.  When he applied for unemployment assistance, he was asked to provide more information.  He did not comprehend what was asked of him and was therefore unable to meet the various requirements.  There must be some way of ensuring that people in such circumstances are helped.  The various bureaucratic limitations in the system should be removed so it can respond to such people.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter.I imagine that the amount of people on non-contributory pensions is small and the people involved are now quite elderly.  I expect that the cost of such pensions is decreasing substantially each year, as a result of the wastage associated with the life cycle.  It would not the cost the State anything to introduce the change I am recommending in this area.  I propose that we should give the few people on the means-tested non-contributory pension who have some means an automatic right to the pension.  Perhaps we can abandon the non-contributory pension in such cases.I refer to people who did not have an opportunity to pay PRSI when they worked up to the age of 65.  The cohort of people who did not have ten years of contributions was initially quite large.  The rules were then changed so that a 50% payment could be made to those with 50% of the necessary contributions.  The Government should recognise that the people in question, who are well into their 80s, have played their part over the years.  It should re-examine the manner in which the non-contributory pension is paid to them.This country's 161,000 carers work 3.7 million hours every week.  It is estimated that their work saves the State €2.5 billion each year.  However, less than one in six carers qualifies for the carer's allowance.  This year's budget provides for a minimal increase in the allowance.  The increase, which barely keeps pace with inflation, will do nothing to help family carers who depend on the allowance to cope with the rising cost of care in the home.  The weekly rate of carer's allowance currently paid to those under the age of 66 is €214, or €4.59 less than the median income poverty line of €218.59.  The Government promised to review supports for family carers in the national strategy for carers, which was supposed to have been published by the end of 2007.  Almost 12 months later, it has not yet been published.It looks increasingly likely that the strategy will be a "yellow pack" document that does not address the key concerns identified by the groups that represent carers.  The groups have called for the role of this country's more than 5,000 young carers to be recognised and supported.  They want adequate income supports to be provided to carers.  They have suggested that carer payments be linked to labour market rates.  The groups want the Government to ensure that the minimum level of carer's allowance is not less than the minimum wage.  They have demanded an adjustment in the income disregard used during the assessment of means for carer's allowance.The carers' groups believe that the individual carer's means should be the only matter considered in the means test.  They are concerned about the rules governing the ability of carers to earn income.  They believe that carers should be permitted to engage in employment for more than 15 hours a week.  The groups argue that PRSI contributions should be awarded to carers on the same basis as paid contributions, so that carers are entitled to the State contributory pension when they become eligible for pension purposes.The 2006 census found that there are 5,433 carers between the ages of 15 and 19 in this country.  Some 700 of the carers in question work between 29 and 43 hours each week.  This year's budget did nothing to recognise the role of such carers.  The Government promised, in the programme for Government agreed last year and the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, that it would publish the national strategy for carers before the end of 2009.  The delay in publishing the strategy clearly demonstrates the political inertia that exists in regard to carers.  It exposes the Government's supposed commitment in this area as no more than lip service to the concerns of carers.  If the Government is unwilling to publish its blueprint for addressing the provision of services, supports and entitlements to carers, it is clear that it is not truly committed to making any real improvement in the lives of carers in the near future.I raised the issue of energy poverty during a Private Members' debate in the House some weeks ago.  There is a strong causal relationship between low incomes, poor housing, energy poverty and adverse health.  One of this country's shortcomings is that it does not have an official register of energy poverty.  Therefore, we do not know the extent of this problem.  However, we know it is a serious problem.  According to Sustainable Energy Ireland, 227,000 households experience some degree of fuel poverty.  The impact of fuel poverty ranges from uncomfortable living conditions to more serious negative effects such as poor physical or mental health, increased debt and a decline in the physical condition of houses.  In 2006, the Central Statistics Office reported that almost 6% of the population had to go without heating at some stage in 2005 due to lack of money.  Research has shown that people, particularly older people, are dying because they are unable to heat their homes sufficiently.A strong correlation has been identified between fuel poverty, the standard of housing and the 2,000 excess winter deaths which occur in Ireland each year.  It has been calculated that Ireland has the second highest rate of excess winter deaths among a sample of countries in Europe.  Poorer people spend more on energy because they live in energy inefficient homes.  As they spend so much on energy, scarce resources are not available for other necessities such as food, clothing and transport.  Lone parents and older people are much more likely to suffer energy poverty than any other group.  In 2004-05, those in the lowest income bracket spent an average of 13% of their disposable income on energy, while the highest earners spent just 1.7% of their incomes on energy.  Last winter, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul gave €3.4 million in supports to people struggling in their homes.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I wish to share time with Deputy Shortall.The frightening aspect of this decision by the Minister for Health and Children highlighted in all the letters and e-mails I have received is the mention of the words "save lives".  Every newspaper has mentioned "save lives" and has printed headlines such as "A Small Price to Pay to Save Lives", "A Drop in the Ocean to Save Lives", "Budget Cuts that Put Girls' Lives in Danger", "Death Sentence on 12 year olds" and so on.This is the first time during my membership of the House that actions by the Government of the day knowingly put lives at risk.  The equation that €10 million in savings equals ten, 20 or, as suggested in many newspapers, 90 deaths is an unbelievable statistic for a Minister to have attributed to her actions if reports by experts are correct.  The so-called saving of 0.7% of the Department's budget of €14 billion cannot be measured as such if lives are at stake.  This should never be allowed to happen when there is clear and undeniable evidence, which, amazingly, has not been contradicted by the Minister, her Department or the HSE, that lives can be saved if the scheme is rolled out.Cancer is a terrible illness, which never goes away.  Constant scans, tests, etc., are required for those who are diagnosed and treated.  The worry and concern for patients and their families as they wait for results are palpable.  I recall on one occasion a nurse informing my wife, a cancer sufferer, that she would receive good news because she saw the state of worry my wife was in even before she saw the consultant.  However, the Government has within its remit the powers to prevent such occurrences but is allowing the equation, savings equals loss of lives, to be the accepted formula.  In an article in the Irish Daily Mail on Friday, 7 November, a woman who suffered from cervical cancer stated, “Life is not a rehearsal. We should grab every opportunity we have”.  This is relevant to the debate.  There are no replays in life and any dangers to it must be addressed when possible.  This is one such occasion.The Minister has reached great heights, achieved a great deal and will be remembered fondly in history but her record will be blemished if the equation, savings equals loss of lives, is part of her legacy.  Many figures are bandied about regarding the costs incurred by the HSE on bonuses, special advisers and the PPARS system, each of which, individually or on a combined basis, could provide the savings necessary to roll out this vaccination programme.  The issues highlighted in the newspapers and e-mails could be resolved but, most important, lives could be saved.  Nothing is as precious as life and if the Government seeks to face down the Opposition for the sake of procedure later, I am afraid it will be a sad day for the House.Last August, the Irish Cancer Society welcomed unreservedly the decision to roll-out the mass vaccination programme for all girls aged 12 years.  All the evidence relating to such programmes suggest they are a safe and effective way of preventing HPV.  Dr. Gráinne Flannelly of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and chairman of the Irish Medical Organisation medical committee stated, "It is time for Ireland to take the lead in preventing cervical cancer. We cannot delay any longer".   The Taoiseach stated earlier a Deputy was using emotional blackmail in this important matter.  I assure him that a family in which a loved one is a cancer sufferer would not wish it to be inflicted on anyone else.  Is it emotional?  Sir, one can bet one's life on it.  Is it blackmail to seek to prevent the disease in other instances?  No, a thousand times, no, if it means the Minister will restore the programme through savings in other sectors or in whatever way.  The threat of cancer to the 100 girls who may die following treatment for cervical cancer is not acceptable.  I ask the Minister to change her mind in this regard.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	689	Like my Labour Party colleagues, I fully support this important Fine Gael motion, which will be a test of every Government Member.  From a political perspective, the decision is curious.  I am glad the Minister is present and I hope she will respond to a few questions regarding various issues surrounding this matter.Cancer scares all of us.  It poses a huge challenge for the health services and the most frightening aspect of the disease is its random nature.  While families have predispositions to cancer and so on because of lifestyle, a significant element of randomness is involved in cancer striking.  Few types of cancer can be prevented.  Advice can be provided regarding lifestyle such as not smoking and being careful about drinking and food consumption, which can reduce a person's chances of contracting the disease, but no vaccine is available to substantially reduce one's chances of developing most forms of cancer except cervical cancer.  That is why the vaccine represents a significant breakthrough in health care and preventative medicine, which is severely under-developed in this State.For that reason, HIQA recommended earlier this year that the HPV be introduced for 12 year olds.  When the Minister considered all aspects of the programme and decided to go with it, everybody warmly welcomed the decision because it was looked on as a good step in developing preventative measures for cervical cancer and it was clearly established that investment by Government in such a vaccination programme would yield dividends in terms of lives saved.  That is why from a human, economic and health perspective it was a no brainer.  It made absolute sense to introduce this new vaccine.  The number of lives that would be saved by its introduction could be identified.  In September the Minister decided to go along with it and announced the programme, which was welcomed by everybody.The Minister's announcement of the U-turn last week came as a bolt from the blue.  I cannot understand why this is the case.  She is an intelligent, thoughtful and considerate person and it does not make sense that if a vaccine is available to save lives and she announced that she intended to introduce it, that she would do a U-turn on it for the sake of less than €10 million.  We have often dealt with issues in the past where there was an emergency and money had to be found.  Irrespective of the difficulties within the economy, it could always be found, especially when a small amount was involved.  There would be no difficulty in finding less than €10 million, either from the health budget or across various Departments, and it does not make sense for the Minister to say to us that the money could not be found.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister's Cabinet colleagues are hanging her out to dry if they are refusing to provide that €10 million.  This does not make sense on any front, other than that it is a political manoeuvre on the part of her Cabinet colleagues.There are umpteen ways in which the money can be found.  Today, my party leader, Deputy Gilmore, made the point that there is agreement across the House on the part of every Member that this vaccine programme should be introduced.  There is agreement that the sum involved, less than €10 million, is minute in the context of the budget generally.  There is agreement that if people sat down and put their heads together they could find that €10 million today, if there was a political will to do so.  The offer was made that the other health spokespersons would work with the Minister to identify where the money could be raised.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept that offer.  It is up to her backbenchers tonight to apply maximum pressure and to ensure that she makes the U-turn that everybody so badly wants her to do.

Professor Tom Keane took up his post as national cancer control director on 19 November 2007.Our first priority, therefore, during the past 18 months has been to invest in putting in place eight designated centres with a multidisciplinary team of experts to be able to care for patients who are diagnosed with cancer.  The second priority is screening programmes.  Many other European countries and countries beyond Europe have been involved in screening programmes for some considerable time.As a person living in the mid-west, we were one of the first groups to benefit under the pilot scheme for the cervical screening programme.  That was a great success where the vast majority of women turned up at the general practitioners' clinics and where the nurses carried out the cervical screening programme.  We in the mid-west led it in some ways and we see that it has been a great success.  We are delighted to see the roll-out of a national cervical screening programme, which began in September of this year.Cervical screening has the capacity to prevent 80% to 90% of cervical cancers.  Some 70 to 100 women present with cervical cancer each year.  A national screening programme for women aged between 25 and 60 has the capacity to eliminate the incidence of cervical cancer by 80% to 90%.  The cervical screening programme will cost €35 million in a full year.  An extra €25 million will be allocated to that programme next year and an extra €15 million will be allocated to the cancer control programme to allow Professor Keane continue to recruit the expertise we require in the eight centres to provide, in particular, multidisciplinary care.  That €50 million funding has been identified for those two programmes.  Surely this is evidence, if evidence were needed, of the Government's commitment to tackling cancer in all its forms, and cervical cancer in particular.Despite the extremely difficult economic circumstances facing us, the Government has been able to make a total additional allocation of €15 million to the National Cancer Control Programme in 2009 for service developments.  With this funding the National Cancer Control Programme will concentrate on developing high quality services to combat lung and prostate cancers which together account for over 2,000 deaths each year.On cervical cancer specifically, our immediate responsibility is to women who have already been exposed to HPV and who may already have pre-cancerous changes or undetected cervical cancer.  Vaccination is a long-term investment which will only be offset by improved health outcomes and treatment savings in 15 to 30 years in the future.Each year between 250 and 300 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, with an average age at time of diagnosis of 44.  The impression now being created by some people is that there is no preventative programme against cervical cancer in Ireland, which is entirely untrue.  The clear international evidence is that the first step is to organise an effective screening programme, and to then follow it with HPV vaccination.  This is exactly what we are doing.Population based cervical cancer screening carries both immediate and long-term benefits.  It carries the significant advantage of delivering earlier benefits than a vaccination programme.  The requirement for a screening programme will not be eliminated by a vaccination programme, although in the long term, it is hoped that a vaccination programme would reduce the reliance on screening.  The highest priority must be attached to implementing and sustaining the national cervical screening programme.The national programme provides screening in a primary care setting every three years for women aged 25-44 and screening every five years for women aged 45-60.  It will deliver a national quality assured, organised cervical screening programme and it will be implemented in line with best international practice.  All elements of the programme will be quality assured — call and recall, laboratory services, and colposcopy will be managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  Results will be available to women within four weeks of their smear test and all smear test slides will be read twice by two separate cytotechnologists.Difficult times require that we make difficult decisions.  These decisions need to be evidence based and scientifically sound.  I am satisfied that we have got our priority right here in terms of our decision to invest, in the first instance, in rolling out the national screening programme.

The focus of our discourse here this evening must be on prevention because that is what the free screening programme for cervical cancer is intended to achieve.The screening programme, which has been available throughout the country since September, aims to pick women up before they develop cervical cancer.  Smear tests have the ability to identify pre-cancerous cells.  I commend the Minister for rolling out the programme nationally.  As the House will be aware, it was available only in the mid-west of the country as a pilot programme.The Government has allocated an extra €25 million for the CervicalCheck screening programme.  The full-year cost is €35 million.  It is projected that, in total, approximately 100,000 women will have been screened by the end of the year.  If a woman has already developed cervical cancer at the time of her smear test, this can also be detected.  It is estimated that the screening programme can reduce deaths from cervical cancer by between 80% and 90%.In September 2007, the Government endorsed the establishment by the Health Service Executive of a National Cancer Control Programme to manage, organise and deliver a national programme for the entire population in line with the Government's National Cancer Control Strategy.Over the past 18 months, the HSE, supported by the Government, first prioritised investment in putting in place eight designated centres with a multidisciplinary team of experts to care for patients who are diagnosed with cancer.  This approach adheres strictly to international best practice in the treatment of cancer, which is an indiscriminate disease that has touched so many families across our nation.The second priority is the development of screening programmes.  The breast screening programme will be completed during next year for those five counties to which it has not yet been rolled out.  The cervical screening programme, which began in September for women aged between 25 and 60, has the capacity to eliminate the incidence of cervical cancer by 80% to 90%.  Some 70 to 100 women present with cervical cancer each year.  The HPV virus vaccine is just one part of helping to prevent deaths from such cancer.  We must bear in mind that the requirement for a population-based cervical cancer screening programme is not replaced by the introduction of a vaccination programme.  At least 30% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV types not covered by the vaccine.The Opposition has tried to suggest that girls who do not get the vaccine are placed in such a vulnerable position that some of them will die.  This argument is wrong.  It is intended as emotional blackmail.  The fact is that girls who are now aged 12 and do not get the vaccine will still be able to take full advantage of the extremely effective screening process at the appropriate age.Given the nature of the development of cervical cancer, screening programmes generally do not start until women are in their 20s.  Our programme is now offered to women between the ages of 25 and 60.  The virus that leads to cervical cancer is transmitted by sexual activity.  It is very rare that someone who has not been sexually active would contract such cancer from this virus.For all these reasons, it is wrong for the Opposition to claim that without a vaccination programme starting next year more than 50 girls who are now aged 12 will die from such cancer.  This implies that no screening programme or treatment services would be in place.

This is the medical reality, although the Opposition would like to distort it in its own political self-interest.We are living through extremely challenging economic times and the Government has had to make difficult budgetary choices.  Despite this, the Government has been able to make a total additional allocation of €15 million to the national cancer control programme in 2009.  With this funding, the National Cancer Control Programme will focus on developing high-quality services to combat lung and prostate cancers which together account for more than 2,000 deaths annually.Early presentation and speedy access are critical to improve outcomes for patients.  This is the reason the cancer control programme is so crucial.  It will establish rapid access diagnostic clinics for lung and prostate cancer.  Patients with symptoms will be referred to the nearest designated cancer centre for diagnosis so their treatment will be fast and effective.

Despite what has been stated across the floor I believe the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, has a great interest in this subject.  I have known her for a long time and I have worked with her in my constituency and in the Dáil.  Since becoming a Deputy I have had first-hand knowledge of the care she has shown with regard to this issue.  She has worked closely on it with the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am pleased to have been a member for the past six years.I want to paraphrase Deputy Róisín Shortall who explained how cancer frightens her.  Cancer also frightens me and as a small child it was the first disease of which I heard.  While it has not affected me, thank God, I have carried the fear through my life.  I have lost family members and young people I knew to it.  In recent weeks, the Tallaght community was greatly upset by the passing of Margaret Farrell, a well-known former Fianna Fáil councillor.  Every one of us will be affected by cancer at one time or another and we all care about this issue.Today, I received several hundred communications at my constituency office, as I am sure did other colleagues.  We have hardly done anything else except deal with them.  I am always glad when people in my constituency contact me about issues.  The Minister knows this is an issue in Dublin South-West as well as everywhere else.I do not want to concentrate on my own constituency but on many occasions in this House I have spoken about Tallaght Hospital and the programmes there.  The cancer report of 2007 issued by the Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Dublin highlighted in a special way the needs of my wider community as far as cancer services are concerned.  To show it is not only about Tallaght, Tallaght Hospital's catchment area stretches through that part of Dublin and out to Kildare and Wicklow to the border at Carnew.I take a great deal of interest in this issue and the Minister should know we are concerned about it.  I am also concerned about the general delivery of cancer services in the Tallaght region.  The Minister will know this debate is generating a great deal of attention.  Many people are contacting us and I wanted to convey this to her.  I wish her well as she deals with the issue.
#JamesMcDaid	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-party	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-dob	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	706	While I am fully aware of these difficult economic times for our country, and how impossible it is to explain to our people that we can no longer afford services which we previously took for granted, the withdrawal of a life-saving vaccine is not a measure I can support.  We have only to examine the history of vaccinations and see how successful they have been.  We have practically eradicated smallpox, polio, diphtheria, tetanus and, to a large extent, tuberculosis.  In the future, the world will rejoice the day a vaccine for AIDS is produced.In our time, we have found a vaccine against a cancer which afflicts 200 of our women every year and which is responsible for the deaths of 70 to 80 of these women on an annual basis.  The vaccine has the unanimous support of the world's foremost institutions, including the world centre for disease control.  The renowned New England Journal of Medicine advocated it should be given to all female children between the ages of ten and 12, and possibly to those aged up to and including 15 years, depending on the morals and policies of individual nations.  The journal also stated it is the greatest scientific advance that any Government can do for its people today.  It would protect 70% of the girls from developing cancer and with the welcome introduction of the screening introduced by the Minister, in our generation we could go a long way to reducing the numbers to insignificance in the future.However, on purely economic grounds — the New England Journal of Medicine contradicts the Minister on this point — the Minister has decided to drop its introduction for the foreseeable future.  The sunset period on its effectiveness is why I state that in so doing we will pass a death sentence on a certain percentage of the 12 year old girls whose parents cannot afford the cost of it.  Is there anyone in this House who would not give the vaccine to their daughters today?I have been a friend of the Minister for 20 years and five different Fianna Fáil Taoisigh have recognised her commitment, capabilities and contribution to Irish society over a long period in political life.  Yes, these are extraordinary times but I cannot see the logic of her decision, not even on economic terms.  We have a responsibility to look after the health of our people and I have admired the Minister on many occasions in this regard.  We have a responsibility in particular to look after the future health of our children.Fifty years from now, it will not be important what my bank account was, what type or car I drove or what size of house I lived in.  It does matter to me that during my stay in this House I may have been, just may have been, important in the life of a child.  Accordingly, I cannot vote for the Government's motion this evening.  I fully realise the implications of this but I trust that my colleagues understand that while I will abstain I will not vote per se against them.  I cannot vote against an oath I took 34 years ago.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, which has been allowed, by some contributors, to become highly charged and emotive.  Some Members have taken a populist approach to this issue, but that is certainly not so in the case of my colleague and friend, Deputy McDaid, who comes to this debate as a person with medical training and knowledge.  It is something I and others do not have.  Those who have taken a populist approach in this debate have referred to "children" and "imminent death" in the same breath in an effort to conjure up misplaced concerns among the parents of young children.  There is no basis for the claim that young children will suffer as a result of the Minister's decision to postpone the introduction of the cervical cancer vaccination programme until some time in the future.The facts circulated by some individuals are misleading.  An e-mail campaign under way today highlights the orchestrated nature of the effort to mislead in an underhand and callous way.  Nowhere in the instructions or directions in the chain mail is any effort made to explain the complex nature and causative factors of cervical cancer.  Nor is any effort made to explain the limitations of the HPV vaccine or to identify the immediacy of the requirement to detect pre-cancerous conditions through the national cervical screening programme.As I understand it, the two vaccines licensed for use in this State have a capacity, at best, to vaccinate against 70% of cases of cervical cancer.  Therefore, there will remain 30% of women whose cancer will not be prevented by the introduction of a vaccination programme.  I understand the long-term benefits of the vaccine have not been established in medical trials longer than five years.  This is not to take from the importance of putting the vaccination programme in place.  However, it is more important, prior to implementing that programme, to put in place an effective screening programme that caters for the entire population.  As the resources become available, a vaccination programme should be introduced in the future, in line with other vaccination programmes.  However, it is important to recognise that those vaccinated will still be required to undergo screening, as the vaccine does not guarantee protection against all forms of HPV.In the delivery of identification and preventative medicine in regard to cancer in general and cervical cancer in particular, priority must be given to women who already have cervical cancer or pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix.  To this end, a well resourced national screening programme based on the cervical smear test is the best solution.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, remarked, it has already been rolled out as a pilot programme in the mid-west region, where it has been very effective.  Lest anybody think that women in the mid-west have been treated more favourably than others, we are still awaiting the full roll-out of the breast screening programme.  That too will be welcome when it is introduced in the mid-west.  Resources have clearly played a role in regard to the roll-out of breast cancer screening services.  This has always been the case in terms of the roll-out of preventative medicine.  The cervical cancer vaccination programme can be no different, particularly in the stringent times in which we are operating.The McCoogan report of 2004 alludes to research in Britain which shows the benefits of a national screening programme.  It is estimated that the introduction of such a programme in this State will reduce current mortality rates by 80%.  This is a good benchmark towards which we should aim.  We must get the screening programme right before focusing on the vaccine.  Screening is not a test for cancer but rather a method of preventing it by detecting and treating early abnormalities.  It is a method we must embrace.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Like every other Member, including the Minister, I would be delighted to see the introduction of the cervical cancer vaccination programme at this point in time.  However, as a former Minister for Health and Children, and in fairness to the Minister, Deputy Harney, who has done excellent work in her Department, we must recognise that there are choices to be made.  No Government in the world has the funding to do everything it would like to do in the area of health provision.  I recognise the work that has been done, including the appointment of Professor Tom Keane, a dedicated man of ability, as director of the national cancer strategy, and the additional funding the Minister has provided for 2009.In a choice between a vaccination programme and the national cervical screening programme, I would have absolutely no doubt that the latter is by far the more important for women aged 25 to 60 years.  The screening programme will reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by 80% in the population as a whole and by up to 95% for an individual.  These are the types of figures we aim to achieve.  The vaccine is effective against four human papillomaviruses, of which there are almost 100 that can cause cancer.  It has an effectiveness rate of 70%.  During my time as Minister for Health and Children, we decided not to introduce testing for hepatitis C because it had only a 70% success rate.The girls who would receive the vaccine at 12 years of age will still require pap smears because the vaccine on its own will not be sufficient to ensure they do not develop cancer.  It is important to note that the 12 year olds who receive the vaccine will not be denied pap smears in the future.  The cervical screening programme will be quality assured.  The vaccines are relatively new, one of them being licensed in 2006 and the other in 2007, and there is uncertainty as to whether they are effective for longer than five years.  Side effects have been reported which require further investigation.  The vaccine has not been introduced in at least seven European countries.  My colleague, Deputy McDaid, referred to the New England Journal of Medicine.  An article that appeared in this reputable journal on 21 August 2008 set out several reasons to be cautious in regard to human papillomavirus vaccination.We must all work hard in this House towards the objective of preventing, diagnosing, treating and eliminating all diseases.  However, all Members know it is not possible to have the funding to do everything we would like to do.  I am pleased the Minister is pushing ahead with the cervical cancer screening programme, although, like every other Member, I would have liked it to be possible also to introduce the vaccination programme.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The best possible protection for women is for us to ensure we fully implement CervicalCheck, the free screening programme for cervical cancer which is available since September 2008.  In addition, we must continue to invest in the development of top quality cancer care treatment at the eight designated centres.  As the Minister said in the House last night, we do not have a good record of cancer care outcomes except in child cancer.  The reason for this is that child cancer care is centrally located in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  The Government's main consideration, therefore, has been to invest in the implementation of multidisciplinary teams to care for cancer patients.  Fragmented cancer care does not serve the public well and we are all agreed that we want better outcomes for cancer patients.CervicalCheck will cost some €35 million this year and an additional €25 million next year.  The impression being peddled by the media and between the lines of the speeches by Opposition Members is that there is no preventative programme against cervical cancer.  That is wholly untrue.  International experience has shown that a screening programme is the most important step in prevention, before proceeding to the introduction of a vaccination programme.  Genital HPV infections are passed primarily through sexual activity.  Accordingly, the risk factors include early sexual activity and the existence of numerous sexual partners.  Smoking has also been shown to be a contributory factor.  The Government can and will do a certain amount but there is also an onus on the individual to minimise the possibility of developing HPV infections because all cervical cancers develop as a result of such infection.  The cervical check will provide free smear tests to the 1.1 million women living in Ireland aged between 25 and 60 years.  That is welcome, as it is rare for women under the age of 25 to get this form of cancer.  The objective is to identify the women before they develop the cancer, and the smear test has the ability to identify pre-cancerous cells.It is far easier not to make a decision.  While the Opposition and the talk show hosts, who think they are governing the country, deplore the Minister and accuse her of many things, such as allowing 50 girls to die, being devoid of emotion and lacking in compassion——

It is simply incorrect to make those accusations and it is irresponsible to put the terms "young children" and "imminent death" in the same sentence.  It implies no screening programme is in place.  Our top priority is to put in place a programme that gives protection to women now.  By the end of this year, 100,000 women will be screened and the lives of many of those women will be saved.  That is a fact.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I wish to share time with Deputies Ring, Clune, McEntee, Varadkar, Crawford and Kehoe.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  On 5 August last, the Minister for Health and Children said:I accept the expert advice that the introduction of a universal, high uptake vaccination programme for young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer rates.  I intend to seek Government approval for the programme and for the required funding in the autumn, based on the implementation of a plan that can be shown to be cost effective in terms of delivery costs and uptake rates.Today the Government and the Minister claim that to agree with the foregoing and disagree with the removal of the Minister's proposal is emotional blackmail.  We are agreeing with what the HIQA said to the Minister and what she believed, and probably still believes, that this is a vital issue in dealing with cervical cancer.  Now we are accused of emotional blackmail.I agree with Deputy McDaid — to withdraw the vaccination is a death sentence.  That is what Deputy McDaid, an eminent physician, said about this.  It is unconscionable that the Minister would withdraw a life saving programme for minimal savings.  Cervical cancer is one of the few cancers whose cause is known.  We know how to prevent it and a vaccination is available that will protect our children from it.  There are approximately 240 new cases of cervical cancer every year, with approximately 100 women dying of the disease annually.  The HPV vaccination is a life saving vaccine that could cause a 65% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer and a 56% reduction in the number of deaths from the disease.The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report published three months ago advised the Minister that it would cost €9.7 million to administer the plan to vaccinate 12 year old girls.  The cost of the electronic voting machines would cover this programme for six years.  The vaccine can save our mothers, sisters and daughters from a cancer that needlessly claims many lives each year.  It is simply unbelievable that the Minister cannot find the €10 million from a budget of €16 billion.The Minister claims the withdrawal of the vaccine is the result of a choice between it and cervical cancer screening and other important cancer services.  That is not the case.  It is a choice between the vaccine and bonuses for the bosses, the bulging bureaucracy and cash for consultancy services.  The Government found €7.96 million to spend on consultancy services for PPARS, €10 million on special advisers, press officers and constituency staff, €1.4 million for bonuses and €1 million on consultants to transform the HSE, but it cannot find €10 million to introduce this life saving vaccine.The introduction of the vaccine is also a cost saving measure in that it will reduce the burden on hospital services in the long term.  The Government has rowed back on its commitment.  The recent development of a cervical cancer vaccine opens the possibility of effectively ending cervical cancer within a few generations.  We believe it should be available as a universal public health entitlement, as recommended by experts.  I urge the Minister to reconsider her decision to cancel this programme.

It should be run out of office.The Taoiseach this morning pointed to Fine Gael and asked us to find the money.  I put down a parliamentary question yesterday about the artists' tax exemption scheme.  It was set up in 1994-5.  When it was set up, it cost €6.5 million.  According to the figures I received yesterday, in 2003 it amounted to €22 million not paid in tax and in 2005 it was a total of €34,800,000.  That is almost a 50% increase in two years and the last figure relates to 2005, not 2006 and 2007.  All I ask the Minister to do is take 25% of the 2005 figure.  It is a simple thing to do.  I have found the money for the Minister, so I ask her to reverse the decision immediately.  The Minister and the Government need not tell us they cannot find the money.The money is there.  The Taoiseach has asked for patriotism in this country.  I am saying to the artists, the patriots, that we are not taking the entire scheme away.  All we seek is 25% of it, which will pay for the vaccine that will keep women alive.  It will cost €9.7 million, and I have found the money for the Minister.  I ask her to do the right thing tonight.  I call on the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the women of Fianna Fáil to vote with us tonight and ensure that this necessary scheme is retained and that young girls will get the vaccination they need.  In years to come these girls will not die from cervical cancer.  It is a simple thing to do.I have no wish to hold up the debate.  I have made my suggestion and have found the money for the Minister.  She should do the decent thing now and accept this motion.  The money can and should be found for this.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I hope the Minister will have a change of heart about this motion and not force the Deputies on the Government side to vote against it.  I have listened to speakers on the Government side almost justifying not introducing this vaccination programme.  They say it will only affect 70%.  We have heard the New England Journal of Medicine quoted, contradicted and riders attached to the quotes.  The fact is that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was asked to produce a report on the introduction of the vaccination programme.  It recommended in positive terms that the programme be introduced for 12 year old girls and that there be a catch-up programme for girls aged 13 to 15 years old.The Minister agreed with the HIQA report.  It was clear and positive.  It outlined the figures for the effect the programme would have in reducing the number of cervical cancer cases and the number of deaths from such cases.  More than three months ago the Minister positively endorsed the report and announced the introduction of a vaccination programme for 12 year old girls.  However, within a short time that decision has been reversed on economic grounds.  Having listened to the contributions in the House and in the media on the debate which justify the decision one would think we were discussing a by-pass or other road infrastructure project, whereas we are discussing people's lives.  I do not wish to be emotive but practical and I appeal to the Minister to reverse the decision on economic grounds.  There is evidence this programme could save the lives of young girls and women in later years.  The programme would also save the State money in the long term and withdrawing it is a false economy.The bottom line is that parents who can afford to provide the vaccine for their daughters will do so, especially following the publicity generated in the past week.  People are well educated and are aware of the value of this vaccination programme.  Any parent who can afford to pay for vaccination will not ignore the evidence or the figures and will ensure their daughter is vaccinated.  However, this only applies to parents who have the means to do so.  It is fine for those who have a choice, but there are adverse consequences for those who do not have a choice and cannot afford it.  The programme is estimated to cost €600 for the three courses comprising the vaccination.  Those who cannot afford the treatment for their daughters are being discriminated against by this unjust and unfair reversal of a decision about which the Minister was so enthusiastic only three months ago.  Yet, today we hear it cannot proceed for economic reasons.Will the Minister reconsider this unjust decision which prevents universal vaccination?  Such a move would prevent those sitting on the Government side of the House from going through the torture of having to support a motion that, in their hearts, they cannot support.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this decision.The Minister stated only two EU countries, namely, Finland and Ireland, do not have this vaccination programme in place.  However, I heard on the radio this evening that Finland has a gold card and a cancer prevention programme and that the mortality rates are considerably lower there than in Ireland.  Therefore, it does not make sense to compare the two countries.  It is clear the cost of the programme is a small amount of money in the overall scheme of things.  There have been numerous suggestions put to the Minister on how she could find savings elsewhere in the €16 billion health budget.  I appeal to her to reconsider the decision and to re-examine the health allocation to find the necessary means to introduce this programme.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I am pleased to take the opportunity to discuss this subject.  I never considered that when the Minister, Deputy Harney, announced the introduction of the programme last August we would spend a Wednesday evening discussing the way it has been dismantled so quickly.  If the Minister is determined to stay in power, she must take back control of the health service.  It is a system run with no heart and no business sense.  Those in the health service know everything about protecting their own interests, which is usually a job at all costs and this includes the Minister, Deputy Harney.Since the budget every aspect of expenditure, including health, agriculture or education has been treated in the same fashion.  No elected representative who supports the Government, whether from Fianna Fáil, the former Progressive Democrats, the Green Party or Independent, has met with the public to explain its actions and how it came up with certain aspects of the budget.It is acceptable for anyone to play the political card, especially if one operates in the world of politics, but we are discussing people's lives, and more importantly, saving people's lives.  The Government is putting 100 people, at a cost of €100, 000 each, at unnecessary risk of developing cervical cancer each year.  This equation puts the life of every woman who will develop this cancer at €100,000.  Is this the cost the Government puts on a woman's life?I refer to another financial point.  How much does it cost the State to treat a patient who may or may not live after they have been diagnosed with this cancer?  A sum of €100,000 would not see such people through the first six months of treatment when one considers the cost of hospital accommodation, possible surgery, medication and other therapies.  This is why the decision is so uneconomic and inhuman.  The facts are in the HIQA report.  There is no justifiable argument for cancelling the wonderful opportunity which the Minister announced last August.The Minister should get rid of her advisers and spin doctors.  Let us show some humanity in the manner in which we run the country and especially the health service.  I cannot understand how we reached this point.  When the Minister announced the programme last August it was seen as a move forward.  I have been a Member of the House for three years and I was previously involved in such businesses as farming, pubs, restaurants and sales.  I learned that one must always approach finances using common sense.  In my three years in the House I learned everything is related to money.  There was money available and now it is gone.  However, in this case one must mix financial needs with those of the heart.  I do not know who advised the Minister and I realise she is not listening——

I will not speak for women as it is not my job and there are enough women in the House who realise the implications of the decision for them.  However, I can speak for fathers and grandfathers.  This is the most disgraceful and inhuman decision that any country or any Government could make for their children.  There are no children here tonight but if the matter concerned any other lobby group such people would be here.  However, this concerns 12 year old children who are at home trying to prepare for Christmas exams.  E-mails on the matter have been sent by some children.  There is nothing wrong with this and I received 23 e-mails in the space of a couple of minutes.The Government should not proceed with this decision.  It puts the cost of the lives of our girls, and in my case my granddaughters, at €100,000 each.  These are the hard facts.  The Minister should get rid of whoever devised the budget as those people are a bunch of gombeens.  The Minister could not have made this decision as no human being could devise such a budget and put the health of our children at risk, as well as putting education programmes and our agricultural sector in jeopardy.  I call on anyone who is a father or grandfather in the House, and the Minister can do likewise for any women, to vote against the Government amendment.  One can only be proud of Deputy James McDaid.  He remained loyal to his party, but he knows what is right for the country.  The Minister should withdraw the Government amendment.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I have only a few points to make and I do not propose to repeat or labour the arguments already made.  Previously, I worked for a time in the gynaecologic oncology services in St. James's Hospital and I know something of cervical cancer.  I have treated patients who subsequently died from the disease.  I have seen the extent to which it is a horribly mutilating disease.  I have also seen young women lose fertility and the opportunity to have a family following the removal of the womb to which the cancer had spread.  Aside from those who get cervical cancer, there are women who must face repeat smears, attend for colposcopies and letts procedures, and who must go through all the stress and anxiety involved in these procedures.  I think of them tonight in this debate.The gardasil and cervarix human papilloma virus vaccines were mentioned in the debate last night.  This is another example of unnecessary inequity.  Those who can afford it may visit their general practitioner and pay a fee of €100 or €150 and then pay a further €300 for the vaccine.  I do not know if those figures are exact, but they are roughly correct.  However, this is not the case for people from poorer backgrounds.  The vaccine is not available under the general medical services scheme in the same way that the contraceptive pill, viagra, augmetin and so on are available.  Will the Minister make the vaccine available under the general medical services scheme, at least for this year, for parents who wish to see their daughters vaccinated?  This would go some way to resolving the issue.Although I do not receive any remuneration for it, I work in general practice and I encounter young women at high risk.  These women start sexual activity at a young age, perhaps at 15 or 16 years.  They do not use protection and all I can offer them, because they generally come from poor backgrounds, is the contraceptive pill or the depot, so they do not get pregnant.  I cannot offer them a vaccine to protect them from getting the human papilloma virus or cervical cancer later on because I know they cannot afford it.  I do not think that is right, and if she can do anything tonight, she should at least give a commitment that the vaccine will be available on the GMS until it becomes part of the screening programme.Another issue not mentioned tonight is the impact on boys.  HPV is not just responsible for cervical cancer, cancer of the vulva and so on.  It is also responsible for genital warts and is implicated in anal cancer and cancer of the penis.  We should not forget that boys are also affected by this and any inaction on HPV puts them at greater risk.  The vaccine is licensed for boys in the UK, although it is not part of the national screening programme for them.  For some reason, boys are always forgotten during health debates.For the doctors in the House, Deputy McDaid has been given some credit for abstaining on this issue.  He will probably get a bit of publicity and will come out the winner for it, but women and everyone else will be the losers.  If he was more sincere about it he would cross the floor, but there are other doctors on that side of the House.  Deputy O'Hanlon and the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, have a strong understanding of this issue and it is very disappointing that they have not decided to vote against the Government on this occasion, or even to abstain.I am an admirer of the Minister, Deputy Harney.  She has been an excellent Minister.  She has shown courage, leadership and much honesty in her political career.  I do not want to make a personalised attack on her.  She has not reformed the health service, but unlike many of her predecessors, she has tried.  However, on this occasion she has not tried.  She could try a little bit harder and find the €10 million needed for this vaccine, or at least make it available on the GMS for the interim period.  I commend the motion to the House.

I thought that the Minister would have seen the light over the weekend, but instead she said that the Opposition is playing politics with this very important motion.  We are not playing politics.  We see children aged 12 having a chance of living longer, but the Government sees girls aged 12 dying with cervical cancer in the future.  As politicians, we all go to funerals and one type of funeral we hate attending is that of a young woman who has died from cancer.  We hate going into a mortuary and seeing a young woman dead because of cancer.  The Government has a chance to do something tonight, but its Deputies are sticking to the party line and forgetting about people outside of this House.Death from cancer is slow and painful.  It is a long, painful road that nobody wants to travel.  The Minister states that she is saving €10 million on the vaccination programme and €6 million on its implementation, but that is not a lot of money.  If she asked every woman to go out with a bucket and collect money next Saturday, then we could bring in millions of euro between now and Christmas.I looked up the website of the Progressive Democrats Party this evening.  That party is now dead and gone, and it had a long, slow and painful death.  I was horrified to read a statement posted on 5 August:The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney T.D., announced (Tuesday 5th August, 2008) that she has asked the HSE to prepare and submit a plan for the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme for 12 year old girls to commence in September 2009.How does the Minister feel about this right now?  The Progressive Democrats Party is defunct, gone and dead.  The same will happen to many 12 year old girls if she does not change her mind between now and 8.30 p.m.I admired Deputy McDaid when he spoke earlier.  However, he then said that he was abstaining.  He might as well vote with the Government, because if he had something in his heart, he would go up the stairs and turn right with the Opposition.  Talk is very cheap.  Government Deputies will leave this House tonight and I hope they feel proud of what they are about to do.  They should think about what they are voting for — the death of young children.  When they are on the streets, or when they go to the shopping centre, they should look at 12 year old girls and think where they will be in the years to come.  They will be dead because of this Government.

I have nieces in their teens and friends who have teenage daughters.  It is absolutely shameful of the Government to claim it is introducing something in August, but to take it back two or three months later.  The Minister said in August that this would save lives.  Is it okay to save lives in August and let them die in November?  That is what she is saying, as is every Deputy from the Government side of the House.  If Deputy Mary White was on this side of the House, she would be jumping up and down.  Not one person from the Green Party had the audacity to come into this House and listen to the debate.  I have not seen one of them tonight, and I did not see one of them last night.  They have not got what it takes.  They want to stay in power, but if they had what it takes to be in power, they would do the honourable thing tonight and go up the stairs and turn right.

I have known the Minister for a long time.  I know what happened in Monaghan.  I know what we were told and what happened afterwards.  However, this is about 12 year old girls.  This scheme was announced in August, at a time when everybody knew the economic situation in which the country found itself, and it was later withdrawn, which is unbelievable.  It just shows the problem with planning and structures in the HSE and in the Department of Health and Children.  The problem is that there is no planning.Monaghan General Hospital is being closed down, yet I received a phone call from the father of a 16 year old who has been on a trolley in Cavan for three days.  Even his pillows were stolen last night.  This is the situation in which we find ourselves.  I beg the Minister and the Government to do the right thing.  They can find a lot of money for consultants, so they should find the money for 12 year old girls.

We know that countries that have organised cervical cancer screening programmes have substantially reduced both the number of new cases and deaths from cervical cancer.  The Government's investment of €35 million in this programme demonstrates our commitment to a national screening programme.  Far from the Opposition having a monopoly on empathy for children and young women, as they would purport to do in some of their contributions, that is not the case.  We are facing very difficult times and will be facing tough economic times next year.

We have made huge progress on all these issues.  The one major indicator of improvements in our health service is that the average lifespan is over 80, way ahead of the European average.  We have made major progress on this over the years, which is down in large part to the reforming zeal of the Minister, Deputy Harney.  Only today, I read in the newspaper that treatments for day-care patients are up by 40%.  We are getting people through our hospitals much quicker.  We are making beds available in that way through reform and that was recorded today.  Has there been a word about this in the House, or do we have to listen to this hysteria about us not caring about the deaths of young children?

It is important to bear in mind also that at least 30% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV types not covered by the vaccine, as many contributors have already pointed out.In the context of the cancer programme upon which the Government has embarked, there are a number of priorities from a clinical point of view.  Clearly, the first priority is to ensure that we organise our cancer services to deliver better outcomes for patients.  This includes supporting the national roll-out of the cervical screening programme.  We remain persuaded as to the important role that HPV vaccination can play in preventing cervical cancer.  The evidence on this is clear.  Unfortunately, however, the finances require that we make these difficult choices.  I assure the House that we are fully committed to the introduction of a vaccination programme——

She acknowledged that the UK has had a screening programme for 20 years — our programme only commenced in September.  She failed to acknowledge she has been part of a Government which for almost 12 years failed to roll out the required programme despite regular promises that it would be put in place.Some 13 European countries have now made provision for a cervical cancer immunisation programme.  Such programmes will start shortly in a number of other European countries.  The Minister's cancellation of the immunisation programme announced in August will ensure that in future years we will continue to have a bad record on cervical cancer.Having announced the immunisation programme last August, the Minister attempted last night to diminish its importance, stating that every young woman who does not get the vaccine would be offered a screening programme.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children played the same game.  However, screening is a second best alternative.  As both Ministers and the Taoiseach should know, prevention is better than cure.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	768	In the Dáil this morning, the Taoiseach callously and hysterically dismissed Deputy Kenny's call for the immunisation programme to be reinstated to protect the lives of women.  He also made reference to the screening programme.  In non-clinical terms, it seems the Government regards it as acceptable that women develop pre-cancerous and cancerous cells, and that they be denied a life-saving vaccine.  We now know that had the vaccine been available a number of years ago, of the 93 deaths from cervical cancer in 2004, 52 would not have occurred.The Minister for Health and Children herself acknowledged that two particular forms of the HPV virus cause 70% of cervical cancers and that the vaccine prevents these two particular strains.  The essential ethos of a national cancer strategy should not merely be detection and treatment but also prevention where possible.  At a time of financial stringency, it seems that this Government is now prepared to sacrifice the lives of women on the altar of political expediency.The Minister has made much of her need to identify €700 million in cuts for next year.   She has annually costed the immunisation programme at €10 million.  An extra six cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes, as part of a cancer strategy, would provide the funds required by the Minister for this programme annually.The Minister is right when she said it is about making choices.  She made the right choice in August when announcing the start-up of the vaccination programme, but made the wrong choice in doing a U-turn to cancel the programme in October.  The truth is that this Government has no moral compass and no commitment to a recognisable value system.I do not believe in demonising the Minister but she and her colleagues have been in Government for so long that they are incapable of making the right choices, are out of touch and institutionalised.  Detached decisions are made which impact on the lives of real people with whose plight this Government cannot identify.  It is a morally bankrupt Government that agrees to deny to young girls a vaccine that it acknowledges will prevent cervical cancer.  It is incomprehensible that we have a Minister for Health and Children who can describe herself as a strong proponent of a life-saving vaccine and then announce and defend her cancellation of the programme to administer it.This is essentially about an immunisation programme for children.  Has any thought been given to the rights of these children?  There is an extraordinary hypocrisy in a Government engaging in cross-party discussions for a children's rights amendment to the Constitution while simultaneously denying to children life-saving immunisation.  This is a Government engaged in serial and tragic incompetence on an epic scale.  That incompetence was clearly illustrated in the embarrassing contribution of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, who attempted to defend the indefensible.  It is clear that in the context of his child protection duties, the Minister of State completely failed to play any meaningful role in Cabinet when this scandalous and indefensible decision was made.

Voting on this motion is not about party politics, but moral values.  It requires all of us as politicians to make moral choices which go beyond party political allegiance or obligations to obey the party Whip.  The challenge for Government Deputies is to act as legislators and support Fine Gael's motion, or to abdicate their constitutional responsibilities and simply behave as lobby fodder.In making their decision, they should reflect on the reality that there are few Members in this House who have not experienced the tragedy and trauma of the death of a close relation or friend as a consequence of cancer.  They should ask themselves whether they want to vote to condemn others to such a death.  It is time for the Deputies opposite, for once, to display both courage and responsibility.

Last August, practically everyone in this House, including myself, welcomed the Minister's announcement.  We were disappointed there was not to be a catch-up programme for 13 to 15 year olds but we welcomed the fact that 12 year olds would be able to avail of this vaccine.The Minister and the Government are full of contradictions on this issue.  They have blamed the economic downturn as the reason this vaccination programme is not proceeding.  Yet the announcement was made by the Minister four weeks after the emergency mini-budget or financial announcements in July and four weeks before the announcement that the budget would be presented earlier than planned.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced that the budget would be early, he said that in July the Government also made it clear that additional economies would be required in the event of a further fiscal deterioration.  I do not think there was a person in this country in early August who did not realise that our fiscal position was going to deteriorate further and I do not think the Minister for Health and Children thought that either when she made her announcement.  In August we knew the economy was in tatters and still the Minister made her announcement.In her contribution to the debate last night and to which Deputy Shatter also referred, the Minister said we live in a country where our cancer outcomes are not what they should be.  How is the decision she has made going to improve our cancer outcomes?  It will do anything but improve it.  The Minister said she is seeking to reorganise services for patients who already have cancer and this is welcomed by everybody.  However, what about the issue of prevention?I cannot understand how she can claim to be a strong proponent of the vaccine while at the same time refuse to supply it to 12 year olds.  The main economic contradiction in the Minister's speech was when she stated that if it were a once-off sum of money, it would not have been a difficult decision but that it represents an ongoing sum of money for this year, next year and the year after.  She then referred to Dr. Reilly's point that the companies were willing to defer payment for the first year.  In response she stated the decision was not to introduce it in 2009.  That is the first year.  She could have gone ahead with it, based on what was being offered by the pharmaceutical companies yet she said earlier it was a year on year decision.  Which is it?I agree it is important to have a national screening programme but neither of the programmes are mutually exclusive and both are needed because the use of both is what delivers the best outcomes.  Our record on cervical cancer is not good and this decision will not change it.The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, said last night in her contribution that this is a cancer which affects younger women more than many other forms of cancer, younger women who have children, commitments and responsibilities.  Today's 12 year olds are tomorrow's younger women, whom I hope will be given the chance to have those children, have those commitments and have those responsibilities.  I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, that this is a children's issue because those children of today and tomorrow want to have their mothers around with them.

I am sure everyone would have offered to do anything in the world to prevent them from dying or to prevent them from going through that treatment.  We have an opportunity to do just that in the case of this one form of cancer that is preventable by vaccination yet the Government is turning its back on that opportunity.  I do not believe the Minister thinks this is right.  Even if it means a few less sod-turnings and a few less foundation stones being laid and a few less official openings for the HSE across the country, let us put this vaccine in place.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I thank the people who have contributed to this debate.  This is a highly emotive issue and rightly so.  We are at a moral crossroads when we as a nation put fiscal rectitude and budgetary considerations ahead of the lives of our children and ahead of the lives of a future generation.  There are two wonders here: the wonder that we have a vaccine against cancer which is the only one I know of, and the wonder that we have a Government which will not use it.This morning the Taoiseach told Deputy Enda Kenny that he was wrong when he said that 51 women would die from this illness if this vaccination programme did not go ahead.  This is clearly not so.  Deputy Kenny quoted from a document which I have referred to on many occasions, the Health Information and Quality Authority assessment of benefit analysis of proceeding with this vaccine.  It is worth repeating the name of that agency, HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It states very clearly that out of 10,074 pre-cancers, 3,680 can be averted.  It states that out of 200 cases of cervical cancer annually, 111 can be averted.  It states that out of 93 deaths a year, 52 can be averted.  That means 52 women will not die if this vaccine is put in place.  How can the Minister ignore this stark advice from the Health Information and Quality Authority, which is supported in its conclusions by the Marie Keating Foundation, the National Immunisation Advisory Board, the World Health Organisation, the European Cervical Cancer Organisation, the Irish Family Planning Association, the Well Woman Centre, and many others?  The Taoiseach is rubbishing his own Health Information and Quality Authority report.  Furthermore, an attempt has been made to make this argument into an issue of either screening or cervical cancer vaccination.  It never was, it still is not and it will never be a question of either-or.  It will always be a case of both cervical cancer vaccination and screening if we are to rid our island of this scourge.The Taoiseach made the point this morning that vaccination has never preceded screening in any other country.  This is disingenuous.  In many other countries, screening has been available for 40 years and it is a damning indictment of this country and this Minister and this Government, that it has only been brought out in the past year, when it started in the mid-west ten years' ago.  The fact the vaccine has only been available in the past two years answers the question why it has never preceded the screening programme.The Daily Mail has a map which shows all the countries in Europe——

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	787	The Taoiseach was wrong when he said that 3,680 pre-cancers cannot be averted.  He was wrong when he said that 111 cancers cannot be avoided.  It is particularly the Taoiseach who is wrong when he replied to Deputy Kenny this morning that 51 deaths would not be averted.  In fact, there will be 52 deaths, according to HIQA, his own Health Information and Quality Authority.A Member said here today that Fine Gael is being populist.  I will be populist every time if it saves lives.  The decision of this Government to deprive women of the facility of cervical screening is an indictment, particularly during a period of economic boom.  We have asked where this money could be found.  HIQA has said the vaccination programme could be done for €9.7 million.  The Minister is trying to tell us we cannot find €10 million out of €16,000 million.  What about the bonuses for the HSE bosses, the consultancy fees for PPARS, the €110 million in legal fees, the €300 million on travel in the HSE?  These are just some of the areas in which a less lazy Minister for Health and Children might have looked before she picked on the elderly, the disabled and the young.  With regard to e-voting machines, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, commented, "What is €50 million in the overall scheme of things?".  That would pay for five years of this programme.It boils down to a Government and its priorities, a society and its morals.  This is not the island that Pádraig Pearse died for or for which Éamon de Valera and Michael Collins risked their lives.  This is not an Ireland that leaves the weak behind and exposes our young people like this Government wishes to do.  Even in Famine times, neighbours helped each other out.  What has gone wrong with this Government that it can allow itself become so detached, that it becomes consumed by fiscal rectitude and everything else takes second place?Deputy McDaid spoke earlier and I commend him and I hope he will vote for this motion and go the whole way rather than halfway up the road.  Members on the opposite side of the House may be looking into his or her daughter's eyes in a few years and explaining why her best friend has cervical cancer because he or she would not take action to protect her, or why the wife of his or her son may have cervical cancer.  We in this House all know that we will vaccinate our children — we will protect our children.  Again, it will be the poor who will lose out.  We are at a defining moment.  Just when we think the Government cannot sink any lower, it scores another own goal.  If one believes in equality, social inclusion and social justice, this should be a case of one for all and all for one, as it is across the map of Europe, which I demonstrated.  However, if the motion falls tonight, it is clearly a case that this Government believes in an "I'm all right, Jack" approach to the children of today and the women of tomorrow.

The Bill displays no imagination regarding how to get people off social welfare and, more important, back to work, particularly through retraining and education.  It represents a missed opportunity and social welfare recipients must wait for 12 months before they can retrain or upskill.  The new 1% income levy on 2.1 million workers and pensioners demonstrates a lack of support when it is needed most.  Many Members have referred to the Bill's provisions but I would like to refer to a wider issue.  I am incensed about the €10 air travel tax on business travellers and tourists using airports on the western seaboard.  I use Knock Airport at all times because it is my local airport.  A €10 levy is charged currently, which I supportively pay.  However, the new €10 tax is anti-western seaboard and anti-rural airports.The Government has failed to protect the most vulnerable even though 300,000 people live in consistent poverty.  Many people are deprived and live in local authority housing which is not properly insulated and which does not have proper heating infrastructure.  It is galling sometimes that they must go to the local shop or co-operative to lug briquettes and coal back to the house and pay between €80 and €100 every time just to keep the house warm.  They are in a no-win situation.  It must be ensured they are not deprived of basic necessities such as heating, food and clothing.  More than 700,000 people are at risk of poverty and live on incomes of less than €200 per week.Aspects of the legislation are good.  The Government rolled back on its decision regarding the 1% levy to exempt those earning less than the minimum wage, which is welcome.  It is disappointing, however, that the threshold was not increased in order that low earners would be exempt from the tax.The price of food and non-alcoholic beverages has increased by 6.1% while the price of gas, water, electricity and other fuels has increased by 12%.  Health, education and transport costs have also increased by 4%, 6% and 6.5%, respectively, but social welfare payments will increase by the minimum and they will not keep pace with inflation.  The State pension will increase by €7 per week, which is welcome, but the programme for Government promised that pensions would be €300 per week by 2012, which is not achievable.  If the Minister of State can convince us otherwise, I will be delighted.  I refer to energy poverty.  In 2005, 6% of the population went without heating at some stage due to lack of money.  Fr. Seán Healy identified a strong correlation between energy poverty and the standard of housing and 2,000 winter deaths annually.Post-primary school transport charges have increased.  At the beginning of the year, it cost a family with two children in the junior cycle €198 to send them to school by public transport.  Within five months, there were four increases and the cost increased to €600.  This is not only anti-family, it is also anti-rural.  Good public transport is available in cities and most parents have no option but to use it.  The cost has increased by 203% in five months, which is exorbitant.  Unfortunately, this is an attack on rural-based families.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science should examine this to ensure no other increases are applied because most people will be unable to avail of public transport if the cost continues to increase.The 1% levy is expensive.  New applicants for jobseeker's benefit will need 104 rather than 52 paid contributions to be considered eligible.  From January the benefit will be limited to 12 months for current claimants with 260 or more social insurance contributions.  People must be upskilled in order that they can return to the workplace but the Bill does not address that.The airport tax is anti-western seaboard.  There are airports in Kerry, Shannon, Sligo, Knock and Galway.  I flew from Dublin to Manchester last Saturday evening and a €2 levy was applied but when I fly from Knock to Manchester, the levy is €10.  That issue needs to be addressed.  It is not related to the legislation but it is anti-west of Ireland and it should be addressed immediately.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	800	The Bill is necessary to implement the changes announced in budget 2009.  Spending on social welfare will increase by almost €2.6 billion to more than €19.5 billion in 2009.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has ensured €515 million worth of improvements in social welfare rates will be introduced in the upcoming year.  Ireland is experiencing grave economic times compared to previous budgets.  The Government has made difficult and unpopular decisions to secure our economic future but it was necessary to do so to help us out of these difficult times.  If we wanted to be popular and populist, we would not have taken the course we did but it is the responsibility of government to govern.Increases in rates of payment set out in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are broadly in line with inflation and thus, hopefully, will maintain the real value of social welfare payments.  More than 1.7 million men, women and children will be recipients of these welfare payments — 440,000 pensioners, 345,000 ill and disabled persons, over 80,000 carers, 30,000 low-income working families availing of the family income supplement and over 580,000 families who receive child benefit payments.  That is a significant number of people who have been taken into consideration by the Government.The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, stated that this coming year will see an increase of €7 per week for all State pensioners, contributory and non-contributory, along with carers aged 66 and over.  Increases for qualified adults ranges from €4.30 to €6.30 per week for those aged over 66.  These changes will mean that a pensioner couple will have a weekly increase of €13.30 per week.  We, in Government, have always been committed to ensuring that our pensioners are looked after.  I welcome the Minister's announcement last night that she aims to announce a framework for future pensions policy by the end of the year.Over €260 million extra is targeted to support people of working age who are claiming jobseeker's benefit or allowance, which increases by €6.50 per week to €204.30 per week from January 2009.  Overall, some 733,000 people are in receipt of working age payments — jobseekers, one-parent families, those claiming illness benefit and disability allowance, as well as carers — will all benefit from increases in weekly personal rates in the coming year.The earning threshold for family income supplement is to increase by €10 per child, which gives an increase of up to €6 per week per child.  For those in receipt of social welfare payments with children, the qualified child increase rises from €24 to €26 per week from January.  There is also an extension in the numbers eligible to claim the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  That is most welcome as the period before school commences is a financially difficult time for many parents.The Minister also announced a number of changes in qualifying criteria for jobseekers benefit entitlement, which is being reduced from 15 to 12 months for recipients with 260 or more contributions and duration of less than six months.  Where a person has less than 260 paid contributions, the benefit will now only be available for nine months instead of 12 months.  A new change coming in January 2009 is the increase in the number of paid contributions required to qualify for jobseekers benefit, illness benefit and health and safety benefit, from 52 to 104.A €13 to €18 per week increase is being initiated as the minimum contribution for people on rent supplement or in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  This will bring the personal contribution more into line with the level of rents paid by tenants in local authority accommodation on similar income levels.In total, the new expenditure control measures contained in the social welfare budget will amount to net savings of €124.9 million when compensatory measures are taken into account, and this is to be welcomed.  An issue that a number of my constituents have brought up is the entitlement of foreign nationals to welfare payments.  Migrants or young workers who have only worked here for a total of one year are entitled to claim jobseeker payments for 12 months without having to satisfy a means test.  However, appropriately, with these changed economic times, this will change from next January, when the number of required paid contributions will be doubled to 104 for new claimants.  We cannot discriminate against foreign nationals in our country.  They are entitled to claim legitimately in our country as we are in theirs.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	802	There are further developments coming in the jobseekers benefit.  Currently, one must have made 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year in order to qualify for illness benefit.  In contrast, this condition does not exist for jobseeker's benefit, with the result that people who may not have paid PRSI contributions in the past number of years can qualify.  It is considered that this position does not adequately reflect the contribution-based rationale for social insurance and so, from next January, new claimants will be required to satisfy the same conditions as those on illness benefit and must have paid 13 contributions in the relevant tax year.Another expenditure control measure relates to the rent and mortgage interest supplements.  All claimants of these payments will be expected to make a personal contribution towards their accommodation costs from their own resources, and I agree wholeheartedly with this.  This rate of €13 per week has not been increased since January 2004, despite the fact that the lowest rate of social welfare payment has risen by almost €70 per week since then.  As of 1 January 2009, the minimum personal contribution to rent and mortgage interest supplement is being increased by €5 per week.  With approximately 72,000 people in receipt of rent and mortgage interest supplements, this measure is expected to generate €19 million per annum from 2009 onwards.

At this time when it is imperative that public expenditure be strictly controlled in the national interest, the Government's commitment to an increased provision for social welfare is an unequivocal statement of the Government's intent to protect the less well-off in society.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	807	I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan.I am pleased to contribute to this important Bill, which is central to the way we run our business and which allows us to raise crucial issues on the economy.  There are many issues which I would have liked to deal with but I will focus on the following.We live in a time when unemployment is increasing rapidly.  Week in, week out across the country jobs are being lost in various industries.  With so many unemployed, a matter which has come to my attention, and at which the Government needs to look, is the pressure on older people.  While the fair deal Bill has been published and is ready to be debated, we need to address the training of people with skills in keeping older people living in their communities.I was taken aback recently by the amount of people who have come to me who have difficulties regarding their parents, uncles, aunts and neighbours who wish to live in the community.  At a time when there are vast numbers of people unemployed, many women would take up the role of carers to such people.  However, we lack such provision.  The budget, and this Bill, was an ideal opportunity to do something.  Rather than pay people unemployment benefit, we should be doing something to help our older people.  From what I read of the new fair deal, it is cumbersome and it will involve a significant cost to the taxpayer.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to look at that in the near future because it could have a significant impact on many ordinary people.  I have also spoken about the fuel allowance which should cover a longer period.  We have wetter, colder and longer winters and this year is particularly bad.  Although some oil companies have reduced the cost of fuel, we still have the dearest fuel in Europe.  The cost of a barrel of oil has dropped substantially but the consumer is still charged a large amount for oil.  The fuel allowance does not go far enough to help our older people.  I know we are living in harsh economic times but I implore the Minister to examine this matter.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and my colleague for sharing time.  In the time available, one can only deal with small aspects of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  One would prefer to have a longer debate which would befit important legislation such as this.From time to time, we all need to be reminded that the purpose and duty of social welfare is to alleviate the impact of hardship on those who are vulnerable.  While I agree with the need to cull abuses and fraud, it should never be allowed to be a means to deprive people of their rightful entitlements.  I do not want to settle old scores but one issue takes me to the fair and this is the habitual residence clause which was introduced originally by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make it difficult for non-nationals in this country and was taken up by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The founding father of Fianna Fáil was born outside this country.  He was born in Brooklyn as was a former member of my party and Minister, Richard Burke.  If they had to seek State services such as social welfare or health services they would not qualify.  They would be deprived because they would have to establish residency.  People whose parents emigrated from here 25 or 30 years ago and who have returned to their homeland have been refused supplementary welfare, disability allowance and various means tested allowances on the basis of habitual residency.  It is appalling.I wish to discuss another old practice with regard to supplementary welfare for which another Minister has partial responsibility.  It is not all the fault of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and this is not a criticism of her.  However, she knows this happens.  If a couple who separate but have not gone through the legal process of separation have a mortgage, the mortgage must be paid or else they must both leave the house.  If the wife remains in the house and applies for supplementary welfare in the form of rent support, she receives 50% of what is due to her because allegedly and theoretically the spouse has a 50% interest in the house.  However, this has not been determined and the courts might decide otherwise.I cannot understand why the Department should punish a person in these circumstances.  I know responsibility for this is jointly shared with the Department of Health and Children which carries out the functions.  However, there is no basis, legal or otherwise, for depriving the person in the house of full rent support.  All that happens is that they lose the house and end up out on the road.  They are subjected to hardship while slowly but surely and inexorably the law in implemented.  They may have children.  Why do we not cater for people in this situation?We know about the regulations and guidelines.  I ask the Minister to take a grip of the situation and deal with these two aspects because great hardship is being caused to a large number of people who ordinarily would have an entitlement but they are deprived by either the habitual residency clause or a stupid interpretation of the regulations by another Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	809	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí uilig a labhair ar son agus i gcoinne an Bhille seo.  D'fháiltigh iad siúd a labhair i gcoinne na reachtaíochta roimh de sonraí an Bhille.  Chuir siad go mór leis an díospóireacht.  It is significant that so many people on both sides of the House chose to speak on this Bill, recognising its significance.  It is possibly the only and most important Bill any Minister for Social and Family Affairs gets to introduce during the year, particularly because it contains so many positive measures.  After all, this is the Bill which gives legislative effect to the changes brought about in the budget.Never has so much money been spent on social welfare in this country and in recent years we have not had a need for this amount of money.  Given the economic context in which we find ourselves, nationally and internationally, it is important not only to make provision but to ensure our expenditure is kept under control as far as possible while ensuring we do not attack in any way the most vulnerable or penalise those who do not deserve to suffer.  What we have done in the budget and in this Bill is a fair balance in this regard.Of total Government expenditure for the year, €19.6 billion is a large amount.  Notwithstanding the difficulties, we will have an increase of €2.6 billion next year, which represents a 15.5% increase on the Estimates allocation for 2008.  As Deputies pointed out, it includes the money necessary to provide for the increase in the live register.  The Government's priority is to ensure we keep unemployment as low as possible, create employment, get people back to work as quickly as possible and keep them at work.People who lose their jobs need to turn to social welfare for income support.  In anticipating an average of 290,000 people on the live register during next year we had to make provision for it.  The increases in this alone account for €1.25 billion of the planned increases in spending next year and this is a large amount of money.  Notwithstanding this, and recognising older people and others depending on social welfare also needed increases to help them cope with the changing circumstances, we managed to put together a budget package of €515 million.Deputies opposite have stated it is not as good as recent years and it is not but neither are the economic circumstances.  We had to work within what we had.  Pensioners welcome the €7 increase they will receive.  The two week extension on the fuel allowance and the additional €2 have also been welcomed.  The extension by two weeks is making a difference to people and this is what they have indicated to us.  With regard to other payments, we try to do as much as we can for as many as possible but we must also target it.  It was more important to target the qualifying child of the unemployed worker or the person benefitting from family income support and put the increase there than it was to put it on child benefit generally which goes to people who do not need it in the same way.We showed our commitment to families by increasing the number of people who qualify for family income support and the improvement is significant.  A total of 18,000 more families will benefit from the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  I had to consider whether we would increase the amount of money or increase the number of families.  I chose to increase the number of families and this is an important distinction.

Deputy Shortall asked about the definition applicable to the one-parent family payment.  The provision in this Bill seeks to ensure that a category of unmarried persons who are currently excluded from eligibility for this benefit, via an anomaly in the legislation, will be included.  Under the current law, an unmarried claimant of one-parent family payment must be the parent of the qualifying child for whom he or she is claiming, whereas this requirement does not apply in the case of a separated or widowed person.  For example, if a brother who is unmarried takes over the care of his sibling, he is excluded from the one-parent family payment.  The purpose of the provision is to include such persons; it is not designed to exclude anybody.There has been much talk about lone parents.  We all accept that they are a particularly high-risk group, as are their children.  Whereas poverty indicators show that rates of poverty have decreased significantly for large groups of people in recent years, this has not happened to the same degree in the case of lone parents and their children.

I thank those Deputies on the Opposition benches who paid tribute to the departmental staff.  Some generous and well deserved comments were made in regard to their dealings with staff in local offices.  Following a review of staffing, we have placed additional personnel in the offices that were under particular pressure because of the increase in applications.  An additional 115 staff will be allocated shortly to those offices.  At all times our main concern is to ensure that those people who need social welfare support can access it efficiently and quickly.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	901	I am disappointed that it is some 11 and a half years since I first stood on my feet in the Dáil to forcefully request the then Minister for Health and Children to make rapid progress with the plans for phase 2B of Mullingar General Hospital, which facilitates the significantly increased population of two counties, namely, Longford and Westmeath.  Phase 2A was completed in June 2007 and I am compelled tonight on behalf of the constituents of Longford-Roscommon and Westmeath to raise the issue and their deeply held concerns over the tardiness and slowness of progress with the completion of phase 2B of Mullingar Regional Hospital.In 2006, we were informed that the unit would be opened towards the end of 2007.  We were then told phase 2B, stage 1, which was scheduled again and subdivided, would be completed in 2008, with same having been commenced formerly on 24 October 2006.  The completion of this phase of the project will increase the bed complement from 215 to 244.  I acknowledge that an additional €4.6 million was allocated to allow the refurbishment of the remaining existing wards, including a medical and surgical ward on level O and a delivery and gynaecology ward on level 2.There are also plans to fit out of the existing ward shells in line with the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, guidelines to provide a new paediatric ward on level O, a new day surgery and gynaecology ward on level 1, a new obstetric ward on level 2, and a new medical ward, incorporating an acute stroke level unit on level 3.Phase 2B — stage 1 will also see the existing paediatric and obstetric wards in line with SARI guidelines to provide a surgical ward on level 1 and a medical ward and palliative care unit on level 3, which is very important and has been demanded.  I pay tribute to the work of the North Westmeath Hospice which is very valuable.The existing facilities at level O will be extended to accommodate an interim special care baby unit, adjacent to the new paediatric ward.  The road, car parking, drainage and other associated works will be completed by the end of December 2008 and should open in early 2009, which is very welcome, even if the completion is somewhat belated.This small piece of good news is subject to qualifications.  The staff are left to ascertain if the appropriate complement of additional staff will be provided, but despite the hospital having submitted a manpower plan to the HSE, it is still awaiting developments and outcomes in this regard especially with reference to the provision of the necessary additional staff complement.I seek clarification on the plans for stage two of phase 2B, which originally included the following: a new acute psychiatric department, additional beds in the medical assessment unit, additional day beds, a separate coronary care unit, a separate intensive care unit, new medicine for elderly and rehabilitation units and replacement child and adolescent psychiatric unit, replacement of theatres, a replacement pathology department, a replacement occupational therapy unit, extended catering facilities and new central staff changing facilities.  I want clear answers tonight, which is why I was sent here by my constituents.Is it true that the new acute psychiatric unit, which was to be built as part of the phase 2B capital development accommodation at Mullingar General Hospital, is being scrapped?  If so, why is there such a fundamental change in policy and a clear reneging on commitments solemnly given to the people of Longford and Westmeath?  Is the Minister going to expect patients who require such a service to be transferred to either Naas or Portlaoise under the PCCC area plan?  There is clearly no transport network available and this would interfere with the seamless nature of the treatment afforded to patients at St. Loman's Hospital. This illustrates the illogicality of any such plan or policy at this stage.  I want an assurance that there will be no new acute psychiatric unit in Mullingar General Hospital, and that the patients will remain at St. Loman's Hospital and avail of the excellent facilities provided by the staff there.As if this is not bad enough, I understand that the second stage of phase 2B, which will increase the bed complement to 313, has been subjected again to an independent cost benefit analysis.  We all know that this would recommend that the work proceed.  This must be the most over analysed, evaluated and scrutinised project ever to take place in Ireland, yet it has now been referred to the national hospital capital steering committee, and formal confirmation is awaited from the committee concerning the status of this development.  How many times do we have to have a project, now about 12 years in gestation, subjected to internal analyses and evaluation?  Does the Government keep opting for evaluations in the hope of getting a negative analysis?  We all know that could not or never will happen, as this hospital project is vital for the population of Longford and Westmeath.I also understand the HSE board is finalising its capital funding budget plans tomorrow for 2009 and the Minister will have this plan by the end of the week.  I call upon her to ensure that the necessary funding of €36 million is provided in the budget to allow the second stage of phase 2B to proceed.  She should then ensure that it is opened in 2009 or early 2010, which is about 13 years after it should have been completed at a fraction of the cost that will now be incurred.I hope that the manpower plan which must accompany the infrastructural development will not be left lying on a desk within the HSE, as it is vital that the additional necessary complement of staff is also provided at that stage to enable the extra facilities to be properly staffed when it is opened.Four years ago we took to the streets in Mullingar to show our displeasure at the shoddy way in which residents in Longford and Westmeath were being treated by the Government in the provision of essential health services we deserve.  We will not accept any more half truths, obfuscation, side-stepping, or bureaucratic replies.  The time for action has long since passed.  Our patience has been exhausted, and if the Minister does not give a positive reply, the Labour Party will bring the people back on the streets of Mullingar and to the gates of Dáil Éireann to fight with our feet for what is rightfully ours.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	902	I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.Stage one of the phase 2B capital development at Mullingar began in October 2006 and is scheduled to be completed next month.  The completion of this phase of the project, costing over €23 million, will increase the bed complement at the hospital from 215 to 244, which is an increase of 29 beds.  This phase of the project includes a fit-out of the existing ward shells to provide a new paediatric ward, a new day surgery and gynaecology ward, a new obstetric ward and a new medical ward, incorporating an acute stroke unit; refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards to provide surgical and medical wards and a palliative care unit; an extension of the existing facilities to accommodate an interim special care baby unit adjacent to the new paediatric ward; and substantial completion of the proposed infrastructural road and car park network, together with any associated drainage works and utility diversions.  The Health Service Executive has advised that these works are completed and that the ward areas are now fully occupied.In addition, the HSE also granted approval for the refurbishment of two further wards in the existing hospital, that is, a medical and surgical ward and a delivery and gynaecology ward.  This work is due to be completed next month.With regard to stage 2, the HSE, in drawing up its capital programme, is required to prioritise the capital infrastructure projects to be developed within its overall capital funding allocation under the national development plan.  This must take account of the NDP targets for the division of capital investment between the acute and primary, community and continuing care pillars.  The HSE is currently considering its capital plans from 2009 onwards, and these will soon be submitted to the Department of Health and Children for consideration and approval in the normal way.  Details on individual projects will be made available when the capital plan is approved.

#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	904	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter on the Adjournment.  When discussing the successful capture by the Naval Service of the yacht Dances with Waves off the coast of south-west Cork on “Today with Pat Kenny” last Friday, the Minister for Defence referred to the previous unsuccessful attempt to import drugs from the yacht Lucky Day 17 months earlier.  He stated:There is a kind of perception abroad that the previous huge seizure 17 months ago that you mentioned there in west Cork around the same area was something that was more or less stumbled upon by accident.  That is not true.  I mean, that had been tracked also.  That is not widely known that it had been widely tracked also.As the minister stumbled over his words, he went on to state:It would probably would have been taken, arrested and taken into custody, had the accident not happened which precipitated the action on the part of the officials here.I do not know whether the Minister was still dreaming or just inventing a bit of revisionist history at that hour of the morning, but I would like to know where did he come up with this fairy tale.It totally contradicts the statements by everyone else involved in this matter, including senior Garda officers who, on the day, described the capture as "an act of God".  It also contradicts the evidence given by Commander Gene Ryan of the Naval Service in the trial of some of those charged and convicted over these events.  In an interview with the "News at One" on RTE Radio 1 on 23 July 2008 at the conclusion of the trial, Commander Ryan explained how he traced the journey of the yacht from the records of two satellite phones recovered from the stricken RIB in Dunlough Bay, with the specialist technical help from the Iridium satellite phone company, and which involved many thousands of man hours to plot the history of their movements.  It also contradicts the statement by Customs and Excise official Mr. Brian Smyth at the joint task force press conference last week, when he likened the illegal transportation of the massive volume of cocaine to the shipment which was fortuitously intercepted off the west Cork coast last year.The new European maritime analysis and operation centre for narcotics only became operational on 25 July 2007, three weeks after the Dunlough Bay event.  I have heard of delays in the operation of Government organisations all my political life, but I have never heard of one beginning before its starting date.Will the Minister confirm that neither the Garda, the Naval Service, nor Customs and Excise were tracking the movements of the yacht named Lucky Day before 2 July 2007?  Will he confirm that neither he nor any State agency, including the Garda, the Naval Service and Customs and Excise were aware that any other agency was tracking this vessel before 2 July 2007?  Will he also confirm that there was no Garda, Customs and Excise or Naval Service operation in progress on 2 July 2007 to monitor the movements of this vessel and its occupants or the activities of others on land, which led to the arrest of the four men subsequently convicted or others who may have been involved in this illegal attempt to import drugs into this country before the communications received from the local coast guard unit to a member of the Garda on 2 July 2007?  Will the Minister also congratulate the professional work and expertise of the Coast Guard unit, which arrived first on the scene and raised the alarm with the authorities?The Minister for Defence often has a great turn of phrase, but in this case I think we can call it "premature recollection".

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	908	I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this important matter in the House.  I should start by saying that the Minister is only answerable to this House concerning An Garda Síochána.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	909	The Minister for Defence answered Pat Kenny.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	910	Investigations are still ongoing on this matter, albeit in other jurisdictions, and the Minister is still restricted as to what he can say about this particular case.  On top of that, the Minister firmly holds the view that he should not openly disclose the intelligence that may or may not be available to members of An Garda Síochána at any particular time, or what action is taken on foot of that intelligence.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to go into specific operational details of the kind sought by the Deputy.What is a matter of public record is that the joint task force of An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service, and the Naval Service worked extremely well together in the investigation that followed the seizure in Dunlough Bay and this resulted in four successful convictions in Ireland.The Minister would like once again to commend the work of the joint task force last week in Operation Seabight.  This operation involving An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, working closely with our international partners in the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon, is an example of what can be achieved when we collaborate and work together for the common good.  The Minister is grateful for the strong support for the operation in this house.The subject of this Adjournment matter specifically relates to the interdiction of drugs at sea, but we should not overlook the fact that when drugs find their way into the country considerable efforts are made by An Garda Síochána to track these down and seize them.  In 2007, the total amount of drugs seized had an estimated street value of €155 million.  As of 11 November, this year's seizures have already amounted to €203 million.  Of necessity, figures for 2008 are provisional.  While some would argue that this means there are more and more drugs coming into Ireland, it could also be that our law enforcement agencies are obtaining better intelligence and are getting better at detections and seizures.The Minister has been advised by the Garda authorities that in addition to the considerable volumes of drugs which continue to be seized, of which last week's huge cocaine haul is further evidence, significant impact has been made in 2008 by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in drug trafficking through the importation, sale and distribution of drugs.Obviously there is little room for complacency and this work is ongoing.  To further assist in our law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking, a number of new initiatives have been introduced.  Some examples of these include the establishment in January 2008 of the Garda organised crime unit on a permanent footing, which now has a full-time staff of 70 officers; the provisions introduced in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007, which have provided further measures to enhance the powers of the Garda Síochána in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences; the ring-fencing of €21 million in the 2009 Estimates to enable Operation Anvil to continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity throughout the country——

Established in 2007, the centre is focused on targeting the sea and air cocaine routes from Central and South America into the European Union.  It collects and analyses operational information, enhances intelligence through better information exchange, and ascertains the availability of assets to facilitate interdictions in accordance with the national laws of the countries involved.  The centre is an international and inter-agency co-ordination force, focused on intelligence exchange leading to the interdiction of large maritime and aviation drug shipments, and to the severing of links between transportation networks and the shore-based command and control personnel.Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Italy, France and the Netherlands are the founding members of the centre.  Europol, the European Commission and the US joint inter-agency task force south are observers at the centre.  Ireland has Garda and customs liaison officers based at the centre on a full-time basis.  The Naval Service appoints an officer to the centre for the duration of operations with Irish involvement.  This summer, Ireland became the first member state to ratify the international agreement establishing the centre.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is fully supportive of Irish participation in the centre.  The Minister is also supportive of all measures that involve practical co-operation and increase international co-ordination.The Minister wishes to assure the Deputy that he will continue to keep the measures for tackling all forms of drug trafficking under review.  The enforcement of the law on drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities and this is reflected in An Garda Síochána's policing plan for 2008.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	917	I sometimes wonder whether it is worth bringing motions like this before the House in order to get a response from the Government.  There is much frustration among many people in Ireland who are interested the Burma tragedy.  Organisations such as Burma Action Ireland and others are continually trying to raise the profile of what is happening in a country with a population in excess of 70 million, that continues to be run by a military dictatorship.I am glad in some ways that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is present as I expect he will know something about Burma, given his interest in foreign affairs as well as his own brief.  I ask him, however, not to read out a history lesson on Burma for us.  I would like to know what stance the Government thinks it can take, or is willing to take, in responding to what happened in Burma yesterday.  At least 14 — some reports say up to 23 — political prisoners were sentenced to 65 years in prison for so-called crimes of using electronic media — in other words, they are bloggers.  They were also charged with harming public tranquility and forming so-called illegal organisations.  In many cases, the latter are peaceful political organisations seeking democratic governance in their country.I have raised the issue of Burma on many occasions in various fora, including the European Parliament and on the floor of this House.  Just when it looks as if some progress is inching forward, however, the rulers in the military junta seem deliberately to give the international community the two fingers.  As recently as last month, the UN Security Council called for all political prisoners in Burma to be released.  We now have a new UN Secretary General who understands the political complications of this part of the world very well and has taken a personal interest in what is happening in Burma, or Mayanmar as it is known by some countries.  Yet we continue to get the kind of brutal response in the treatment of its own people.I wish to ask the Minister of State a number of questions.  I have read the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin's, response.  The words are strong but I would like to know what he will actually do to raise this issue at European Council level.  Will the EU's Common Position on Burma be changed?  Will he raise the matter in the context of future EU-ASEAN meetings?  Will he raise it with his counterparts in other EU countries who, in turn, can raise it at UN level?  In that way, the international community, through the UN Security Council — which is the ultimate arbiter of an international strategy towards Burma — can take a tougher stance and send stronger signals to a military dictatorship that seems to understand nothing else.There are strange but real connections between Ireland and Burma.  Many of the minority ethnic population there have had biographies of Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera translated into their own dialect.  This is to try to inspire hope for their struggle for independence.  I saw those books when I visited that part of the world.In addition, Irish aid agencies working in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border are doing fantastic work.  The Government, through Irish Aid, is sponsoring much of that humanitarian work.  We should try to get a serious response from the Government this time around.  We will raise in a determined fashion on the international stage the ongoing human rights consequences of what continues to happen in Burma in a way that will at least make some small difference.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	918	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  Like Deputy Coveney, the Government is deeply shocked by the severe sentences which were imposed on Burmese political activists by a closed military court yesterday afternoon.  On hearing news of the sentences, the Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately issued a statement on the matter.  The statement encapsulates the Government's position on the issue and states:I am appalled by the severity of the sentences imposed today on several respected political activists, whose sole crime has been to try to communicate to the outside world the truth about the conditions under which the people of Burma are living.  The 65-year sentences will mean that these courageous individuals face spending the rest of their lives in Burma's inhumane prison system.  This is yet another unacceptable, callous, act by a brutal regime that daily violates the basic human rights of the Burmese people and which will tolerate no voices seeking freedom and justice.  I have repeatedly made clear our Government's demand for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners and I will continue to work with my EU colleagues, with the UN and with the countries of the region to do all possible to accelerate our efforts in this regard.In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs contacted the French EU Presidency and other EU partners urgently seeking the issue of an EU statement on these events.  This statement, issued today, condemns the sentences and demands the immediate release of these and all political prisoners.  It also recalls the statement made by EU Foreign Ministers on Monday calling again for the lifting of restrictions placed on political parties in Burma and the early release of those under detention.  The Ministers also stated their view that the elections scheduled for 2010 will have no credibility unless all political prisoners are released unconditionally, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi, and a political process is initiated with the support of the United Nations on the basis of an inclusive, long-term dialogue in which the opposition and ethnic groups can participate fully.  It is estimated that at present over 2,000 political prisoners are under detention in Burma, often in appalling conditions.There is increasing concern for the worsening treatment which many of these prisoners face. NGOs have received reports from sources in Burma that the regime is now confining political prisoners to their cells without exercise periods and is stopping families from bringing them extra food and other supplies to top up the meagre food rations.  Most seriously, the regime appears to be systematically denying medical treatment to political prisoners, including to Aung San Suu Kyi.  Earlier this year, her doctor was refused permission to visit her over a three-month period.I note with great regret that the junta has detained even more political prisoners in the past weeks and months. Human Rights Watch has reported that 39 politically-motivated arrests were made in August and September, and more than 20 political prisoners were given jail terms.  Among those arrested in recent months was Ms Nilar Thein, a leading member of the 88 Generation Group, who was one of those sentenced yesterday afternoon.There has been a conspicuous absence of political progress in Burma since the events of 2007.  The military continues to repress monks, political activists and ethnic minorities.  The sentences handed down yesterday seem to confirm that the junta is determined to maintain an iron hold on the country, irrespective of the fact that elections will be held next year.The Government has long taken a strong, proactive stand on the appalling situation in Burma.  We would very much like to see the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, engaging on a personal level in the search for a solution and a more concerted, effective role by Burma's neighbours.  I am most grateful to have this opportunity to reiterate the Government's deep concern on this issue.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	920	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.When free education was introduced in 1967, it was realised and accepted by all that the minority Protestant population throughout the Republic had the right to have their children educated at a Protestant ethos school.  As a result, special arrangements were made to fund the limited number of Protestant schools in such a way that people living in isolated areas could be provided with boarding facilities where necessary and general support to allow them to survive on an equal basis with other public schools.  The difference between the funding for these schools and Catholic schools was that Catholic schools were available in most major towns in the country.  It is unreal that some 40 years later, the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, should use this budget situation to remove the €2.8 million necessary to support this structure or 30% of their support budget.I am specifically anxious about the future of two such schools in my constituency, the Collegiate School, which has been in Monaghan town since 1570, and the Royal School in Cavan, now celebrating its 400th anniversary.  They survived revolutions and two world wars but I wonder if they will survive this Minister.The Minister has stated the reason he removed this funding and increased the pupil-teacher ratio for Protestant schools as against Catholic schools is because of advice he received from the Attorney General that action might be taken against him by a Catholic school.  I believe this is an unreal and unrealistic excuse for him.  How was it that no action was taken against any Minister or school over the past 40 years?The change for either of these schools could mean a reduction in their budget from anywhere between €150,000 and €200,000 in a full calendar year, depending on how the regulations are implemented.  Is the Government prepared to offer the children of Cavan-Monaghan access to free education in a school of Protestant ethos?  Will the Government undertake that their children will have access to education opportunities that are not diminished because they go to the school of their choice?  Does the Minister realise that parents of children attending Protestant ethos schools have to financially support their schools so that they can be taught a diversity of subjects and are not disadvantaged?  Why are such parents being punished by the Government?The two schools I mentioned do not disadvantage pupils on a financial basis and all I am asking is that the problems of such schools are recognised and dealt with.  During Question Time, the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated: "I am well aware it will cause serious difficulties and I obviously have concerns about this."  He also stated at a later stage: "I recognise the special position of the Protestant schools."  However, he continued to argue that he was under pressure from the Attorney General and that the block grant which they were getting should be sufficient.However, as pointed out by Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the issue is much deeper than just one of education, although it manifests itself in education for historic reasons with which we are all familiar.  The Government's decision is really an attack on the principle of diversity within the Republic and the Minister is undermining a principle which we cherish in the South.  I fully endorse the comments made by Deputy Quinn.The Minister's attempt to rewrite history by suggesting that the only commitment was to pay a block grant is not true.  The commitment was to treat Protestant schools in the same way as schools going into the free scheme.  Forty years later, this is the first-ever breach of that commitment.  In fact, it was similar to a commitment given to the Protestant community at the foundation of the State that they would be able to choose a school which reflected their faith and ethos.  Even in the mid-1980s under former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, the then Government gave a special fixed 5% interest rate loan to rural-based Protestant boarding schools towards boarding provisions and other repairs and there was no word from the Attorney General.  The sum of money under consideration is small and the situation must be rectified.  Who were the people who advised the Minister?  Did they have a score to settle?

There is one such school in my constituency, namely, the Royal and Prior Protestant school in Raphoe.  It provides secondary education for the Protestant community in County Donegal and has been successfully doing so for many years.  The school is an amalgamation of two schools, including the Royal, which has a history going back 400 years since its foundation by royal charter by King James I in 1608.The school has an enrolment of approximately 500 pupils, which includes 30 or 40 boarders.  It is most concerned at the negative impact of educational cuts, particularly the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio and the new regulation concerning the employment of substitute teachers.  If the proposed cuts are implemented, the school will lose at least two teachers and this will have a negative impact on the number of subjects taught in the school and also the conducting of extra-curricular activities such as essential field trips for subjects such as geography.The Royal and Prior is a unique school providing the secondary educational needs of a religious minority within Donegal.  In view of its special role, I appeal to the Minister to exempt it from any cutbacks that would adversely affect its long and proud tradition of providing the highest standards of education, learning and citizenship, as it has done in Donegal for so many centuries.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	922	I am pleased to be given the opportunity to clarify for the House the position in regard to the withdrawal of certain grants from Protestant fee-paying schools.  The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, acknowledges the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging international economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources.With regard to the removal of certain support services grants received by Protestant fee-charging schools, the Minister wishes to re-emphasise that the Protestant block grant remains in place.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, this grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current school year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  It is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the central Protestant churches authority, which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, and the Government continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.  In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donogh O'Malley.  At the time, it was the payment of the block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from those Catholic schools that chose to continue to charge fees.It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue to the Department as a result of the withdrawal of certain support services grants from Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.  It is important to note that the purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  Rather, they covered a range of support services.  The Minister has had to take decisions on a number of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant block grant remaining in place, the Minister can see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question.I again thank the Deputies for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.

Since its introduction, gardaí have been operating 30,000 MAT checkpoints per month, thereby increasing the risk of being breathalysed.  As a consequence, there has been a noticeable downward trend in the number of deaths and collisions on our roads since August 2006.This downward trend, which has continued into this year, was achieved despite the fact there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of drivers and a 70 per cent increase in the number of vehicles on our roads over the period from 1997 to 2007.According to the European Road Safety Performance Index (PIN) programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, (ETSC), Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance.Automatic disqualification from driving applies to all drink driving convictions but the minimum period of disqualification varies depending on the alcohol levels in individual cases and on whether the conviction relates to a first or a subsequent offence.The Road Traffic Act 2006 also provides for the introduction of significant changes in relation to the minimum periods of disqualification following a conviction for intoxicated driving offences.

Over the past decade and more, we have had to tackle the twin challenges of addressing past underinvestment and phenomenal growth in transport demand, matching overall growth in the economy.This has been very much the case with regard to air infrastructure and especially the infrastructure at Dublin Airport. The Government is aware that in recent years the travel experience at Dublin Airport has been falling short of that experienced in other top class international airports, primarily because of capacity constraints.With the backing of the Government a major capital investment programme to improve, expand and modernise Dublin Airport is currently being implemented by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA). Under the ten-year programme DAA is investing €2 billion in new and improved facilities to create a much better airport for its customers.The major elements of that programme consist of improvements and expansions to the existing terminal, the construction of a new Terminal Two and the construction of a second runway to cater for increased aviation demand for the long run.The position with the other two main airports is that a new terminal was completed at Cork Airport in 2006. This has the capacity to cater for an expansion of passenger numbers from its current level of about 3 million to 5 million a year. As regards Shannon Airport, it continues to operate well within its infrastructural capacity.Major investments have been made in the past ten years in the national road network and the major inter-urban road programme linking Dublin with the other cities is now well advanced and on target for completion in 2010.  The implementation of national roads projects, including the construction and maintenance of such roads, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The National Development Plan also provides for substantial levels of investment in regional and local roads.Since the late 1990s, we have for the first time begun to invest seriously in public transport.  Transport 21 is a very concrete acknowledgement by the Government of the need to invest in our transport infrastructure.  Unique among capital programmes, it provides a ten year commitment to a very high level of investment in national roads, public transport and regional airports.Notwithstanding the current difficult economic climate, this Government is committed to continuing investment in the national transport infrastructure.  This is reflected in the provision in the 2009 Estimates of €2.4 billion for Transport 21 and €478 million for regional and local roads.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	925	I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 133 and 139 together.The enforcement on foreign registered drivers of penalties for road traffic offences is a complex legal and administrative matter for many States, and my Department is pursuing this question at European, British/Irish and North/South levels.We are working with the United Kingdom with the objective of having a bilateral agreement on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications in place early next year, under the framework of the relevant EU Convention.The mutual recognition of penalty points is however a longer term and much more difficult matter.  In particular it involves complex legal issues and will probably require the passage of primary legislation both here and in the United Kingdom in due course.  While both jurisdictions are working on this, it will be some time before a bilateral agreement can be put in place on this particular issue.In the meantime, although foreign licence holders do not have an Irish driving licence record, a separate record of any penalty points incurred by them in this State is kept in the National Driver File.  When the necessary arrangements are in place in relation to mutual recognition, this data will then be available for enforcement arrangements. Statistics in relation to road traffic offences that are not processed, due to the vehicle in question being a foreign registered vehicle, is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána.A proposal for a Directive on enforcement in the field of road safety is currently being discussed at Council Working Group level. This proposal does not relate to the mutual recognition of penalty points across the EU.Ireland was just one of many Member States that indicated, at the recent EU Council of Ministers meeting, that it has difficulties with the draft Directive.  Further proposals are being examined at present in an attempt to overcome these difficulties.All drivers are subject to road traffic law and enforcement is a matter for An Garda Síochána.  The realisation of any fines or penalties imposed by the Courts is a matter for the Courts Service.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	926	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 111 and 167 together.The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda Síochána may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person to submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.The current position regarding the testing of drivers for alcohol, at the scene of collisions, is that a member of An Garda Síochána may require a driver involved in a collision to provide a preliminary breath specimen.  This discretion is provided in acknowledgement of the fact that urgent medical attention for seriously injured victims must take precedence over breath testing.The Road Traffic Acts also place an obligation on a person to provide a blood or urine sample in a hospital.  This applies where an event occurs involving a vehicle which results in a person being injured, or a person claiming or appearing to have been injured, where the person is admitted to or attends a hospital, and a member of the Garda is of the opinion that, at the time of the event, the person had consumed an intoxicant.  An intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs or any combination of alcohol and drugs.Following the advice of the Attorney General on possible amendments to legislation, which continue to take overriding medical circumstances into account, this issue is included in the General Scheme of a Road Traffic and Transport Bill, which was recently approved for drafting by the Government.There is no feasible basis as yet in Ireland or in Europe for the introduction of a preliminary roadside test for drugs, such as at the scene of a road traffic collision, as testing devices are still in the prototype stages. However, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area and is keeping me informed on the matter.

The driver licensing regulations, which were made in October 2007, providing for the introduction of a learner permit to replace the provisional licence and some other measures were the first step in the introduction of a Graduated Driver Licensing System.The other measures outlined in the Strategy for consideration, such as applying a restricted engine capacity to car learner permit holders and in the first two years after acquiring a full driving licence, would require the enactment of either primary legislation, secondary legislation or a combination of both primary and secondary legislation.  A progressive roll-out of appropriate measures is envisaged as the most practical approach for implementing the Graduated Driver Licensing System.   These measures will be considered by me on the basis of proposals received from the Road Safety Authority.The Road Safety Authority is currently preparing a consultation paper for issue shortly in which it will be seeking the views of stakeholders and the public on the application of further graduated driving licensing measures to learner drivers and to drivers in the first two years after acquiring a full driving licence.  I look forward to receiving from the Road Safety Authority in due course the proposals which will emerge from that process.

As regards these latter studies, I have asked that they also take into consideration the feasibility of bus rapid transit (BRT).The local authorities are making good progress on the light rail/bus rapid transit studies.  The Cork study is nearing completion and consultants will be appointed shortly to carry out the other studies.  My Department has had preliminary consultations with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and with the City and County Managers Association about the preparation of integrated transport and land use plans for the NSS Hubs and also for those NSS Gateways, which currently do not have land use and transport strategies in place.  The proposed Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan will include provisions in relation to the alignment of spatial planning and transport planning and will provide a policy context within which to proceed with the preparation of land use and transport strategies for the Hubs and for the remaining Gateways.

The implementation of individual national road projects, including the provision of traffic calming measures, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.I understand from the NRA that they are about to publish the findings of a survey carried out on the effectiveness of traffic calming measures in the period 1997 to 2002.  The report compares road traffic collision data for the four years before and after the provision of traffic calming.  Overall, the figures show a welcome reduction in both the number and severity of collisions where traffic calming was provided.

I am satisfied with the roles being performed by the National Roads Authority and the local authorities in respect of identifying roads where safety is an issue and implementing road improvements.  I have no plans to initiate an audit of road surfaces or to propose new legislative measures in this area.  I have no function in relation to the Health and Safety Authority.

The policy will outline an integrated and wide-ranging suite of measures which will aim to develop a culture of cycling in Ireland by 2020, with 10% of all trips by bike in line with my previously stated aim.  In so far as the Sutton to Sandycove Cycle Route is concerned, the provision of this route is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.I recognise the value of the project in the contexts of road safety and the promotion of a culture of cycling and, as announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the recent Carbon Budget, I will assist my colleague in delivering a special cycling package for Dublin in 2009 to include funding for work on the city centre portion of the proposed Sutton to Sandycove Cycle Route.

The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Under Transport 21, a budget of €1.44 billion has been allocated to the NRA for 2009.  The focus for the year will continue to be on the delivery of the Major Inter-urban routes (MIUs), which are on target for completion by 2010.  I understand from the NRA that they are currently in the process of drawing up their programme of works for next year based on their allocation of €1.44 billion.  It would be inappropriate to comment on specific projects pending the outcome of that exercise.The 2009 Budget for national roads, while somewhat smaller than 2008, is still a significant amount and is a reflection of this Government's continued commitment to maintaining investment in transport infrastructure and services at a high level.  Clearly, however, the start and completion dates of national road projects which have not yet commenced will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current economic climate.

It is clear, at this stage, that the Plan will need to focus on areas such as — actions to reduce dependence on private car and to encourage smarter travel, actions to ensure that alternatives to car use are available through improving public transport, cycling and walking facilities, actions aimed at improving fuel efficiency of motorised transport, and actions aimed at strengthening institutional arrangements.I recognise that there has been a change in economic circumstances since the publication in February 2008 of the consultation document "2020 Vision — Sustainable Travel and Transport" and that lower economic growth will lead to lower growth in transport emissions.  This will be taken into account in the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan.Moving towards a sustainable travel and transport system will require a long-term programme of action and it is my view that such a programme must be adopted at the earliest possible time.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	939	As the Deputy will be aware, as Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.In 2007, the NRA completed an updated feasibility study, which built on an earlier 2001 study, which considered in particular the costs and benefits of what has become known as the Leinster Orbital Route.The updated NRA study, a copy of which was forwarded to my Department in March 2007, concluded that the Leinster Orbital Route linking Drogheda, Navan, Trim and Naas is strategically beneficial for the region in terms of strengthening the links between key development centres, assisting the economic development of these centres and improving the overall regional transport network.Neither Transport 21 nor the National Development Plan provides any funding for such a scheme to be constructed in the period to 2015.  The Government has already made it clear, under Transport 21, that priorities for the roads investment programme after the completion of the major interurban network in 2010, will be the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.The Minister for Finance has indicated his determination to seek to avoid any diminution in the capital provisions already made in the period to 2015 notwithstanding the current economic difficulties.  I would, however, like to make it clear that in this economic climate, further progress on long term projects such as this one will only be possible as and when resources become available.The Leinster Orbital Route proposal remains an important potential element of our longer-term infrastructure development.  My Department will continue to liaise with the roads and planning authorities concerned to ensure that route options are preserved free of impediment for this potential project.

The breakdown of this figure into individual modes of transport is not readily available.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	941	Under the State Airports Act 2004, the boards of Cork and Shannon airports are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.All three airport business plans have to be coordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by the Minister for Finance and myself. Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three state airports.On 5 November I was very pleased to be able to appoint persons of the calibre of Mr. Gerry Walsh, as Chairman, and Mr. Dick Lehane and Ms. Annette McNamara to the board of the Cork Airport Authority. They each bring different skills and experience to the work of the board of the Cork Airport Authority and I am confident that all three will make very valuable contributions to the future of Cork Airport.With the appointment of the Chair and Members of the Cork Board I now expect to be in a position to finalise my decisions in relation to the Airports Business Plans.

Work on the Dublin Port study is progressing well and I expect a final report for my consideration in early 2009.I have and continue to liaise closely with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with regard to Dublin Port.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is represented on the Steering Group of the Dublin Port Study. In turn my Department is represented on the Dublin Bay Task Force, established by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the chairmanship of the Dublin Regional Authority.In relation to the recent planning application by Dublin Port Company to An Bord Pleanála, the strategic infrastructure planning regulations list a number of "prescribed bodies" which must be informed of any applications.  In relation to this particular application, the Minister for Transport is such a prescribed body and I received a copy of the application. My Department has written to An Bord Pleanála updating the Board on the progress of the Dublin Port Study.Under the strategic planning regulations, the Board must seek further consultations from prescribed bodies in certain circumstances and as such I may be consulted further on the matter.

It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, and will encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area in a manner consistent with EU Regulation No. 1370/2007 on public service obligations and similar to the contractual framework used in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.Until the proposed legislation is enacted, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.The Government has committed to examining the need for a National Transport Regulator in the context of the overall review of the economic regulatory environment.  As part of the public transport regulatory reform programme, consideration is being given to the establishment of a national transport authority.The Public Transport Regulation Bill is included in the Government Legislative Programme in the list of Bills that have yet to be approved by Government.  It is my intention to seek Government approval to a General Scheme of the Bill before the end of the year with a view to publication in 2009.

While this amount is less than that provided in 2008 (€39.1 million) the 2008 allocation included a provision to reduce the driver testing backlog. This objective was achieved and the RSA is maintaining the driver test waiting time at 10 weeks.The 2009 level of Exchequer funding coupled with the fee income which the RSA earns will enable the Road Safety Authority to continue implementation of the Road Safety Strategy into 2009 and ensure that reductions in road fatalities secured in recent years are continued.While my Department provides annual funding to the Road Safety Authority, the allocation of resources to the various programmes is a matter for the Authority itself.The level of fees for services provided through the Road Safety Authority is a matter for the Road Safety Authority in the first instance.

I understand from the NRA that it is currently in the process of drawing up its programme of works for 2009 based on its funding allocation for the year.  I cannot comment, therefore, on individual projects pending the outcome of that exercise.The provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.The adjustment in capital funding in 2009 will not have a significant effect on the roll out of the Transport 21 public transport programme and will not result in the postponement of the start of construction of any public transport project.I have also asked the implementing agencies to ensure that they continue planning work on Transport 21 projects so that a shelf of work is ready to start as resources become available.The start and completion dates of national roads and public transport projects, which have not yet commenced, will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. The commencement dates for these projects will also be influenced by the time taken for public consultation, the relevant statutory process and the procurement and contract award processes.

In recent months all buses in the Dublin Bus fleet have been fitted with smart card validators. Smart cards are now in use on these buses in respect of a number of ticket products such as annual and monthly bus tickets, annual and monthly integrated bus and rail tickets and 5-day rambler tickets.From late next year, a single smart card will be introduced for ticket products on Dublin Bus and Luas services. This smart card will also have an electronic purse capability for use on both services.This system will then be extended to Irish Rail DART and commuter rail services within a further 12 months, and Bus Éireann on a pilot basis on a number of its commuter routes. It is also envisaged that private bus operators will join the scheme over this timeframe.  The new gating systems at Irish Rail stations in the GDA have been designed to handle the new smart card.A total of €14.7 million has been paid out by the Exchequer on integrated ticketing since the inception of the project in 2002. This expenditure encompasses project management, design and development costs and operator contributions.The Project is being rolled out progressively in line with international experience. The Chairman of the Integrated Ticketing Project Board has told me good progress is being made and that, while there are significant issues to be resolved, all parties are working together to see the scheme delivered in line with project timescales.

The Group comprises the chief executives of the principal implementing agencies, an Assistant Secretary from my Department, the Fingal County Manager, the Director of Traffic and representatives of the Garda Síochána and business associations.Two sub-groups have been established and the business community is represented on both.The Contingency Planning Group is overseeing the preparation by Dublin City Council of a traffic management strategy for the Transport 21 construction phase, focused particularly on the city centre.  This strategy will take account of other construction activity by local authorities, public bodies and private developers.The Communications Group is preparing a co-ordinated communications strategy for the construction period of major Transport 21 projects, such as Metro North and the Interconnector.  The theme of this strategy will be "Dublin is open for business".In addition, Dublin City Council is holding focus meetings with the City Centre business community while the RPA continues to meet individual businesses and residents' organisations along the Metro North preferred alignment to inform them of its plans and seek to address issues of concern.  I understand that in early in 2009 a multi-agency joint strategy, including a public information and awareness campaign, will be rolled out.I hold regular quarterly meetings with the Transport 21 implementing agencies, An Garda Síochána and business organisations in Dublin to identify the principal concerns of the business community and to review progress on traffic planning for the construction phase of Transport 21 projects.  I last met with the Dublin City Centre Stakeholders Group on 29 September 2008.  It was agreed at that meeting that the next meeting of the Stakeholders Group will be in January 2009.

The Free Travel Scheme of the Department of Social and Family Affairs has been extended to the RTP.The bottom-up approach developed during the pilot Rural Transport Initiative (2002-2006) demonstrated that local people know best what transport services they need. My role, therefore, continues to be one of facilitator, helping local communities to address their transport needs through financial and administrative support, while communities themselves take the lead in clarifying their needs and developing co-ordinated transport services to fulfil those needs.I understand that the transport modes utilised by the individual RTP groups vary in accordance with the needs that they are trying to address and can include mini-buses, taxis and private cars. In the latter case, I am advised that RTP funded car schemes are operational in Counties Sligo and Leitrim and that such schemes are being contemplated elsewhere.The RTP is being expanded on a phased basis in consultation with individual RTP groups, with a goal of achieving nationwide coverage in due course in line with Government policy. It is planned that by end-2008, RTP groups will be operational in every county and will be working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas. A total of €11m is being provided for the programme in 2009.

A further round of consultation is now underway to provide greater definition to certain elements of the route after which the RPA will proceed with the preparation for a Railway Order application to An Bórd Pleanála during 2009.On the 10th of October 2008, the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) published the emerging preferred route corridor for the Luas line to Lucan (Line F) following extensive public consultation.   Having selected the route corridor, the RPA is now undertaking the next phase of consultation with key stakeholders which will feed into the detailed design of the line.   Following completion of this work the RPA will submit a Railway Order application to An Bord Pleanála in respect of this line.The start and completion dates of metro west and Luas Line F will be determined by the outcome of the statutory approval and procurement processes and the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.   The provision of increased capacity will be a key priority in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	952	Penalty points were first applied in October 2002 to the offence of speeding and have since been rolled out in stages between then and September 2006 in respect of a total of 36 offences.  The focus of the roll-out of the penalty points system to date has been on road safety critical offences that relate primarily to the behaviour of drivers. These include the offence of speeding, driving without insurance, non-wearing of safety belt, careless driving, holding a mobile phone while driving and a range of moving offences.The remaining scheduled offences to which the penalty point system may be applied relate primarily to offences relating to vehicles and their use, lighting of vehicles and the licensing of drivers.  Detection of breaches of these offences continue to be enforced by the Gardaí by means of summons to court.The progressive extension of the penalty point system will continue to be pursued.   There is an Action in the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 to expand the range of road safety related offences covered by way of penalty points and administrative fines.My Department is the lead agency on this Action (which has a completion date of end of Quarter 1 2009) with support from Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Garda Síochána, Courts Service and RSA.  Discussions are held with the support agencies regarding the timing of each scheduled roll-out of new offences to ensure that the relevant interfaces are in place between the Garda Síochána and the Court Services IT systems and the National Driving File.  The relevant support systems must be put in place to support the extension of the penalty points system, and where applicable, the fixed charge system.Discussions are not concluded on the operation and extension of the penalty point and fixed charge systems. These discussions will continue over the coming months, with the target date of end Quarter 1 2009 in mind, but it would premature to speculate as to how many of the remaining scheduled offences will be prioritised for penalty points at that time.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	953	The RPA continues to make good progress on the PPP tender process for Metro North.  The initial phase of the PPP public procurement process was conducted in 2007 resulting in the formation of four pre-qualified consortia for the purpose of tendering for the project. Tender documentation was formally issued to the four pre-qualified consortia on 12th May 2008.  Since then the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has held a number of meetings with the consortia. Following on from a request from some of the consortia, the RPA recently agreed to extend the closing date for submission of tenders by two months.  Receipt of tenders is now required by 6 February 2009.In addition, good progress is being made in the planning process.  The RPA placed copies of the Railway Order application on display on 17 September in accordance with the 6 week statutory public notice requirement pursuant to section 37 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001.In January 2008, the Government approved the funding structure for the Metro North PPP, including an Exchequer provision for advance works ahead of the main PPP contract and a capital contribution during construction.  In accordance with the requirements of the Government decision on the Transport 21 Investment Framework, Metro North will be submitted to Government for a final decision on the project on the completion of the tender process.I am not in a position to give any information in relation to the budget for Metro North project in advance of the completion of the public procurement process.  The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement process would prejudice the State's capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of the project.

This Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States.  It sets down common European rules in relation to licensing of air carriers, access to intra-community air routes and transparency of air fares.Under the Regulation airlines can freely set their fares but specific requirements are set down in relation to the manner in which information on air fares is published.   Article 23 of the Regulation stipulates, inter alia, that air fares (for air services from an airport located in a Member State) available to the general public, shall at all times indicate the final price to be paid.  On 31 October, I made Statutory Instrument No. 426 of 2008, to give effect to Regulation (EC) No. 1008/2008 and to lay down penalties for non-compliance with Article 23 of the Regulation.As I indicated to the House in early October (Dáil Question No. 58 of 1st October 2008) myself and my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment agreed in principle that the National Consumer Agency should be assigned responsibility for enforcing the new European rules on transparency of pricing information on air fares set down in the Regulation.  My officials and officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are currently discussing the transfer or assignment of enforcement powers in this regard to the NCA.

The capital allocation for public transport in 2009, at €916.5 million, is considerably higher than the funding made available to the sector prior to the current year. In 2007, the capital allocation for public transport was €724 million while in 2006, it was €492 million.The adjustment in the capital allocation for public transport in 2009 will necessitate a review of the priorities in the Transport 21 investment programme.  The provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.  All of the public transport projects currently under construction will continue on schedule and some, such as the Cork — Midleton line, Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor and the Luas extension to the Docklands, will be completed in the course of the year.The adjustment in capital funding for public transport investment will not have a significant effect on the roll out of the Transport 21 public transport programme and will not result in the postponement of the start of construction of any public transport project next year.  The start and completion dates of public transport projects, which have not yet commenced, will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. The commencement dates for these projects will also be influenced by the time taken for public consultation, the relevant statutory process and the procurement and contract award processes.The other area of major capital expenditure in my Department is on roads.  My priorities in this area are the completion of the major interurban network by 2010 and the progressive development of the Atlantic Road Corridor. I understand from the NRA that it is currently in the process of drawing up its programme of works for 2009 based on its funding allocation for the year.  I cannot comment, therefore, on individual projects pending the completion of that exercise.

Luas line BX runs from St. Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street while Luas line D is the onward extension of the line from O'Connell Street to Liffey Junction.  Earlier this year, I mandated the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) to proceed with planning the delivery of line BX/D, based on the agency's preferred route for line BX and the use of the old Broadstone railway alignment for line D.  It will not be possible to fully construct Luas line BX at the same time as the construction of Metro North because of the traffic management implications which would arise in the city centre.  The RPA is developing a construction strategy for Luas line BX, in close co-operation with Dublin City Council, which includes use of Metro North construction sites and recognises the traffic management requirements of the city centre.  The RPA is engaging with Dublin City Council on the basis of the contemporaneous delivery of lines BX and D.  In this regard it is the intention of the RPA to make a single railway order application for the combined line BX/D to An Bord Pleanála in the latter part of next year.  I understand from the RPA that public consultation on line D route options is taking place at present and that the identification of a preferred route option is likely by the end of 2008.Transport 21 provides that new Luas lines will link into the existing network to provide a coherent public transport offering and operational flexibility to the travelling public, enabling depot and other resource sharing between lines with consequent efficiencies.  I am of the view, for the reasons outlined above, that the construction of Luas line D, without proceeding with line BX, would not be a viable option for operational and transport planning reasons.  The start and completion dates of Luas line BX/D, will be determined by the outcome of work being undertaken by Dublin City Council and the RPA in developing a construction strategy, the outcome of the statutory approval and procurement processes and the funding allocation available to my Department during the current difficult economic climate.

I understand that the content of the report will form the basis for guidelines that will issue from the Department of Finance. The agencies under my Department with responsibility for implementing capital projects will be required to take these guidelines into account for future projects.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	961	I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 165 together.The Cork Swansea Ferry Company suspended its service in 2007.  I can appreciate the concerns that have been expressed in the region in response to this development. The Port of Cork Company is continuing to engage in discussions with a number of interested parties and stakeholders with a view to the latter commencing a new passenger and freight service on the Cork-Swansea route. The Port of Cork Company also completed a feasibility study on the route and this indicated that a service, subject to procuring a suitable vessel, could be feasible for an operator for year round passenger and freight operations. The Port of Cork Company will continue to do what it can to facilitate the resumption of the service.As Minister of State for Transport, I feel it is important that the market offers a diverse range of maritime links in and out of the State. This is vital to facilitate trade and tourism. I certainly hope that the current efforts show that the service is commercially viable and that it can be resumed as soon as possible. It is not the practice to subsidise international shipping routes, nor are there any funds available to my Department for this purpose. However, there are two European Commission programmes that encourage development of transnational shipping routes with the objective of shifting freight from the roads network; they are the Motorways of the Sea and Marco Polo programmes. These programmes are run by the European Commission and are guided by a specific set of rules and framework. The Irish Maritime Development Office regularly publishes full details of these programmes on its website (www.imdo.ie).

The conduct of industrial relations is a matter for the company and the State's shareholding does not confer on me any direct role in this matter.Under Company law all directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the Company. Subject to that duty, the State's nominees on the Board of Aer Lingus have been issued with a mandate to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at Board level. The mandate specifically states that the possible decisions concerned would include decisions on proposals with significant local or national economic implications including a direct impact on employment. In accordance with the mandate the State's nominees are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives. However, the Deputy will be aware that directors are not at liberty to disclose price sensitive information to shareholders. The mandate to the State-nominated directors is subject to the overriding obligations of all directors to uphold their fiduciary duties and protect the interests of all shareholders.As Minister for Transport I am concerned that any disruption of services arising from possible industrial action would inconvenience the travelling public and have a negative effect on the economy which is already experiencing serious difficulties. I would therefore urge all sides to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms of the State to provide any necessary assistance in resolving current challenges faced by the management and employees of the Company.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	965	I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 206 and 207 together.Ireland's aviation policy as set out my Department's current Statement of Strategy is to promote regular, safe cost effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets. To this end, within the European Union, Ireland has consistently supported market liberalisation measures, which have to date, served as the platform for the rapid expansion of aviation generally. We have also sought to influence the emerging EU and wider international framework for aviation to ensure that it continues to promote competition and innovation in the market-place. The introduction the EU-US Open Skies agreement and the conclusion of a more liberal agreement on a bilateral basis with Canada illustrates our commitment to supporting liberalisation measures.Our approach to the encouragement of air services is complemented by our policy on the development of airport infrastructure within the country. The main objective is to ensure that the three State Airports have sufficient capacity to respond to the growth opportunities of a competitive airline sector and to provide vital international access. The opening of Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport in early 2010 will allow Dublin Airport to comfortably handle up to 35 million passengers per year and will create a vibrant modern airport that will be an efficient gateway to the Ireland of the 21st century. In addition the six regional airports have a role to play in facilitating access to the regions. My Department provides necessary financial support for airport development and operations as well as PSO services connecting Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo, Donegal and Derry to Dublin.The further key components of our strategy are to ensure that our aviation safety and security policies comply with, or exceed, the highest international standards and that the policy framework for air navigation services ensures that the requirements of airlines for efficient routings and the avoidance of delays are met as far as possible without compromising safety. On the question of costs associated with air travel, because of the market position of Dublin airport, charges at Dublin airport are subject to independent regulation by the Commission for Aviation Regulation with a view to ensuring that charges are maintained at competitive levels. While other airports are not subject to regulation, in setting charges all airports have to take account of the highly competitive nature of the aviation market in order to attract and retain airline services.From an Irish economy perspective, the overarching priority is to maintain the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets around the world and my Department will continue to closely monitor developments in the aviation sector that impact on that objective. While sustained high fuel costs continue to have a very negative impact on airlines, even if prices have fallen back from all-time peaks, I do not believe that a review of our strategy for aviation is warranted at this time.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	967	The changed economic climate has inevitably impacted on the volume of trade through the State's ports. In September the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) published its mid-year analysis of traffic volumes through the ports. This showed that throughput fell during the first half of 2008. The IMDO's analysis shows that roll-on/roll off (ro-ro) volumes were down 4%, lift-on/lift off (lo-lo) volumes were down 3% and bulk volumes were down 8% when compared to the same six months in 2007. On a more positive note, the analysis also shows that the traffic data for the 2nd quarter this year indicates no further fall in export volumes for this period.Notwithstanding the changed economic circumstances, the provision of additional modern port capacity is still required in the medium term. Once the economy returns to growth, it will be important that the transport infrastructure is in place to facilitate this upturn. The Transport Programme of the NDP 2007-2013 contains a Ports Sub-Programme. The NDP estimates that the port infrastructure projects that may be completed in the lifetime of the current NDP will cost between €300 and €600 million. This expenditure will not be Exchequer funded, but will be funded from a combination of the internal resources of the port companies, private sector investment and other sources of commercial financing.

I understand from the NRA that the estimated final outturn cost of the Tunnel remains at €751 million.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	970	The Primary purpose and aim of the Road Safety Action Plan is to save lives and reduce injuries on our Roads, by reducing fatalities to no more than 60 fatalities per million or 252 fatalities per year.The 1 Primary Action of saving lives is supplemented by 125 other specific actions, designed to bring about the objective expressed in the primary action.The Strategy is being successfully implemented. Thankfully, we have seen a marked reduction in the number of people killed on our roads in 2007 and to date this year, despite the fact there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of drivers and a 70 per cent increase in the number of vehicles on our roads.According to the European Road Safety Performance Index (PIN) programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, (ETSC), Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance.Action 83 of the Strategy is for the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to report to me each year on the implementation of the 126 actions in the Strategy, all of which identify the lead agency responsible for implementation and a target implementation date.Both Minister Dempsey and I have received that report and the Authority has confirmed that all actions in the Strategy identified for completion in 2007 have been completed in full.These include publication of a revised Rules of the Road, road safety awareness events, integration of RSA enforcement activity with An Garda Síochána and Customs and publication of various consultation documents including one on compulsory training for motor cyclists.In the coming weeks Minister Dempsey and I will bring that report to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Road Safety which Minister Dempsey chairs. I envisage that the report will then be publicly available.It is of course the case that work has already begun on other actions in the Strategy which have a longer timeframe for completion, for example the introduction of a lower blood alcohol level for drivers (Action no. 76), with target date of 2nd Quarter 2009, which will form part of the Road Traffic and Transport Bill, which I hope to see published early next year.Provisions relating to mandatory alcohol testing of drivers at collisions (Action no. 75) will also be included in that Bill.

At this stage verification of data relating to only one insurer remains to be finalised and when this is completed shortly the Department will write to the owners affected. This will bring this whole exercise to conclusion.As I indicated in responses to previous similar questions, voluntary arrangements with insurers have been put in place whereby the NVDF receives regular notifications of write off instances. These arrangements which are operating well are enabling the NVDF to have current write off data and I am disposed to having a period of evaluation of these voluntary arrangements before considering what, if any, compulsory obligations are warranted.Provision of write-off data in relation to vehicles at the time of registration is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	975	The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997 obliges those selling petrol and diesel products to exhibit notices at their premises of the retail price per litre being charged for those products. The purpose of the Order is to allow consumers to inform themselves of the prices being charged by particular fuel retailers in their locality so that they can make informed choices as to how to get the best value for money. Evidence available to the National Consumer Agency, particularly in the grocery area, shows that consumers by being strategic in relation to where they purchase goods can act as a catalyst for greater competition particularly in the area of prices.In so far as the Deputy's suggestion is concerned, I am not altogether convinced that it would be practical to extend the scope of the display orders to oblige fuel retailers to notify the National Consumer Agency of the prices they charge for petrol and diesel products and of any changes to those prices. I do, however, accept that there is need for greater transparency between the manner in which the retail price for fuel paid by consumers follows changes in the wholesale price.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that in September I requested the National Consumer Agency to undertake a survey into why pump prices for petrol and diesel have not fallen in line with the drop in the wholesale price of oil.  I am advised by the Agency that work in relation to this matter is well underway.  I understand that as part of its work, the Agency will seek to benchmark movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries and that it will also seek to examine the frequency and the timeliness in which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers.  I look forward to receiving the Agency's report into this matter and to considering any suggestions in relation to improving the transparency of the relationship between the wholesale and retail prices of fuel products.

In the circumstances the provision of a taxi or other transport service to and from work, irrespective of the personal circumstances of an individual employee, is a benefit which would result in a charge to benefit-in-kind being imposed.However, in circumstances where an employer provides a monthly or annual bus, railway or ferry travel pass issued by an approved transport provider such a benefit is specifically exempted from a charge.The existing legislation is considered satisfactory and there are no plans at this time to revise the legislation.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	979	There are two categories of charges applied by the banks; interest-related banking charges and non-interest-related banking charges and fees.Interest-related banking charges are determined by the banks themselves on the basis of market considerations and neither the Minister for Finance nor the Financial Regulator have any statutory role in this matter.  In setting the level of such charges for a borrower, a bank would have regard to a variety of factors such as the customer's credit history, the risk perceived to attach to the loan, the cost of funds to the bank, competition considerations etc.The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 provides the framework for granting a guarantee to the participating banks. It does not, however, provide for State assistance or participation in the banks.  Accordingly, as Minister for Finance, I do not have a right to interfere in the commercial decision making of the banks.As the Deputy will be aware, in welcoming the European Central Bank's announcement on 6 November 2008 of a 0.5% reduction in its key interest rates, I highlighted that I would expect financial institutions to pass on these reductions to their customers, in particular to those purchasing properties on variable mortgages and to small and medium-sized enterprises.  This will help support sustainable growth and employment along with the maintenance of price stability in line with the ECB's objectives.The regulation of non-interest-related banking charges/fees is vested in the Financial Regulator and credit institutions are obliged to seek the prior approval of the Regulator before any increase in such fees.  In fact, Ireland is the only EU country with statutory control on such fee increases.  If the increased charge to which the Deputy is referring falls within this category, it will, as I have indicated, have received the prior approval of the Financial Regulator.

The block was introduced to limit revenue loss and tax avoidance.  The cost to the Exchequer of removing this block would be significant.In addition, removing the block on leasing while maintaining a block on the purchasing of business cars would not be feasible as it would introduce distortion of competition whereby leasing companies would enjoy a significant advantage over companies selling cars to the business community.  Concerns also arise in controlling the measure given the potential for abuse.

The Report is being examined in my Department and I will be responding to the Committee in due course in the prescribed manner.  By way of general comment I can say that not all the recommendations require legislative change and some are already being advanced administratively.Regarding the specific recommendation that access to the entire database of landlords' PPSNs held by the PRTB (Private Residential Tenancies Board) would enhance Revenue's compliance work, I can advise the Deputy that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has asked my Department to consider including the necessary legal provisions in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  However, following discussions between my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the PRTB, it was decided that access to the PRTB Register would be provided for by legislation in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is to be brought forward by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

As and from 30th September it withdrew this facility.I would like to emphasise that I support choice for women in childbirth.  However, the option of domiciliary births must only be provided in a safe and secure manner.  This was the key finding of the Expert Group on Domiciliary Births which reported in 2004.  The Health Service Executive established a National Implementation Committee, representative of all the stakeholders involved, to implement the recommendations of the report.  Following extensive consultations, agreement has been reached for the extension of the HSE's cover, under the State's Clinical Indemnity Scheme, to include the 15 self-employed community midwives.  This includes those practising in the HSE West region and is subject to the signing by the individual midwife of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Health Service Executive.  The MOU is constructed on the basis of appropriate forms of governance, clinical supervision, clinical care pathway, performance management and audit frameworks being in place to ensure a safe system for home births.The new arrangements provide a robust national clinical governance framework which ensures that self-employed community midwives work closely with the HSE, the HSE maternity services and voluntary maternity hospitals.

The primary purpose of this measure is to prevent the use of price as a sales promotional device by setting price levels below which brands may not be sold.Cigarette pricing controls are part of a long-running and sustained effort to decrease smoking prevalence.  Evidence shows that pricing is a key tool in this regard and, in particular, in preventing children and adolescents from taking up the habit.  Cigarette prices in Ireland are currently the second highest in Europe and the highest in the EU.

Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke's Hospital Dublin or University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement is also in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to BCH.In April this year, Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&PS), Northern Ireland announced the provision of a satellite centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin.  It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland and recognises the potential for cross border co-operation in the development of this resource.  Officials from my Department and the DHSS&PS continue to hold discussions in this regard.  DHSS&PS expect that this facility will be operational by 2015.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	997	I am aware of the recently published report by Dublin Inner City Partnership regarding the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which was introduced by my Office in January 2008.  I understand that officials in my Office were in contact with and provided information to the Partnership at the time of its drafting.  While there are no plans to review the scheme at this point, in order to support the sustainability of the sector, I think it is important to provide a number of clarifications in regard to the purpose of the CCSS funding.As I have said, the CCSS was introduced in January of this year, replacing a previous support scheme for community-based childcare services, both of which support community-based services to enable them provide reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.  As childcare services which in many cases are in receipt of substantial levels of State funding, they are expected to operate on a sound financial footing, balancing their expenditure with income.  The support funding enables the services to assist disadvantaged and low income parents and is not provided in respect of parents outside of these categories.  Therefore to be sustainable, services must charge non-qualifying parents the full cost fee which, in almost all cases, will still be substantially less than that payable by their counterparts in non-supported services.As I have outlined, the CCSS is a clearly defined support scheme for community-based childcare services which are required to operate as sustainable entities, alongside other childcare providers.  This approach provides equity as well as efficiency in both the broader childcare sector and amongst community services.  For example, a community service operating in an area where there are few qualifying parents, and for which capital funding was provided to ensure childcare provision, will generate the bulk of its operational costs from fee income.  At the same time, a community service operating in a highly disadvantaged area would, in the absence of the support scheme, be unable to generate sufficient fee income to maintain its service.

The thresholds are €700 (gross) per week for a single person and €1400 (gross) per week for a couple.  It is expected that 95% of those aged 70 or over (about 330,000 out of 353,000) will get a medical card under the new arrangements announced by the Government.Over 1.3 million people in the State currently have a medical card.  The objective of the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme is to ensure that the medical card benefit is available to those who are unable without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for themselves and their dependants.  I am satisfied that the Government decision to remove the automatic eligibility to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over with effect from 1st January 2009 is an effective measure to ensure that public health funding is used to help those most in need.

No construction activity is proposed during 2009. The precise allocation for the projects will be determined in the coming weeks taking account of the out-turn of expenditure in 2008 and this remains the position.However, I can tell the Deputy that the provision will be sufficient to allow work to continue on both projects and that Iarnród Éireann and the RPA plan to be in a position to submit applications for Railway Orders for both projects by the end of 2009. In relation to tenders, I understand that the preparation of the tender documentation will be ongoing during the Railway Order process. However, at this stage it is too early to determine a date when final tenders for construction will be sought.As I have stated previously, the start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects which have not yet commenced will be determined by the outcome of the statutory processes and the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.  The provision of increased capacity will be a key priority in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.

Therefore, while I accept that a reduced budget will cause some difficulties, I also consider that there is sufficient funding provided in 2009 for the Human Rights Commission to enable them to adequately discharge their core activities.I would reiterate that, as I indicated in my contribution to the budget debate, I had decided that the main priority in the Justice area in 2009 will be tackling crime. In that regard, decisions about funding reflect that priority with the result that in a small number of areas budgets have been reduced significantly. Moreover, in line with Government policies generally I have asked all State bodies to significantly reduce their spending on consultants, advertising and other non core items.

However, this process can prove difficult for the victim to obtain financial redress. This is in large part the reason that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme now exists.  The Compensation Tribunal is in a position to provide compensation to victims of crime and has a budget of €4.6 million in 2008.The Programme for Government contains a number of commitments in respect of victims.  I will be pursuing their implementation, following further study, during the course of my term in office.It is important to note that this work is taking place against the backdrop of a range of significant complementary measures introduced by me such as the recent establishment of the Victims of Crime Office to improve State and Voluntary Sector Services for the victims of crime.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  Applicants must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.The Act further provides that the court may require an applicant to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  My Department is committed to ensuring that public funds are safeguarded and, in consultation with the Courts Service, is currently reviewing the operation of this aspect of criminal legal aid.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1011	The Government's commitment to tackling domestic violence is reflected in the establishment in June, 2007 of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. Cosc's key responsibility is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Its major priority is to produce a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which has the support of State and Non-governmental Organisations in the sector.  This strategy will set out the policy on addressing the forms of violence concerned as well as the preventative and responsive actions to be taken by a broad range of organisations to ensure a well co-ordinated system is in place. Work on preparing the strategy is well advanced.  There was a good response to a call for submissions earlier in the year and a round of regional consultations with Non-governmental Organisations is due to commence in coming weeks. Cosc has also commenced a research project to map the relevant services currently available in Ireland for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and this work will also inform the strategy.  The commitments in the Programme for Government to establish a Domestic Violence Prevention Office and a Domestic Violence Fund are being addressed in the context of work on the national strategy.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1012	I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 217, inclusive, and 221 and 222 together.The arrangements for the monitoring and supervision of sex offenders is provided for in the Sex Offenders Act 2001.A person found convicted of a sexual offence must, pursuant to Part 2 of the 2001 Act, notify the Garda Síochána of their name and address.  Arrangements are in place under which a Garda Inspector in each Division is designated with responsibility for the monitoring of such sex offenders and these arrangements are coordinated at a national level by the Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Investigation Unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.In addition the sentencing court in a specific case may impose a post-release supervision order pursuant to Part 5 of the of the 2001 Act.  Part 5 sets out a system for the post-release supervision of sex offenders. The sentencing court is obliged to consider whether to impose a sentence involving post-release supervision of the offender. In making this determination, the court must consider a number of factors including the offender's need for rehabilitation, the need to protect the public from serious harm and the prevention of commission of further offences. The court may call evidence in respect of each of the factors to be considered.  The post release supervision may be made subject to conditions that the offender attend specified "psychological counselling or other appropriate treatment".  The responsibility for the supervision is assigned to the Probation Service.I wish to advise the Deputy that  a High Level Group in my Department, involving the Garda Síochána, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service, has been examining  the current arrangements in place for the management of sex offenders and  what changes might be needed to enhance public protection and safety.  Their remit includes a review of the procedures and legislation relating to the assessment, monitoring and supervision of convicted sex offenders.  I expect that Group to submit a report to me on the matter early in 2009.I can further advise the Deputy that Work on the scheme of a Sexual Offences Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  The Bill will provide greater protection to children and other vulnerable persons against sexual abuse and exploitation. As the Deputy is aware, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment has been examining the Twenty Eight Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2007 and expects to report to the Oireachtas shortly.  This deals, inter alia, with important matters that arose from the Supreme Court decision in the C.C. case and it is likely that further legislation will be necessary to give effect to the Committee's recommendations.  As soon as these two pieces of legislation are enacted, there will exist a modern set of criminal laws governing sexual offences.  It is only at that point that the question of consolidation will arise.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	The Programme for Government 2007- 2012 contains a commitment to create a new offence of supplying and administering ‘date rape' drugs.  This is an issue which I regard with the utmost seriousness and it is therefore currently being given very careful consideration in my Department in the context of existing provisions in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  Section 12 of that Act already makes it an offence for a person to intentionally or recklessly administer to, or cause another to take, a substance which he or she knows to be capable of interfering substantially with the other person's bodily functions and where he or she knows the person does not consent to what is being done.  Section 12(2) provides that a substance capable of inducing unconsciousness or sleep is capable of interfering substantially with bodily functions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1014	The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is fully operational since 7 June, 2008. The Act provides for offences of trafficking in children and adults for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs. It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose. Penalties of up to life imprisonment and a fine apply in respect of these offences. The Act amends the definition of ‘child' in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998 to mean a person under 18 years of age.Under Section 5 of the Act it is an offence for a person to solicit sexual services from a trafficked person where the person soliciting knows that the person has been trafficked. The soliciting can take place anywhere — in public or in private. Any person who accept or agrees to accept a payment, right, interest or other benefit for the prostitution of the trafficked person will also commit an offence. Fines of up to €5000 and 12 months imprisonment apply on summary conviction and an unlimited fine and up to 5 years imprisonment applies if a person is convicted on indictment.The State automatically accepts jurisdiction when the offence is committed in the State, including on ships or aircraft registered in the State. The Act also provides that if an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident in Ireland is alleged to have committed a trafficking offence abroad the State will accept the jurisdiction to try the offence here. Again, penalties of up to life imprisonment apply.Section 10, 11 and 12 provide protective measures for alleged victims. Under Section 10 the Judge may decide to exclude all persons other than officers of the court or persons directly concerned with the proceedings from the court — but announce the verdict, decision and the sentence (if any) in public. This ensures a lack of publicity surrounding these cases. It is also intended to protect trafficked persons who can be very vulnerable and traumatised and the traffickers and their criminal associates may wish to harm them or prevent them from giving evidence. It is an offence under Section 11 — with a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine — to publish or broadcast any information which could identify the alleged victim of the offence. Provision is also made — in Section 12 — to allow an alleged victim of trafficking to give evidence through a live television link, with the leave of the Court in the case of adults, from either within the state or abroad.As the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 only came into operation on 7 June 2008 no convictions have been recorded to date for offences contrary to that Act. However, prior to the enactment of the Act of 2008 the Garda Síochána utilised the provisions of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 in cases where human trafficking was suspected.  Since September, 2000 over one hundred persons have been arrested and detained in respect of alleged breaches of the provisions of Section 2 of the Act of 2000.  Four persons have been convicted in respect of twenty two alleged breaches of the provisions of Section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 and one person is currently awaiting trial while investigation files are being prepared for submission to the Law Officers.An administrative framework was introduced on 7 June providing for recovery and reflection periods and periods of temporary residence pending the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. The framework provides provide for a period of recovery and reflection of 45 days in the State for alleged victims of trafficking. In circumstances where the person wishes to assist the Garda Síochána in any investigation or prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking, a further six months period of residence, renewable, is provided to enable him or her to do so.An Anti-Human Trafficking unit was established in my Department in February 2008. A key element of the unit's work is the development of a National Action Plan to prevent and tackle trafficking in human beings. The plan will be approved by an Interdepartmental High Level Group for submission to me. It is being developed under the headings of prevention, prosecution of traffickers, protection of victims and child trafficking. Measures of assistance such as accommodation, access to emergency medical treatment, translation and interpretation, counselling and integration or safe return are being examined in conjunction with Governmental and non-governmental organisations at present and will also be examined in the context of the National Action Plan and the work of the High Level Group.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1015	As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, both of which are amended by the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005, provide for the recovery and disposal of the proceeds of crime. The provisions of this wide-reaching legislation cover confiscation, restraint of use, freezing, preservation or seizure of assets identified as deriving, or suspected to derive directly or indirectly, from criminal activity.The need to provide for additional legislative measures, including the issue of forfeiture of material gains in respect of the production, sale and distribution of illegal pornography is under review, in the context of other legislative priorities and in the light of commitments in the Programme for Government 2007-2012.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1016	The Deputy's Question is understood to refer to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime.Many of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime have already been given effect through legislation. Some additional legislation and administrative procedures will be required before ratification of the Convention can take place. This work is in train.The enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into effect on 7 June 2008 brought Ireland into compliance with the criminal law/law enforcement elements of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Other aspects of the Protocol are being dealt with administratively in the context of preparation of a National Action Plan and through engagement with the Governmental and non-governmental organisations in this area. It is expected that the Protocol will be ratified next year.

Having failed to receive a response a follow-up letter was forwarded to the applicant's solicitor on the 13th October 2008. To date, no reply to either of the letters has been received.

I would urge the persons referred to by the Deputy to contact An Garda Síochána concerning the problems they are experiencing, if they have not already done so.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1019	I have been advised by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) that the number of applications received by them to join the Garda Reserve is as follows.At September 2006, 6,661 applications had been received following an initial recruitment campaign.  At the end of December 2007, an exercise carried out by PAS showed that a total of 7,916 applications had been received up to that date.  In the first ten months of this year, there have been a further 3,729 applications.  360 people have graduated as Garda Reserve members since its establishment.  29 of those have since left the Garda Reserve.  The majority (20) have gone on to join the full-time force while 9 have left for personal reasons.In 2007 expenditure from the Garda Reserve subhead in the Garda Vote amounted to €45,000. The provision in this subhead for 2008 is €1.28 million and expenditure to the end of October amounts to €229,000. The estimates for 2009 provide €1.28 million for this subhead.   There are also costs which are not separately assigned to the Garda Reserve. These include the salary costs of Garda trainers as training Reserve members is considered part of the trainers' normal duties. In addition, uniforms for all Garda members are procured in bulk and as such, the specific cost of uniforms for the Garda Reserve members is not identifiable.The information requested in relation to the number of hours duty that have been logged by members of the Garda Reserve since the inception of the Reserve is not readily available and could only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought.  However, Section 11(4) of the Garda Síochána (Reserve Members) Regulations 2006 states that ‘A Reserve member may not be required to serve more than 208 hours of duty in any 12 month period'.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1020	There are a range of reasons why not all applicants secure a place as Reserve trainees. Applicants must first of all meet the basic entry criteria relating to age and residence as set out in Section 4 of the Garda Síochána (Reserve Members) Regulations 2006.  They must also satisfy the criteria regarding occupations, for example members of the Defence Forces are precluded from joining.  It may not be clear when the initial application is made whether an applicant satisfies the criteria.All applicants are written to from time to time by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) advising them of when there will be interviews in their locality.  Membership of the Reserve is a spare-time voluntary service.  Therefore, a significant number of applicants may not always be available to attend for interview or take up a place in training when it is first offered due to family, work or social commitments.The recruitment process involves a number of stages at which applicants must succeed before proceeding to the next stage.  The PAS carries out the interview and written test stage.  At the outset of the process, a number of applicants scheduled by PAS to attend for interview and written test generally fail to attend.  In 2008, approximately 80% of those who were scheduled to attend for interview actually attended.  Success at both interview and written test is required to proceed to the next stages of the recruitment process.  Of those that did attend approximately 65% were successful.If successful at the Public Appointments Service stage, applicants must then pass a Garda medical examination and must satisfy the requirements of a rigorous background security vetting.  In a sample of cases in 2008, approximately 50% of those that were successful at the PAS stage of the process passed the medical and security vetting stage of the process.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	Since its establishment in August 2006, the number of attested Garda Reserve members has risen steadily from 36 at the end of 2006 to 217 at the end of 2007 and a current number of 331.  There are also currently 76 Garda Reserve trainees. There have been occasional slight fluctuations over the past two years as some members have decided to discontinue their membership for a variety of reasons.  The majority have left to become full-time members of the force while a small number have left for personal reasons. I am confident that the Garda Reserve is on a sound footing and will continue to flourish with numbers growing steadily over time until the full complement of members is reached.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1022	A total of €258,868 has been incurred by the Garda Síochána Vote in 2007 (€154,736) and 2008 (€104,132) in respect of the public information campaigns to recruit for the Garda Reserve.  The Garda Reserve recruitment advertising campaign for 2009 is currently in the process of being planned and the estimated cost of that campaign is not currently available.In 2006, a major recruitment campaign was undertaken by An Garda Síochána with the purpose of recruiting to An Garda Síochána both full time and reserve Garda.  The total amount expended in 2006 on this campaign amounted to €683,933.  It is not possible to break this figure down into the amount spent in respect of the Garda Reserve only.

The programme is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that significant refurbishment work on the station referred to by the Deputy has been completed. It is anticipated that the remaining works, which are minor in nature, will be completed in December 2008 at which time the refurbishment works will be complete.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1025	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cumulative cost of the policing arrangements for the development referred to in Co. Mayo is approximately €11.1m.  This figure is made up of basic salary, overtime, subsistence allowance, travelling expenses and other ancillary costs.In accordance with section 7 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 An Garda Síochána is statutorily required to provide policing services for the State with the objective of, inter alia, preserving peace and good order, protecting life and property and preventing crime.  The policing operation in Co. Mayo meets these objectives.  The deployment of Garda resources is an operational matter for local Garda management based on an assessment of the situation pertaining locally and other policing requirements.  The costs incurred by the Gardaí relate to their function of preserving public order and no request has been made for the recoupment of such costs from the company.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1026	I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.I would refer the Deputy to my reply yesterday to Question No. 410 on developments on this issue.  As set out there, a second draft of a proposed Bilateral Agreement between Ireland and Belarus, to facilitate visits to Ireland by Chernobyl children, was conveyed to the Belarusian authorities on 26 October. I expect a response from the Belarusian authorities on this very shortly. Once this is received, my Department will move immediately to try to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. The Deputy can be assured of my ongoing personal commitment and engagement in that regard.

The Programme contributes to the costs of community and voluntary groups in providing a diverse range of community services, facilities and social enterprises to deliver critical local services and employment opportunities for particularly disadvantaged groups across the State.As of the end of October 2008, over 370 individual projects had been approved for funding at an estimated cost of some €48m this year.  At present the number of people employed by these projects is in excess of 2,390.   The project referred to by the Deputy has a contract with the Programme until the end of December 2009, with a funding commitment of €195,000 to employ one manager and seven full-time equivalent staff members.The provision in my Department's Vote for the Programme in 2009 (€50.850m) represents an increase on the projected outturn for the current year of just under €3m.  I am confident that this funding will be sufficient to meet the contracted costs of the projects within the Programme next year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	The back-to-work allowance scheme is part of the department's employment support programmes designed to assist and encourage the long term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force.  These allowances are designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments to make the return to work financially attractive and viable.There are two strands to the scheme, the back-to-work allowance (BTWA) for persons who take up employment and the back-to-work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for persons who become self-employed.  Participants receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a three year period for employees and a four year period for those who become self-employed.  Participants may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.To qualify for this allowance the application must be submitted in advance and the person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment for a specific length of time immediately prior to commencing employment.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance or benefit, the minimum period is two years.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme in order to target the scheme at the most disadvantaged.  People who have been unemployed for a very short time are not the main focus of the scheme.The Department will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the back-to-work scheme to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market.  However, I believe that the current provisions are adequate and I have no plans at present to modify the scheme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	The total expenditure on Child Benefit in 2006 was €2,056M, for 2007 the figure was €2,232m.The percentage of total Child Benefit expenditure paid to non national customers in respect of resident children is estimated at 13.5% in 2006 and 14% in 2007, this would equate to circa €277m in 2006 and €312m in 2007.The amount of Child Benefit paid to EU workers in respect of non resident children in 2006 was €2.9m and in 2007 it was €4.77m.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	Further to my response to PQ 39068/08 on 6 November 2008, I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the person concerned was notified on 2 September 2008 that her case was referred to an Appeals Officer and that it was proposed to hold an oral hearing in her case.  A time and date has not yet been arranged for her hearing, but every effort is being made to have it dealt with as quickly as possible.During 2007 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to 14.4 weeks.In 2008, to the end of September, the Social Welfare Appeals Office has received almost 14,000 appeals, an increase of 22% in respect of the same period in the last few years. Every effort is made to treat these appeals in a fair and equitable manner and within this context to have all appeals dealt with as quickly as possible. Improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  However, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on Social Welfare entitlements.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the White Paper on Defence.  The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training.  It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.  The consolidation process is designed to facilitate higher training standards, while also freeing up under-utilised resources and personnel for operational duties.The funding previously realised from the disposal of surplus barracks and properties has, together with pay savings, provided some of the resources required for infrastructure, training-area development and equipment procurement.  In this regard, the White Paper states:  "the thrust of the Government decisions in the White Paper is based on their recognition of the necessity to enhance the equipment and infrastructure available to the Defence Forces".The withdrawal of the British Army deployments coupled with reduced paramilitary activity following the Good Friday Agreement has removed the rationale for having seven barracks/posts along the border. These will now be consolidated into three posts.  Lifford and Rockhill Barracks is two of four military posts along the border being consolidated. These closures will progress the achievement of the vision of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper.This was not an easy decision and obviously the desire is to limit as far as possible the adverse impact that this relocation will have on personnel.  I appreciate that the consolidation proposals may result in a level of hardship on some personnel and I have asked my staff and the military authorities to take due consideration of personal circumstances.  That said, the current proposals are in the best interests of the Defence Forces and that must be my priority.The current plan has been put together in close consultation and cooperation with the Defence Forces General Staff.  It provides an overall package that will serve the needs of the Defence Forces into the future.

The Defence Forces pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Gardaí as required. The role does not extend to general policing which falls solely within the remit of An Garda Síochána.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 to 246, inclusive, together.The annual maintenance costs for Rockhill and Lifford army barracks amount to approximately € 130,000 for 2007. This covers maintenance to buildings such as general repairs, painting and decorating.  A further €160,000 approximately is spent on annual running costs such as gas, electricity, heating oil water and waste disposal.It is intended to relocate personnel from both Lifford and Rockhill to Finner Camp, Donegal.  It is envisaged that the extra annual running costs associated with accommodating these staff in Finner Camp will be marginal.While the closure of barracks and the sale of the properties have provided funding for investment in the past, it has never been the driving factor for the consolidation of defence infrastructure. The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the White Paper on Defence.The consolidation process is designed to facilitate higher training standards, while also freeing up under-utilised resources and personnel for operational duties. The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training. It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.As I have said in response to many questions in this House, Defence Forces properties are kept under constant review in terms of addressing Defence Force requirements and ensuring the most appropriate organisation of the Defence Forces taking account of the operational requirements. The development and increased capability of the modern Defence Forces when taken together with the improved security situation along the border has removed the rationale for having seven barracks/posts along the border and provided the opportunity for consolidation of units in a smaller number of locations. It should also be noted that the British Army has also closed most of its border posts already.The current plan has been put together in close consultation and cooperation with the Defence Forces General Staff. It provides an overall package that will serve the needs of the Defence Forces into the future.Expenditure on refurbishment and capital expenditure in tabular form is set as follows as requested.RockhillCostLiffordCost€€Replacement of Water Tanks27,860Painting To Administration Block19,270Dry / Wet  Rot Repairs193,340Forecourt Developement49,800Re-Roofing Privates Mess40,350Prefabricated Buildings15,120Resurfacing of Parade Ground66,660Upgrade of Kitchen to Dining Hall136,600Installation of Emergency Exit Doors88,400Resurfacing of Roads and Squares60,240Resurfacing of Roads and Squares73,250Window Replacement Mens Billet Accommodation22,280Refurbishment of Entrance Lobby to Dining Hall18,810Window Replacement Officers Mess19,460Reffurbishment of Dining Hall & Training Rooms129,330New Central Heating Boilers72,510Re-Roofing of Mens Dining Hall75,560New Waste Recycling Centre69,140New Piping to Fire Fighting System39,460Upgrade of 25 M Range68,290Painting of Entrance & Main Hall34,390Re-Roofing of Transport Workshops Block53,200

The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training.  It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.

In this regard, the White Paper states:  "the thrust of the Government decisions in the White Paper is based on their recognition of the necessity to enhance the equipment and infrastructure available to the Defence Forces".It is anticipated that Monaghan Army Barracks will be disposed of, taking account of market conditions, so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure  in accordance with Government policy.

A copy of the report can be downloaded from my Department's website at www.dcenr.gov.ie/natural.The SSC has recently provided the Department with provisional statistics on salmon stocks for 2008.  These details will be posted shortly on my Department's website as part of the public consultation process on the draft Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations for 2009.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1039	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services. In this regard my Department has undertaken to implement a National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.  It will bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.  It will also facilitate competition in the broadband market in the regions leading to greater choice, quality and value for money to the consumer.Two bids from eircom Ltd and Hutchison 3G Ireland have been received in response to the NBS Invitation to Tender.  These bids are currently being evaluated and the evaluation process is scheduled for completion shortly.  The contract is expected to be signed this month.It is important to note that in addition to fixed landline broadband, otherwise known as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or broadband over telephone lines, broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms including cable, satellite, fixed wireless and increasingly mobile.  I understand that Fanad already has broadband on offer from a number of service providers.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1040	The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on petroleum products in Ireland.  Retail prices reflect global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.The continued global volatility in oil prices is a cause for considerable concern for the Commission and EU Member States.  Speculation on the markets has been considered to be one factor that has played a role in amplifying price movements and increasing their volatility.  A number of strategies are being pursued at EU level to improve the understanding of oil markets and to enhance the transparency of the market.  Enhanced availability and quality of oil market data are critical to enhance market transparency and could help price volatility.  The Commission is developing proposals to require weekly reporting of commercial oil stocks in the EU.  The EU is also working to strengthen dialogue with key oil-producing countries.In terms of passing on of price reductions in world markets to consumers, it is the case that the prices Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.  The Euro/Dollar exchange rate is also a significant factor as oil is traded internationally in dollars.The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Responsibility for the National Consumer Agency (NCA) lies with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and she has recently requested the NCA to undertake a survey on retail prices of petrol and diesel.  I understand that the NCA will benchmark movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries and will examine the frequency and timeliness in which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers.The upward global trend in energy prices and the ongoing volatility generally reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and to use energy wisely and efficiently.  The Government is committed to accelerated delivery of our ambitious targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, which is essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and consumers.  My Department is working with other key Government Departments on initiatives to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in electricity, transport and heating, and to implement major energy efficiency and demand management programmes for both domestic and business consumers.

One of the phases relates to the proposed construction of a training wall.  The Marine Licence Vetting Committee, which advises my Department on scientific/environmental matters, has recommended an alternative approach to the construction of the training wall and this matter is being examined by my Department.However as the Port Company wishes to finalise a lease in respect of other aspects of the development, my Department, in conjunction with its specialist advisors, is progressing these aspects of the lease application separately. Every effort is being made to finalise this matter as soon as possible.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	In the aftermath of the EU ban in November 2000 on the feeding of MBM to cattle, the Exchequer supported the livestock and meat sector by subsidizing the rendering and destruction of the product (costing €146m between 2001 and 2003), as did most other EU countries. The costs of dealing with MBM have since largely been passed back to industry.The storage of MBM cost the State €25.3m in respect of material placed in store during 2001 and 2002. Storage costs were subsequently passed back to industry and are now a matter for commercial negotiation.Compilation of statistics by my Department on the production and disposal of meat and bone meal (MBM) commenced in 1999. The amount produced, the costs of disposal incurred in respect specifically of MBM stored on behalf of State and the payments made to the rendering industry under the Fallen Animals Scheme up to 2007 are as follows:MBM ProducedDisposal costs incurred by the StatePayments to rendering plants under the Fallen Animals Scheme’000s tonnes€m€1999149——2000137——2001166—1,192,53320021458.817,038,246200313817.715,706,183200413912.312,178,708200514311.713,398,41820061525.212,709,34420071500.213,643,824In the aftermath of the EU ban all MBM had to be stored or exported for disposal by incineration or co-incineration. There are now a number of additional outlets for this material. MBM is being used to make fertiliser, it is being used as an ingredient in petfood and also as a co-fuel in the cement industry. My Department is also aware of a number of proposals to use MBM as a fuel for generating electricity.The State has provided substantial funding towards the disposal of MBM over the past decade. This was justified as part of our response to the BSE crisis and as a means of protecting our valuable beef industry.  In view of our current budgetary constraints, the greatly reduced incidence of BSE, the imminent increase in the BSE testing age to 48 months and the increasing number of outlets for MBM it is now appropriate to reduce the level of State funding in this area. My officials are conducting ongoing discussions with representatives of the rendering industry, fallen animal collectors and farmers on this matter.

This meeting was exceptional in so far as the Independent Appeals Committee had concluded its work for the 2008/09 school year. It took this meeting with officials to prompt the school to act appropriately and the school provided assurances for the first time that it would address the core issue of how in future it would operate within its approved allocation.  This was the only school granted additional hours as an exceptional matter.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1050	I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.  What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.As I already stated, in terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1051	The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.  However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.  The position for individual schools will become clear at that stage.Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high concentrations of newcomer children.I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an intercultural Ireland.

The two categories of absences for which substitution cover will not be provided for in 2009 are uncertified sick leave at primary and second level and official school business at second level.  Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave.The supervision/ substitution scheme will also continue to operate for all schools with teachers continuing to be paid an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to salary for participation in the scheme.

The subject was first introduced into  Post-Primary schools in September 2007 and will be examined for the first time by the State Examinations Commission in June 2009.15 additional schools were invited to introduce the Leaving Certificate Technology syllabus in September 2008 as part of a phased implementation plan.  My Department has contacted the Principals of each of the additional schools to advise that in light of the competing demands on the available budget, it was not possible to approve funding at this time but that it is anticipated that the grant will be paid early in the new year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1055	Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education Budget for 2009, in making the announcement of the Budget measures for education, I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in these difficult times.  The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging. The decision made to suspend substitution cover for uncertified sick leave at primary and second level and official school business in second level schools was a difficult one.Substitution will continue to be provided for all other categories of absences currently available including maternity leave and certified sick leave.  The existing arrangements will continue to apply for the supervision/substitution scheme with teachers continuing to be paid an annual payment in addition to salary for participation in the scheme.As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of students. I am also requesting the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision/substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1056	Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on 5th June 2002, the Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme. This sum was broken down as follows:Property Transfers €76.86m;Cash Contribution €41.14m;Provision of Counselling Services €10m.In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions. This is because the Indemnity Agreement allows for cash to be substituted for property. The composition of the €128million has changed to the following:Property Transfers €66m;Cash Contribution €52m;Provision of Counselling Services €10m.I can confirm that the full cash contribution of €52m has been received, including that which was accepted in lieu of properties. My Department has also received confirmation that the contributing congregations have provided counselling services to the value of €10m.As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted, subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations. Valuations of the individual properties were fully agreed and fixed at 2002 values.  Consequently, the fact that the value of the properties may have fluctuated in the intervening period does not affect the value of the properties as determined by the Agreement.Furthermore, it should also be noted that the current market value of the properties is not critical from the State's point of view in that the vast majority have already been earmarked for specific purposes, for transfer to and use by various charitable organisations and state bodies.  The issue of current market value would only arise where the State intended to sell on a transferred property.  The value to the State in receiving the properties in question lies in their use by the recipients for various health, education and other social purposes.Given the complex and time consuming nature of property transfers, it is difficult to state with any degree of certainly when the entire portfolio of property will be fully and finally transferred to the State.  However, I am anxious to point out that whilst the legalities have not been finalised in all cases, with the exception of two, the properties are currently in use or are available for use by the transferee.  Currently, properties to the value of €26.79m have been fully transferred and a further €7.475m worth of properties have been handed over where legal arrangements are almost finalised. This leaves a balance of properties valued at €31.735 where the legal transfer remains to be completed. However, in the vast majority of the properties, good and marketable title has been fully established or the properties have been physically transferred to and are in possession of the State or 3rd Parties but there are some legal formalities to be finalised.  In a small number of cases, consideration may have to be given to accepting an alternative property or cash where good and marketable title cannot be established.Every effort will continue to be made by officials of my Department, through the State's legal representatives, together with the representatives of the congregations and recipient bodies, to ensure that all outstanding matters are finalised.

Mayo, Roll Number 12350T.My Department has received correspondence in relation to the partial surrender of a portion of the above school site for the establishment of a Playschool. This correspondence is currently under active consideration by officials in my Department. My officials will revert to the Solicitors in due course.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1059	It was recently announced that the Early Retirement Scheme for teachers, which had operated on a pilot basis since 1996, has been suspended in all sectors until further notice.  The Scheme, which consisted of 3 strands, was a voluntary scheme.  Like other programmes under my Department's remit, the continuance of the pilot scheme is subject to available resources and to changes in Government policy.  While the scheme has proven to be a useful management tool in the school system in the past, the current budgetary constraints mean that sometimes difficult decisions must be taken in order to meet the economic challenges faced by the country.Notwithstanding the suspension of the Early Retirement Scheme, other schemes of retirement before normal pension age remain available to teachers.  Teachers can avail of voluntary retirement at 55 years of age where a teacher has completed 35 years service or cost-neutral early retirement.Under the 55/35 year rule a teacher, other than a new entrant appointed after 1 April 2004, who has reached the age of 55 years and has at least 35 years of actual pensionable service, may retire voluntarily.  There is no actuarial reduction in benefits.  Where the teacher has less than 35 years actual service, credit for certain pre-service training is given in order to assist teachers to reach the 35-year threshold for retirement.  For example, a teacher, aged 55 years, who has undertaken 4 years pre-service training and has completed 33 years actual pensionable service, may retire.  Benefits would be paid with immediate effect in that instance and would be based on the actual pensionable service.  I understand that the person in question, who will reach age 55 in early 2009, had completed 4 years pre-service training.  Provided the person remains in pensionable service until the end of the 2008/09 school year, he will then fulfil the requirement for voluntary retirement under the 55/35 year rule as he will have in excess of 33 years reckonable service.Under cost-neutral early retirement, a teacher aged 50 years or over (55 years in the case of new entrants appointed after 1 April 2004) has the option of an immediate cost-neutral early retirement pension and lump sum on resignation.  The cost-neutral early retirement benefits are actuarially reduced to take account of the early payment of the lump sum and the longer period over which pension would be paid.  The person in question is free to apply now for cost-neutral early retirement.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.  The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.   In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education. In 2008 some €2 billion is being invested in our third level sector. In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development into the future, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for our higher education sector. It is appropriate to raise questions around how future additional resource needs can be met and in particular how our higher education institutions can be supported in their development ambitions through a widening of their non-exchequer sources of income. The introduction of a form of student contribution is one possibility that merits debate.  My Department is, at present, conducting a review of policy options relating to the introduction of a form of student contribution. It is my intention, following completion of the review currently underway, to bring proposals to Government in relation to the available options.

Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.The provision for funding to Vocational Educational Committees for 2009 shows an increase of more than 5% over the 2008 level. Funding to VECs for 2008 totalled €887.5m and this will rise to €936m in 2009.VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets.  This allows each VEC to distribute its allocations in line with their priorities and perceptions of need.The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2009 estimates, for this significant increase in the funding of VECs is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources in order to best address the needs of learners availing of services provided through the network of VECs.

My Department does not fund community facilities and I regret to say that it has not been found possible to identify an alternative source of funds that would enable the facilities to remain available for community usage on an ongoing basis. In the circumstances, my Department has written to the relevant stakeholders to advise them of the position.

However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
