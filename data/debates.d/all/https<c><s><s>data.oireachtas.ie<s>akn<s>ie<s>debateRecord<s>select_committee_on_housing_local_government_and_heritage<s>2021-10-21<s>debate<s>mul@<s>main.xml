          <p eId="para_70">Before I speak briefly to those amendments, I am still unclear about the legal status of the guidelines.

It would be helpful if the Minister of State clarified that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Either way, amendment No. 48 speaks to the need for full public consultation.

          <p eId="para_75">I am not clear from the legislation as to how far from real legislation the marine planning guidelines could go, but if we are basing an assessment on other planning legislation and guidelines for land use, we know that planning guidelines can be very far-reaching. The Minister can be far-reaching in what he can do within the guidelines. There are not sufficient limitations. Public consultation would be one measure to provide a check or balance, allowing public input into, and scrutiny over, what a Minister might do under these guidelines. I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> If we do not plan properly and if the Minister is drawing up and issuing guidelines without consulting people, consider the damage that could be done to our cetaceans. Ireland has 25 species of cetaceans, nearly one third of the total number of those species in the world. That is highly significant</p>
          <p eId="para_77">When it comes to climate change, as I am sure members are aware, one whale is worth the equivalent of thousands of trees in terms of carbon sequestration, as well as the carbon they take out of the atmosphere for hundreds of centuries. I mention this because if the Minister is drawing up and issuing guidelines, that could have far-reaching consequences on marine development and could have an impact on our cetaceans, on our biodiversity in the marine and on carbon sequestration in the marine from marine life. At a minimum, having public consultation as part of that process gives some level of a check and balance regarding Ministerial guidelines. I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that. </p>

          <p eId="para_78">A lot of questions have been asked. I refer to amendment No. 52 and to amendment No. 61 in particular, which also relates to directives. I note that we now have policy statements, guidelines and directives. Before all of that, we have plans. I am trying to understand the relationship between these different things and the precise hierarchy and relationship between them. It is fair to say that with all these different mechanisms for dictating by the Minister - because the Minister has the power to do these things - there seems to be a lot of power and many different avenues provided by the Minister to change things as they as move along. As we will see in the next grouping, there is a requirement to comply with these policy statements, guidelines, and directives, if I understand correctly. We have sought to delete line 35 in the subsequent group of amendments that we will deal with shortly. These mechanisms will be available to the Minister to direct and to give guidelines, that is, issue instructions and give the Minister a hell of a lot of power. One would worry about that sort of arbitrary power being given to the Minister. While we may have great confidence in the Minister of State sitting here in the room with us, who knows what sort of Minister we might have in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point is important as well. Rightly and understandably, there is a huge need to address the climate crisis but the biodiversity crisis is not mentioned as often. In fact, when one thinks about it deeply enough, a collapse in ecosystems could probably damage our ability to sustain our existence on this planet sooner than climate change. The collapse of whole ecosystems could have disastrous and unknown consequences, because everything is connected. We all depend on these interconnected chains called ecosystems. The marine, marine life and marine biology are all critical to our existence on this planet. There is a lot at stake, therefore. By requiring public consultation on all of these things, we are ensuring that it will not just be a hell of a lot of power concentrated in the hands of a single Minister but that everybody, including all stakeholders and society generally ,would have a voice in this. The Minister would have to meet many checks and balances in the objectives in developing the marine. </p>

        <speech by="#PeterBurke" eId="spk_13">

          <p eId="para_80">Amendment No. 48 proposes public consultation on any marine planning guidelines in line with the State's obligations under the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive and the Aarhus Convention. By their nature, such guidelines will require strategic environmental assessment. Integral to that process is public consultation. Guidelines prepared without that assessment and consultation would not survive judicial review. The term “full public consultation” is also technically problematic. It is not a defined term and contains an inherent risk that any consultation, no matter how comprehensive, could be challenged on the basis that it is not full or complete. Simply, direct and unspecific reference to the Aarhus Convention is not only unnecessary, it is legally problematic given the range of enabling legislation and European directives already in place giving effect to the principles set out therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> Amendment No. 52 proposes that public consultation is undertaken for the making, amending or revocation of any guidelines. This is an overly onerous and restrictive provision. It would oblige public consultation on the correction of even a single typographical error. Any amendment to the guidelines will be subject to SEA screening, and full SEA including public consultation, if required. There may also be a need to urgently amend any guidelines resulting from emergent case law, both domestic and European. Guidelines would normally be revoked where a new set of superseding guidelines are developed. It would not be practical or best use of resources to hold a separate consultation specifically on revocation. </p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Amendment No. 61 proposes public consultation on every directive or amendment or revocation. By their very nature, directives may be needed urgently to ensure the legally robust functioning of the marine planning system. Directives issued under this section will be subject to obligations under section 31 in respect of appropriate assessment, AA, and strategic environmental assessment, SEA. If such assessments are screened in, public consultation will be undertaken as a matter of course and existing obligation. I therefore oppose these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> There appears to be a misunderstanding of the purpose of these guidelines and policy directives. They are used to ensure that the system that is being designed here operates as intended. They will be drawn up and will operate within the policy framework, as set up in the national marine planning framework that has been approved by the Oireachtas. They are there to make it work. They are also there to show specific public bodies how they can comply with the policies and objectives of the national marine planning framework, maritime spatial plan, or designated marine area plans, DMAPS. Moreover, in some extreme cases, they can direct them to act in a certain way in order to comply with these policies or with emerging case law. They are created in a system that is designed around the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive, has also had regard to the marine strategy framework, MSF, directive and the principles established in the Aarhus Convention, as already transposed in Ireland. The SEA and AA-related directives already apply to them by reference to section 31 of the Bill. It is simply not necessary to restate these things in every Part of this Bill; it is unwieldy and would have a myriad of unintended consequences. In addition, there appears to be a perception that the Government is currently avoiding consultation with the public generally. That simply could not be further from the truth. Consultation and, more appropriately, participation occur in a variety of ways. To give the most recent example of guidelines that I published under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, namely, the draft development plan guidelines for planning authorities, these were placed on public display for the acceptance of submission from 13 August 2021 to 8 October 2021, a period of almost nine weeks. However, to get to that point, a high degree of consultation with various stakeholders was carried out. This was to ensure their operational effectiveness. Appropriate consultation does take place in respect of such guidance already. It will continue to do so under the provisions drafted, where appropriate. </p>

          <p eId="para_85">I thank the Minister of State for his answer. If there is some misunderstanding, confusion is probably a better word for it because the Bill itself is not clear. Certainly, it does not provide us with as clear an explanation as the Minister of State has just provided for us on the floor. That was helpful. The difficulty, however, with the reference to section 31 is that if an SEA screening is to take place and an SEA is not required, that means there would be no public consultation. It would only be in the context of a strategic environmental assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">That is a very different position from what has just been outlined with respect to the county development plan guidelines, whereby a robust consultation took place over a number of months. Was consideration given to public consultation even where a strategic environmental assessment screening did not require such an assessment?</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Will the Minister of State address the point raised by me and others on the mandatory nature of these? Are these similar to the section 28 mandatory ministerial guidelines on terrestrial planning or do they simply have to have regard to them in respect of functions? We will discuss that more specifically with the next set of amendments but I am trying to understand the full intention behind section 7.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2021-10-21T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_88">It is a misunderstanding to think these amendments are suggesting what the Minister of State has said they are. It was stated that these would mean a correction of a typo would require public consultation. That is a bit of a stretch and nobody would suggest that these amendments would mean that the correction of a typo would require public consultation. The general understanding is that any material changes would require public consultation but that a typo correction would not. The Minister of State might give some examples of where typo corrections require public consultation, seeing as that is his stated position on this. I do not accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> The Minister of State also indicated that there would need to be a separate consultation on the revoking of guidelines. At the same time, he states that the revoking of guidelines would nearly always happen in conjunction with new guidelines being introduced. It is quite clear that where new guidelines are being introduced and other guidelines are being revoked, there could be a consultation process on the revoking of guidelines and introduction of new guidelines if it is all part of the same process. Given that the Minister of State argues that it would be a rare scenario for guidelines to just be revoked on their own without new guidelines being introduced, the scenario about which he is worried - the revocation of guidelines requiring a separate consultation - would not frequently arise, if ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I have the same concerns about the Minister of State's indication that there will only be public consultation after a screening process, especially with regard to directives. These amendments specifically seek public consultation in all scenarios. Between these guidelines, the directives and the policy statements, there is so much leeway for a Minister to set the direction and the impact it can have.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> If the guidelines are of significance, and they will be, the Minister will not set them for no reason. We have seen in other planning areas where guidelines can have a major impact. Whether a screening process decides public consultation is required or not, it is very clear that public consultation is needed given that these guidelines will be of significance. They are significant enough to be in the legislation we are discussing now and what is to be put on a statutory basis. Given the extent of the powers, they are significant enough to go to public consultation as part of a system of checks and balances on these quite strong powers that the Minister is to be given with the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">The Minister of State knows quite well that we are not talking about typos and that our concern is that guidelines which could have a real, substantial and material impact should be subject to a requirement for public consultation. It is a similar idea with directives. I am looking at this stuff and trying to get my head around it. There are some people watching this and trying to get their heads around it. It would be useful for the Minister of State to give some examples of what these cases might be. What would a policy statement, guideline or directive look like? That is so we can understand exactly what we are talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> It seems that guidelines are pretty important and that a directive is also pretty important. If they are going to have a substantial impact on marine planning and development, it is absolutely reasonable to ensure the public can have its say. That should not in any way take us outside compliance with directives and other elements that protect the marine environment and public interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I thank the Deputies for their engagement. In the context of typographical errors, I refer to amendment No. 52 in which it is explicitly stated that any amendment shall be required to be the subject of public consultation. That is the amendment to which I referred in saying that consultation would be required if a typographical error had to be amended subsequent to the issuing of guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> On the development of guidelines, as a matter of course, a series of stakeholders are engaged to develop the guidelines in the first instance. That is why we have screening, which functions as a mechanism to decide the sensitivities in the guidelines, including whether we require consultation or a strategic environmental assessment. These are the key safeguards built into the system in order to ensure that the guidelines are appropriate and go to the appropriate thresholds of public consultation in their genesis. That must be clear. Sticking to the technical aspect of the Bill, section 7(2) details what public bodies have regard to with respect to ministerial guidelines.</p>

There is a reason for guidelines coming about and, on that basis, you would engage with stakeholders to try to develop the best guidelines possible.

          <p eId="para_104">The point we are trying to make is that it should be set out in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">For quite a long Bill, it has only eight short sections on ministerial guidelines, which is a relatively small amount of text. They do not flesh the consultation process and what engagement should and must be done. The level of discretion the Bill leaves is the issue I am raising. I would be more than happy, for example, if the text of the amendment was changed to refer to "any material amendment". This would address the issue of typos and so on, which the Minister of State raised. That could easily be done. The guidelines in the Bill on what the Minister does and the process around that are fluid. The text does not specify processes for consultation at the beginning of the process. The legislation would benefit from having those in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">On a point of order and with all due respect, we are trying to get to the bottom of what a guideline is. This section is dealing with guidelines and our amendments refer to the importance of setting out the need, explicitly, for public consultation on guidelines. It is entirely relevant in that context for people, including me as somebody who is supposed to be scrutinising this legislation, to be absolutely clear what exactly we are talking about when we talk about guidelines and what the difference is between a guideline, a directive and a policy statement. It is absolutely a legitimate question.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">The policy statement, as we discussed in the previous session, sits at the top of the hierarchy. That is in the terrestrial planning policy. It sets out the high-level objectives in terms of the way our planning system should perform in a sustainable manner. Sitting under that, we have the national marine planning framework and, in respect of onshore, the national planning framework. The Minister can also issue directions and guidelines. Directions involve being more explicit because the Minister will be directing a particular course of events. For instance, in the event that an entity such as the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, does not do what the policy says it should do, the Minister may issue a direction to ensure that it does so. Guidelines are more subjective. We have offshore renewable energy guidelines, for example. Guidelines involve trying to guide the decision-making process to get the best outcome, whereas a direction is more specific and clear. That is my best attempt at explaining. Maybe that does not meet the standard the Deputy requires but it is the best I can do at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">This follows on from what the Minister of State just said because we are finally getting some clarity on this. Amendment No. 49 deals with section 7(2) in which the two phrases, "having regard to the guidelines" and "shall consider", are used. I am hoping the Minister of State will tell us that this does not have the same legal force as section 28 mandatory ministerial guidelines in terrestrial planning. Even though they are called guidelines, they are actually directives although they are just not described as such. On the basis of what the Minister of State outlined, is it correct to assume that these ministerial guidelines will be more procedural? For example, if the objective of the planning policy statement is X, the guideline is setting out how the relevant public body will get to achieve X.<i>
						</i>Rather than setting out a policy principle, it sets out how to reach something. I am looking for the Minister of State to say that these guidelines are not mandatory and that they are procedural rather than substantive, if that makes sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">This is the bit that confuses me because in some circumstances the guidelines are a guideline while in another circumstance, they are about complying rather than being a guideline.

          <p eId="para_129">This is precisely the point I was trying to make earlier. The Minister of State's answer to the distinction between guidelines and directives was that the former set general parameters and that where there are specific objectives, there is a directive. Section 7(3) refers to "specific marine planning policy requirements". That sounds like a directive with which compliance is required. I do not see what the difference is between that and the directives in the section we will deal with later. It definitely does not sound like a guideline.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">Amendment No. 54 is that instead of the guidelines being laid before the Oireachtas, the environmental assessment reports are also provided and there is an opportunity, with regard to the amendment of the guidelines, provided for the assessment reports to be laid before the Oireachtas.

          <p eId="para_233"> Amendment No. 60 is about ensuring if the Oireachtas makes changes to the guidelines, it does so in accordance with the frameworks and directives set out in section 6(3) and that will ensure the Oireachtas is informed by the proper considerations and obligations in making decisions on the guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Amendment No. 64 is similar to Amendment No. 60 in that it would ensure the Oireachtas, if it makes changes to directives, does so in accordance with the frameworks and directives set out in section 6 to ensure it is informed by the proper considerations and obligations in making a decision on the directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Amendment No. 71 is also to ensure if the Oireachtas makes changes to policy, it does so in accordance with frameworks and directives set out in section 6(3), for the same reasons that the Oireachtas makes considerations and obligations in line with those directives.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">All the amendments try to ensure the Oireachtas and its committees are fully alerted to any guidelines or directives being developed; the individual Members of the Oireachtas and committees have the right to put forward resolutions on those and any such guidelines have to be voted on by both Houses and there is full notification of the public and the Oireachtas on all of these. As for my suggestion, on which the Minister of State seemed to look somewhat favourably the last time, in addition to what we have proposed in these amendments about newspapers and other forms of publications, one can take it as a standing request from me to consider radio ads for all of these things. When we are discussing the notification of the public, we need to think about other means of getting over the fact the public just do not know. They do not see these newspaper ads and so on. The point is to let everybody in the Oireachtas and the public know; ensure the Oireachtas votes on it and has input into these guidelines and directives and the public is aware of them and has opportunities to make its views known. That is the logic of these amendments and they are reasonable suggestions.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">The wording of the amendments is very similar to the wording of similar amendments to section 6, which are about Oireachtas participation. We will not repeat the whole debate we had previously. Some of us would like to hear, and something with which the Minister of State is familiar because he does it with us regularly in committee, when there are changes to certain aspects of planning policy that there is a procedure where they are brought in at least to an Oireachtas committee and there is a discussion and a motion with or without debate to clear those through. I am not proposing that same mechanism, but what motivated the three of us here who put our names to this is we would like to see some greater role. The Minister of State's officials will have advised him this is a far too onerous set of requirements we are setting out and he will not support those, but is there willingness to conceive of some formal role or process for the Oireachtas to be involved in this, in the way we often are? Solar panels or some of the emergency measures introduced in planning about on-street dining and such are examples. Some of those are planning guidelines. How can we better involve the Oireachtas? If the Minister of State is rejecting what we proposed, which we know he is, and that is his absolute right, can he at least take the spirit of what we are talking about and examine it? There is merit in engaging with the collective experience of the Oireachtas and members of relevant committees, but also for public confidence in those guidelines because of the involvement of committee and public transparency etc.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Burke<recordedTime time="2021-10-21T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_238">This grouping of amendments proposes similar Oireachtas engagement procedures for guidelines and directives to those proposed earlier for the marine planning policy statement, MPPS, and are equally problematic. The net effect of the proposals would be that the Oireachtas would take the role of the Minister of the day on a day-to-day operational level of the planning regime. The Oireachtas is not and cannot be the marine spatial planning body. The text is largely copied from those earlier amendments and, as such, contains the same technical deficiencies as already debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The requirement for such detailed engagement with the Oireachtas would limit the finalisation of such documents to the periods in which the Oireachtas was sitting and had the available capacity to deal with such matters. Such a restriction brings with it the problematic risk of the entire marine planning system grinding to a halt during periods in which the Oireachtas was not sitting or did not have capacity where a guideline or directive was necessary to ensure legally robust functioning of the planning system. That would be an unprecedented constraint for any regulatory system and I sincerely doubt people would thank us for introducing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Amendment No. 54 sets out the process for the Oireachtas approval, which is entirely inappropriate for ministerial guidelines and would be inconsistent with other provisions on the Statute Book. Amendment No. 60 limits such guidance to the consideration of specific matters which are in the formulation of an amendment that has already been rejected. Amendment No. 64 again sets out an Oireachtas process entirely at odds with the purpose of a ministerial function. Amendment No. 71 sets out limits on such directives to the consideration of such matters which are in the formulation of an amendment already rejected. I oppose these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I remind Deputies resolutions were passed for the national marine planning framework. We have agreed, through this committee, to go for a resolution for the MPPS. That was a commitment given at the first session. Designated maritime area plans, DMAPS, will require a resolution through the Houses. I am clear in my mind that Government sets the policy and the Oireachtas holds it to account on such policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">I could be very ungenerous and say there are times when the planning system grinds to a halt all by itself without any Oireachtas interference or scrutiny. That is an argument for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> On the last question I asked, does the Minister of State not see any link between the role given to the Oireachtas committee on regulatory changes concerning terrestrial planning and the role under discussion? Is it not a matter he would at least explore? I realise he is not going to accept these amendments, and I am not going to waste his time arguing in favour of them, but he should note the planning system does not grind to a halt under a system whereby minor and, at times, significant changes to planning regulations are brought to an Oireachtas committee and then approved without debate on the floor of the Dáil. Since the guidelines are similar, is there not some parallel that could be considered, if I am not misinterpreting the matter? I am not referring to consideration today but to consideration at a future point.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">Or even a provision whereby it would be open to the Dáil to ask for a debate and for the issue to be decided. There may be matters that do not require this but directives and guidelines should, at a minimum, be discussed by a committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> There are matters that the Business Committee is happy to have a committee deal with, while there are others regarding which it is not satisfied to have a committee alone deal in the belief that they need to be discussed and passed by the Dáil. Sometimes it is agreed, even by the Government, that there are matters of great enough significance to warrant that, but it is not required as a matter of course. The Department and Minister of State should consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> We are in new planning territory. We are trying to build a planning and development regime from scratch in an area where there was nothing. There is a need for checks and balances when starting from scratch in respect of an important area, the maritime area, and we must ensure that we do not make the mistakes that were made on land in the past. The checks and balances we are requiring a reasonable. If our proposals are a little over the top or onerous in the view of the Minister of State, could we make provision for at least a committee to have some role and afford the Dáil the possibility of debating these matters and, where necessary, resolutions, when it deems it important?</p>

          <p eId="para_250">The legislation gives the Minister quite a significant power concerning the issuing of directives. The Minister of State said the Minister sets the policy and the Oireachtas holds him to account. However, where is the ability of the Oireachtas to hold the Minister to account regarding directives? This section allows for the laying of a policy directive before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but that is it. Where else can the Oireachtas have an input? Could the Minister of State comment on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_251">I thank the Deputies for their comments. I draw their attention to section 7, which is clear, in respect of the requirements for ministerial guidelines, about what is to be laid before the Houses. Regarding section 28, Deputy Ó Broin gave valuable examples of where the Oireachtas committee engaged on guidelines that had been issued. I remind him that it was not the result of a mandatory requirement, but it happened. That is why I expect the same value can be derived from the committee system regarding the guidelines in question that are to be issued. There is nothing preventing a committee from examining items that are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas if it sees fit to do so and if the members believe they can add value to the process. I am very clear about the process whereby the Government governs. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, as a Member of the Dáil, has ample opportunity to hold the Government to account regarding any regulations a Minister issues. He could see the value during the Covid period. He will have noted the role of committees regarding emergency guidelines that were introduced and the arrangements as we emerged from the pandemic. It is a very valuable role.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the ministerial guidelines are published online. For the purposes of transparency and openness, it is very important that people can access them. Amendment No. 56 is similar in ensuring ready online access in terms of the publication of the guidelines. The purpose of amendment No. 57 is to ensure that they are published to the fullest extent possible online. Amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive, are similar. I do not see why there would be an issue with this.

          <p eId="para_270">The reason for the repetition of the text in amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive, is that they apply to public bodies. It is very important that where those guidelines relate to a public body, they are published on the public body's websites as well as the Department website. Individuals, organisations or communities may track the public body as opposed to the Department, and there is a value in that. The amendments are eminently sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> On amendments Nos. 57 and 67, the concern is that while there is a requirement for publication, the relevant sections do not stipulate the extent to which things should be published. It could be a summary, a note or whatever. We are trying to ensure that where they are published, it will be done in a way that will provide benefit and clarity for the public and-or promote environmental protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">I thank the members for their amendments. This grouping contains certain technical amendments to the publication procedures in respect of guidelines and are repeated verbatim for directives. The amendments are not necessary. The current text already provides for publication on websites. It is also intended to publish or provide a link to those documents on the marine spatial planning data tool that is currently being developed by my green planning team and the Marine Institute and that is due to be launched to coincide with the enactment of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The GIS-based digital tool will be a portal containing a wealth of marine development information gathered in one location and will include such guidelines and directives. It will display planning applications and consents. Importantly the tool will be available to all members of the public to view on their laptops and mobile devices. Some developers will be discouraged by this, but I make no apology for maintaining and building on the ethos of informing the public as to what is happening or is planned to happen in their maritime area. The marine planning system we are establishing in legislation will operate in an accessible information-rich environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Amendment No. 55 proposes publication of the guidelines on the public body's website, which is standard practice. Amendment No. 56 proposes publication of the guidelines on a website of the Government, which is standard practice. Amendment No. 57 proposes inappropriate limitations on the circumstances where the Minister can publish guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Amendment No. 65 proposes publication of directives on the public body's website, which is standard practice. Amendment No. 66 proposes publication of the directives on a website of the Government, which is standard practice. Amendment No. 67 proposes inappropriate limitations on the circumstances where the Minister can publish directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">This is a frequent theme throughout several amendments and assumes that the Government does not, as a matter of course, publish material appropriately on its website and in other media. This is, of course, simply not the case. We use all manner of communications and we always avail of emerging technologies to communicate with the public. I note that Deputy Boyd Barrett in the last session made the case that perhaps limiting publication to newspapers might be unnecessarily restrictive given the perhaps somewhat outdated nature of the circulation of hard copies of such publications. Similarly, proposed insertions relating to specific media, such as websites, could, in time, also be considered out of date. We want to future-proof this Bill and make it agile enough to keep pace with the ever-evolving media environment. The drafting of the legislation reflects this ambition. It is not about doing one particular thing but about being able to do all manner of things in the media environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The portal is welcome. I ask him to consider two things. Unfortunately, not all public bodies necessarily have the same practice as some Departments. Equally, not all Departments necessarily operate in the same way. Many of us have difficulty accessing guidance documents and circulars from particular Departments and we end up having to submit parliamentary questions in this regard. I acknowledge that is not the same kind of document but it is a parallel situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> All I ask of the Minister of State is that, in his engagements with the relevant public bodies after this legislation has passed, he ensure that access to links and updates concerning what goes on the portal are shared as widely as possible. Portals will be useful for some of us because we will have a grasp of the totality of the information. Sometimes people will not go to a portal but to a public agency or body and having the relevant links in that context would be useful. If the Minister of State is not willing to consider our finely crafted amendments, then at least he might consider chatting to people in some of those public bodies. We might make some progress in this regard as well.</p>

I appreciate that the area of communications and media is a rapidly evolving one and that we must be open enough to ensure that we are speaking to all the relevant demographics and constituencies that access their information through different media.

          <p eId="para_282">I do not think that any assumptions are being made in the amendments regarding current standard practice. The fact that it is standard practice and good practice is a reason for putting this aspect into the legislation. I take the point, though, that none of us knows what the best place for information will be in 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 years' time. If we look through legislation, however, it generally deals with the here and now and prevailing procedural processes. While we do not know how all this is going to evolve, we do know that our website is going to be an important place for finding and accessing information over the next decade. We know that much. Websites may well evolve but they are not going to disappear overnight. My preference, therefore, would be to have this good practice specified in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I genuinely think that we are at one on all this. It is the Government's interest to ensure that all information is published. Anyone objectively examining how we went about our business in respect of undertaking consultation on the national marine planning framework right around the country will see that it was all about ensuring transparency and openness. It involved going into fishing villages, working with communities and trying to get their views. All the meetings that I had the privilege of chairing online were concerned with enabling transparency and openness and with trying to bring as many people on board as possible in that regard. We will continue to do that.</p>

Turning to what Deputy Cian O’Callaghan said, the marine spatial planning data tool is a portal and it is possible to see immediately how amendments like this can be counterproductive. As I said, we want to future-proof the legislation. It is the practice of the Government and of my Department to publish all these items on our websites. We encourage and we will be after public bodies to do the same. We have no issue with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">By this stage, of course, the Minister of State and his officials will have rumbled our cunning tactical strategy to make similar points regarding different sections of the Bill. We are doing so, however, because we are genuinely keen to ensure, whether we are talking about the policy statement, the policy guidelines, the policy directives, the special plans or the DMAPs, that the inputs into those policy statements and various EU and domestic legal requirements are adhered to, to the maximum possible extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> I will not go through all the same arguments as when we proposed a similar set of amendments to section 6. The fact, however, that we have had to tease out with the Minister of State, and he has been gracious with his time, explanations for each of these parts of the policy guidelines framework and how they interact speaks to these aspects not being clear to those of us who read the legislation. While it is clear to the Minister of State and his officials, many people will have to use this legislation, including people from industry, fishermen and fisherwomen, coastal communities and environmental NGOs, for example. Therefore, the maximum amount of clarity not only regarding what these different pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will do but how they will be fully compliant with EU and domestic law and how we are going to ensure the appropriate inputs and outputs is key in this regard. To progress the matter, I will not speak individually to each of the amendments. The points are the same as those that I made regarding section 6. We still think it is important, however, to raise this now.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">As Deputy Ó Broin said, these are similar to the previous amendments but relate to the directives and guidelines. These are key aspects and these amendments shall be incorporated into the legislation. It is important to explicitly write in that when directives and guidelines are being drawn up, they specify that the Minister must act in accordance with the birds directive, the habitats directive and the marine strategy framework. Such an inclusion would strengthen the assurances in respect of the Minister's wide-ranging powers. It would grant a greater level of protection in respect of our marine biodiversity and marine environment. I will not dwell on this point for long but, as others have said, these issues are of major importance, especially to coastal communities and people working in fishing, regarding developing sustainable fishing practices and protecting our marine wildlife. I could not think of a better way of strengthening the Bill than passing these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">To summarise, the points have been made on the policy statement, the guidelines and the directives. The Minister of State's response, essentially, is to say that this is dealt with in section 31, and that our concerns around the public consultation, the screening for strategic environmental assessments, SEAs, and the compliance with all of the relevant directives are dealt with in section 31. There is no point in repeating ourselves, but I believe that we need to look to see if we are completely happy that it is all covered off under section 31. That is probably the job we have to do between now and Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">I thank the members for their comments. This grouping of amendments proposes revised considerations of the development of guidelines and directives and, as already stated by committee members in relation to the repetition, the plans prepared under this Bill are subject to all of the things set out in these amendments. What the amendments are attempting to achieve has already been achieved. The Bill is not a series of independent sections all of which need this level of technical drafting, rather it is a series of interconnected parts, each designed to supplement the other. One does not achieve compliance with any of the directives listed here by just liberally referencing each of them in various parts of the Bill. That is not how it works from a technical point of view. We must be sure that each part is, in and of itself, operable.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Amendment No. 58 sets out technically deficient considerations for the development of guidelines. The obligations set out would be almost impossible to comply with for the specific matters requiring direction or guidance. The obligations referenced are set out elsewhere in the Bill with regard to forward planning or compliance with environmental directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Amendment No. 59 relies on technically deficient section 6(3) proposed under amendment No. 33. Amendment No. 69 sets out technically deficient considerations for the development of directives that would, invariably, be impossible to comply with. Amendment No. 70 also relies on technically deficient section 6(3) proposed under amendment No. 33. I oppose these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">Will the Minister of State expand on why it would not be possible to comply with the requirements set out under our amendments? These amendments are much stronger than section 31 of the Bill and they are more detailed. As we discussed earlier in the week, they also have that hierarchy, which is important, and list the maritime spatial planning directive and our amendments to the marine strategy framework directive. Section 31 of the Bill does not list those and they are very important. I appreciate that they are referenced elsewhere under the directions of the Minister, but the all-encompassing section 31 does not list the maritime spatial planning directive or the marine strategy framework directive. These are very important for everything to do with maritime area planning. The Minister of State might elaborate on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">Absolutely. It is because it is totally incoherent and totally inoperable. I ask the Deputy to consider what he is asking. In amendment No. 58, subsection (a), the Deputy is asking to act consistently with totally unrelated bodies. It is totally incoherent and we have already provided for it in a structured way that interconnects throughout the Bill. What the Deputy is proposing is totally inoperable. It just liberally lists off every single piece that is not related to act consistently with directives that are nowhere related to each other. As I have said, I have already provided for this in section 31 of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">The Minister of State clearly has a different view on this, but to me, these directives are highly relevant to marine spatial planning. The maritime spatial planning directive, for example, is not listed in section 31. It is not there. I believe that this is highly relevant to the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021. I am quite concerned that the Minister of State is of the view that these guidelines, such as the maritime spatial planning directive, are somehow totally irrelevant. I do not understand that. I might be misunderstanding the Minister of State because I do not believe the Minister of State could be saying that these directives are irrelevant. They are obviously core to maritime area planning. Perhaps we could just get better clarification on that. I feel I must be misunderstanding Minister of State's comments.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">Separate from the amendment, is the Minister of State actually suggesting that there could be a guideline that would not comply with these very clear legal obligations under EU law? Clearly, one guideline might not be relevant to all that is listed, but any guideline that is relevant to any of those directives surely has to comply with them. The Minister of State might have been a little bit over enthusiastic in his rebuttal of the amendment.</p>

I see that we are coming up to another aspect which is a "direction". It should be very interesting to debate what is the difference between a directive and a direction, but we will move on to that one. The Minister of State's argument is to repeat these endlessly for each different stage and step and part of this process. I do not quite see why the Minister of State used the word "inoperable". The Minister of State might just say "unnecessary". I am not quite sure how the amendment would make the Bill inoperable. Perhaps the Minister of State will explain why it makes it inoperable. Surely the Minister of State is saying that it is not necessary because it is all covered under section 31. If everything we are looking for is under section 31, it is there already and what we are proposing is superfluous. This is what I thought I heard the Minister of State saying and now-----</p>

          <p eId="para_358">To be very clear, I, as Minister of State, am obliged under EU law to comply with all directives. That is a fact. We are obliged to adhere to and comply with all directives. No matter how much we tease it out or go into it I am being very clear in the response that those obligations are already in the Bill. Just because the Deputies want to repeat them in every section will not make this better legislation when we must already comply with those objectives and thresholds.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">Yes, but there have been failures to transpose and failures to comply with directives. We have suffered big fines and there have been big oversights with respect to real things that have happened in the real world. There were subsequent acknowledgements we messed up and failed to comply. Some of these issues are outstanding. This is not a small matter. I understand the marine spatial planning framework directive is referred to in the Schedule. I get that. Let us say we concede the Minister of State is correct - I am not saying we are at this stage but we hear him - and there is no need to repeat endlessly the need to comply with everything as it is covered anyway. We are asking why, if it is all covered in section 31, would the Government not have that list once in section 31, which includes the reference to the other directives alongside the ones it has put in there, namely those on birds and habitats. That is a fair question.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I have a related question. This gets to the nub of it. If we got clarity on this we could move through this Bill much more quickly. Is it correct that these directives would require that before consents for development are given, the directives are fully complied with, which is what Europe wants, and then we can move to the issue of applications, consents, enforcement and all the rest of it but in the first instance we must have a plan, which must be compliant with the various directives? Rightly or wrongly, we have a concern that there may be development consents given where those plans are not fully in place. In particular, the relevant projects could get consents when plans are not in place. How would that stand in respect of the directives? That is one of our central concerns and one of the central concerns of people looking in here. If we could get clarity, it would help. Have people reason to be concerned? The ideal would be to have the marine plan, which is similar to a development plan. We know what can be done here and there and people will only be allowed do things in those places. Once this is up and running fully that might be the way it is going to be but in advance of that people do not necessarily have to be subject to a plan. If that is the case then that is our concern. Clarity on that would help us a lot.</p>

It has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas through resolution and all planning permissions must comply with it. Thus it is absolutely clear it must comply with all directives.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">Fully accepted. However, it is still not as specific as a DMAP or another plan with an acronym might be. Therefore, there is more flexibility for things to happen than there might be under a more specific plan. There is a difference between a framework and a DMAP. I am concerned that, if someone can get a development consent on the basis of a fairly general framework, it will be an easier threshold for a developer to pass than a DMAP or a more specific spatial plan under which we had decided that an area was protected, developers could do something in another area, etc. The framework does not go to that level of detail, yet we are envisaging that we will have plans that are that specific. Indeed, good and sustainable planning requires that level of specificity. This is the nub of our concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">My position on this is that the Bill should be explicit in terms of the Minister and compliance with the maritime spatial planning directive and the marine strategy directive. This matter is not covered in section 31. I appreciate that the Government must comply with all EU directives, but that does not always happen in full. Indeed, fines have been paid over non-compliance. The Bill is much weaker for not having this explicit provision and there could be consequences to that. We have been slow in following these directives and have not been following them strongly enough. That is evident in how far behind other countries we are due to our slow approach to marine protected areas and how it has not been prioritised and resourced as it should be.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_417">In page 25, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_418">"(3) The Minister shall ensure any new policy directives, or revocation or amendment of policy directives made under this section, shall be limited in accordance with the policies in the maritime planning policy statement.".</p>
          <p eId="para_419">In the same way that it was helpful for the Minister of State to clarify the mandatory and non-mandatory guidelines, it would be helpful if he could, even in summary form, make as clear as possible the distinction between the mandatory and non-mandatory guidelines and policy directives. The amendment is fairly self-explanatory. It proposes that policy directives, and any revocation or amendment of them, should be fully consistent with the marine planning policy statement. I presume that will be the case but it would be nice to ensure it is legally required.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">As Deputy Ó Broin indicated, this amendment seeks to ensure that any new policy directives would be limited by the requirement to be in accordance with the policies in the MPPS. If the Minister of State is not happy with the inclusion of this provision in the Bill, I would like to know why and in what circumstances he foresees that there might be new policy directives that would not be in accordance with the MPPS. What types of situations would they be? If he does not agree with the amendment, will he say why it is not needed?</p>

          <p eId="para_421">Amendment No. 63 proposes to limit directives inappropriately to policies set out under the MPPS. This is an inordinate restriction and would preclude the issuing of directives on other necessary matters, such as where new domestic or European case law has clarified the operation of a procedure or EU directive and public bodies need to be instructed accordingly to ensure legally robust decision-making. Therefore, I oppose the amendment. In essence, the purpose of a policy directive is, as I said, to instruct a body to comply with policy in an area where it may not be compliant.</p>

Many of us are trying to understand what the scope of the policy directives is and what kinds of matter they would include. The purpose of tabling this amendment is to afford the Minister of State the opportunity to give the committee, inasmuch as he can, a general list of the types of area such directives could include. Obviously, directives will not just deal with issues of environmental protection, marine biodiversity and avian species. Giving us as much clarity as possible in this regard would be helpful.

This Bill, as a whole, will result in a greater level of protection for the entire maritime area than has previously been the case. It introduces a plan-led system, previously lacking, and a consent regime that heretofore only applied to a limited area. The NMPF, on which a great deal of decision making rests, sets out a series of directional policies in respect of the protection of the marine environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> While I agree with the sentiment of protecting the environment and taking seriously the protection of marine biodiversity, I oppose the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">None of that surprises me. I am not asking the Minister of State to give us an exhaustive list of every area that such policy directives would include, but could he give us a flavour of the kinds of area? Some of us know what most of them would be from reading the Bill, but it would be helpful if the Minister of State put them on the public record.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">I move amendment No. 73:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_582">In page 27, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_583">" "maritime spatial planning" means—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_584">(a) a process by which the relevant Member State’s authorities analyse and organise human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological, economic and social objectives, as defined in Article 3(2) of the MSP Directive, and in so doing the competent authority (M) or competent authority (D) shall—</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_585">(I) act within the context of the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) which includes, as its environmental pillar, Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_586">(II) support the sustainable development of seas and oceans,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_587">(III) develop coordinated, coherent and transparent decision-making in relation to the maritime sectors,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_588">whilst achieving good environmental status, in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, and as set out in recital 2 of the MSP Directive, on the objective of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_589">(b) that maritime spatial planning shall thus be informed by, and act within that constraint of achieving good environmental status, and shall—</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_590">(I) take into account land-sea interactions in accordance with Article 4(2) of the MSP Directive,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_591">(II) contribute to the objectives listed in Article 5 of the MSP Directive, applying an ecosystem-based approach, and to promote the coexistence of relevant activities and uses,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_592">(III) fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 6 of the MSP Directive in respect of how MSPs are developed, as required by Article 4(4) of the MSP Directive,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_593">(IV) fulfil the requirements of Article 8 of the MSP Directive on what they shall identify and contain, as required by Article 4(4) of the MSP Directive,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_594">(c) have due regard to the particularities of the marine regions, relevant existing and future activities and uses and their impacts on the environment, as well as to natural resources, and shall also take into account land-sea interactions, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_595">(d) may include or build on existing national policies, regulations or mechanisms, provided they are in conformity with, and consistent with, the requirements and objectives of the MSP Directive, and where such policies have been made and approved by the Oireachtas;".</p>
          <p eId="para_596">These amendments are about providing alternative definitions and objectives for the marine spatial planning with a stronger focus on environmental and social requirements. What is encompassed by maritime spatial planning must be clearly set out in the Bill, and it is very important we do it so we do not end up before national and EU courts and create potential delays in marine activity. It is essential we have sufficient marine protection with an emphasis on rehabilitation and conservation, which we are legally obliged to deliver. We should already have delivered that and we have been remiss in not putting in place sufficient marine protection, rehabilitation and conservation. We must move very swiftly to ensure we do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> There are other complex environmental considerations that must also be taken into account in spatial planning. This is not discretionary, and that is why I spoke before about the importance of the directives relating to marine planning in that respect. They are legal requirements and are not discretionary. That is why it is important with the directives to understand the difference between transposition of a directive and conformity with directives. That relates to our previous conversation and it is why there are checks both on transposition and conformity. Of course, conformity is all about compatibility. What I was seeking in previous amendments was to ensure compatibility and what I am trying to do with this amendment is ensure compatibility as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I can give an example of good practice from another jurisdiction that relates to marine rehabilitation and conservation. Scotland has set up the Scottish marine environmental enhancement fund. It is a very good model and something we should do here. All wind and renewable energy in the marine environment has a condition of the licence that there must be a contribution to the fund. The fund is used to support communities, environmental and coastal groups that work in the marine and it allows them to carry out marine biodiversity projects, along with conservation and rehabilitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> It is very important we write into the Bill as much as possible measures that will lead to that sort of good practice seen in Scotland. That is why I am putting forward these amendments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2021-10-21T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_600">Given we have only a few minutes left, I reserve the right to come back on some of the latter amendments in this group as I will only get to the first few.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Again, some of my questioning is really just an invitation for the Minister of State to explain the intricacies of this process a little more on the public record. Most of us have experience of terrestrial planning and we know the planning framework is the overarching strategy. There are also county and city development plans and local area plans, with ministerial guidelines in between, some of which are controversial and some of which are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I am understanding it better as we go through this process but we have a marine planning policy statement, a marine planning framework and then maritime and spatial plans. We will get on to designated marine area plans, DMAPs, in a later section. Specifically with the maritime spatial plan, I am still not clear what it brings to this part of the architecture that is not already in the other elements. My understanding is it may be geographically more limited and there may be some more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> At an earlier stage the Minister of State said there is no plan as detailed as the marine planning framework. In some sense that is probably not an accurate way to describe it in the sense-----</p>

          <p eId="para_605">It is the only State-wide plan so that is a fair caveat. Let me get back to the detailed point because this is important. With a county development plan, for example, we have all the land uses mapped out and agreed. This is pertinent to the session we will have with the other Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, around marine protected areas, because until we have those or the interim measures, there will be a missing piece in the jigsaw. In the Minister of State's response to amendment No. 73, will he delineate what is the maritime spatial plan as distinct from the bits above and below it? As Deputy O'Callaghan mentions, we are proposing in the amendment to give some clarity to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> We know the Minister of State will not accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">We know that, and the Minister of State will set out the technical reasons for it. It would also be helpful if he were also to set out what is to be in that plan. Am I out of time or may I go on to the next one?</p>
