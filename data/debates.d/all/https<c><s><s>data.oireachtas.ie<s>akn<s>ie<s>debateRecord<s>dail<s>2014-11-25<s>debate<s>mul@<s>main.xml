            <p eId="para_1">96. <b>Deputy Dara Calleary</b> asked the <b>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</b> his views on competitiveness in the economy in view of recent inflation data which indicates that the cost of Government-controlled services and utilities is rising much faster than the general prices; the actions he is taking to improve competitiveness in the economy generally, including implementing recommendations from the National Competitiveness Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [44526/14]</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">The National Competitiveness Council published its annual report in April and the then chief executive for Forfás, now the chief executive of IDA Ireland, Mr. Martin Shanahan, said that we must relentlessly pursue further improvements in our cost competitiveness and that we cannot afford any slippage. What has the Minister done about that report since April? What action has he taken on it? Where does our competitiveness now lie six months later?</p>

            <p eId="para_3">That is a slightly different question from the one the Deputy asked. The position in regard to competitiveness generally is one where we have seen a very significant improvement in recent years. Ireland's international competitiveness rankings have improved from 24th to 15th in the IMD's world competitiveness yearbook report and from 29th to 25th in the WEF global competitiveness report. If one looks at the harmonised index of competitiveness, which is tracked by the Central Bank, we have shown significant improvements in our cost position and that is reflected by the surveys of the National Competitiveness Council which look at significant areas where there have been real improvements in our competitiveness in terms of individual costs. However, they underline the need for continual vigilance in the area of competitiveness. Obviously, there are always risks and it has pointed to particular sectors where risk arises.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The original question referred to utilities and Government controlled services. In regard to the cost of those services, the range of goods and services the CSO classifies as "administered" by central, regional or local government or national regulators represent a small subset of the overall CPI basket in the areas of hospital services, gas, passenger transport and postal services. Prices for most utilities, such as waste management and electricity, are market driven and, therefore, not set by Government. Alternatively, in some cases, such as the cost of public transport, prices are approved by an external independent regulator. It is, however, important that we remain vigilant in regard to future price increases. I can assure the Deputy that the competitiveness challenge is a very live one and we are very alert to the need to make continual improvements.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_5">Question No. 96 mentions the National Competitiveness Council's recommendations. I presume we are on the same question. That report showed last April that diesel prices in Ireland are 7% more expensive than in the euro area, Ireland's electricity costs are the fifth most expensive in the euro area, and landfill gate fees are the fifth most expensive of the ten countries surveyed. It is the fifth most expensive location out of 16 for industrial water costs. Our new business interest rates are higher, with loan rates 31% higher than in most of the euro area. The report tracks a big increase in the cost of business services and other inputs. Prices in the third quarter were 3.4% higher than those in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> There is an absolute drift in cost management. Electricity costs are still very out of sync with those in the euro area. Even allowing for our island location, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is still the main shareholder in ESB so the Government has a role to play. It is the main shareholder in all the main banks and has a big role to play in respect of interest rates. There has been so much focus on domestic water in recent weeks we forget the figure for industrial water costs. This is the fifth most expensive location for industrial water. The Government has control of that too but there is no sense of an attempt to tackle those costs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">On the harmonised index of prices across Europe, Ireland’s increase is 1.2% in the past 12 months. That is among the lowest in the EU. They are higher in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, the UK, Portugal and Finland. Ireland is controlling administrative costs more effectively than other European countries. I agree with the Deputy that there are areas where we need to continue to attend to competitiveness pressures. In the electricity area, for example, a recent restructuring programme took out cost. The focus in electricity has to be on controllable costs because some elements of electricity pricing are beyond the control of the electricity companies because they are dictated by international fuel prices. There are areas such as property, unit labour costs and professional services where we are making improvements. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, we will take on board several recommendations of the National Competitiveness Council.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">The National Competitiveness Council’s report was very straight on our costs. That was six months ago. Is the National Competitiveness Council as useful as the Fiscal Advisory Council? Is it just an expensive bauble taken out for the visitors and put back in the press when they leave? It made very clear recommendations in very direct language about our cost competitiveness. Has the decrease in oil prices over the summer been passed on in electricity costs to industrial users?</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> Four years into its term of office and three years since the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which aims to reduce legal costs, came before the House, there is no sense of urgency about it. I remind the Minister of a website which he was very familiar with ten years ago, <i>ripoff.ie</i>. It was one of his party’s websites. The message is still the same and there are areas that the Government can do something about. The National Competitiveness Council has laid out a roadmap but, unfortunately, its advice, like that of the Fiscal Advisory Council, seems irrelevant.</p>

In every area the Deputy addressed we have done better when one considers the global picture. We are influenced by international prices in the electricity area and are dependent on fossil fuels, but the ESB and other electricity companies have been focusing on controllable costs and are making progress in those areas. I am not pretending that everything is correct. We must continue to be vigilant and this year we will consider further improvements that make it easier to compete and do business.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">As the Deputy is aware, I recently published the heads of the proposed industrial relations (amendment) Bill 2014. The heads of the Bill are available and are currently the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I will set out the two main purposes of the Bill. First, it will provide for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing terms and conditions in individual enterprises. Such enterprise-level agreements will not be legally binding beyond the individual enterprise. It would not be constitutionally permissible to legislate in that way. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling in the McGowan case, enterprise-level registered employment agreements were not given general application on a sector-wide basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Separately, the Bill will provide for a new statutory framework for the establishment of minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers, particularly in the context of transnational provision of services and in the context of promoting harmonious relations between workers. In effect, this will be a framework to replace the former sectoral registered employment agreements system, which included the construction and electrical contracting sector. In this context, the new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in future, at the request separately or jointly of organisations substantially representative of employers and workers, the court can initiate a review of the pay, pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector. If it deems it appropriate, it will be able to make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter. If the Minister is satisfied that the process provided for in the new legislation has been complied with by the Labour Court, he shall make the order. The standard provisions dealing with the laying of orders before the Oireachtas are proposed. Where such an order is made in relation to a class, type or group of workers, it will be binding across the sector to which it relates and will be enforceable by the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> This mechanism is constitutionally robust compared with the previous registered employment agreement system, which was struck down by the Supreme Court. Prior to the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, that system provided for employment agreements between trade unions and employer representatives to be given general application by being registered by the Labour Court. As enterprise-level agreements never were and will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, the same constitutional issues regarding the delegation of legislative authority to the Minister that arose in the McGowan case do not apply in such cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">The Construction Industry Federation has acknowledged that there is industrial relations instability at the moment because of the absence of registered employment agreements. It has said that this is causing reputational damage to the industry. Workers are being forced into bogus self-employment contracts. They are not getting the industry wage. They are being paid below the minimum wage in this State. This practice is rife across Government contracts where the Government is the employer. I know of a young man who works for Kishogue. When he went onto the site one day, he was told he was no longer employed but instead was self-employed and was employing a handful of other workers. He was given a sum of money to pay those workers, who had not been paid for weeks. Of course that sum of money was not near to reaching the minimum wage. The Government has hidden behind the Contractors Administration Services, Scope and the National Employment Rights Authority, all of which have been completely ineffectual to date in dealing with this crisis. We need to know whether the forthcoming industrial relations Bill will deal with cases in which the principal contractor washes his or her hands of the actions of subcontractor companies. Such practices are leading to the creation of bogus self-employment contracts.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">The Deputy's initial question asked whether enterprise-level agreements will be sectorally applied. Those agreements would not be sectorally applied, of course, because they are agreed between two contracting parties, in many respects. Broadly speaking, the registered employment agreements would be applied across a sector, as was the case with the registered employment agreements system that was struck down in the McGowan case two years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">As a Government, we have worked hard to ensure that the wage-setting mechanisms sought by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and trade unions address two matters, those being, to ensure that reputable employers have a level playing pitch when tendering for work and that standards and training in the construction industry are protected. This is important if Ireland is to have a competitive advantage. Wage-setting mechanisms, joint industrial councils and so on ensured that there were always high standards of training in the construction industry. It is also important to ensure that there is not a race to the bottom in terms of workers' pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> We have worked hard to re-establish a registered employment agreement, REA, system. Six sectors of the economy were covered by the previous regime. Deputy Tóibín and colleagues have engaged heavily in the pre-legislative scrutiny process. I look forward to that continuing.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">The REAs will not be worth the paper they are written upon if the trend of direct labour within the construction industry being transformed into subcontractor self-employed labour continues. There has been a significant increase in the number of relevant contracts tax, RCT, cases. The CSO figures for the second quarter indicated a 1.14% increase in the number of people working, yet a nearly 4% increase in the number of self-employed persons. Many of the latter are RCT cases. I have with me a notice from a recruitment agency advertising "labour" in the construction industry as having no bank holidays, sick days or redundancy payments to pay. In other words, it is a form of contract that denudes the worker of every labour right that he or she should have. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has an infrastructure that is meant to investigate the false use of these subcontracting certificates, but it is so slow that workers are left on strike on building sites for months on end until the building work is completed and attention moves elsewhere. Those workers never get the justice to which they are entitled. The forthcoming industrial relations Bill will focus on ensuring decent wages for decent workers and that decent employers can be confident that they will not be undercut by unscrupulous employers, but we must also focus on the issue of forced subcontracting.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">It is a matter in which I am interested personally apart from the fact that I am the Minister of State with responsibility for it. I understand that the issues involved in the dispute in question have been referred to the Labour Court. From the industrial relations point of view, it is important that the court can make determinations on the relevant questions of employment law.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> I have every confidence in the National Employment Rights Authority's enforcement of the minimum wage legislation. I also have every confidence in the scope section of the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, the authorities that will make determinations on whether self-employment exists in a situation similar to the one referred to by Deputy Tóibín. It should be left to them. However, these kinds of situation could emerge in the continued absence of an REA-type system. We are legislating to reintroduce a wage-setting mechanism to ensure that workers are protected and adequately rewarded with a view to promoting harmonious industrial relations and affording employers a level playing field.</p>

            <p eId="para_27"> Next Friday evening, a dark cloud will hang over Carrick-on-Shannon when 160 people lose their jobs. It will not come as a shot out of the blue. There have been warning signs for the past three years. Christmas is approaching for those 160 families.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I thank the Deputy for his question, which asks what projects are in the pipeline. He will understand that any project is commercially sensitive until it is finally announced and I am not at liberty to indicate what might be in the pipeline. However, I am optimistic about projects for the future. There have been a number of good projects and good, strong announcements have been made in respect of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Ericsson and VistaMed. I take the Deputy's point regarding the position since MBNA announced its withdrawal from Carrick-on-Shannon. As the Deputy is aware, part of its book for the Irish market found a buyer in AvantCard and while the other part of its book did not. I can assure the Deputy that both my Department's agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, are working hard to seek to find whether there are alternative uses to keep together that skill base.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Overall, there has been a growth in employment within the four counties the Deputy mentions, which in regional terms span a number of regions, namely, the midlands, west and north west. At present in those regions, there are 159 IDA client companies employing 27,271 people and there has been an increase of more than 3,000 jobs by those companies over the past three years. Consequently, significant progress is being made in that area. I recognise that while all regions have seen job growth, not all regions are enjoying the same job growth. One initiative being taken this year is that my Department will publish shortly a regional enterprise framework within which it can seek to work with stakeholders in the regions to develop their regions to best effect and the IDA will be intimately involved with the work in that regard.</p>

I believe it is necessary to start dangling an odd carrot and while the financial services centre has been highly successful here in Dublin, it is necessary to look outside Dublin. It is necessary to ascertain where new things can be set up and I believe that if it were possible to dangle the carrot and to get people to set up in different parts of Ireland, it would be highly beneficial for the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">The Government offers greater aid in these regions. Under the regional aid guidelines, the Government is allowed to provide aid at a higher level in certain regions and in the recent negotiations at European Union level, the Government succeeded in getting new regions within that ambit that were areas of high unemployment. Consequently, higher supports are available. The Government has also taken an initiative in, for example, Athlone where it has built an advanced manufacturing facility because it recognises that regions need facilities. Similar initiatives have been taken in Letterkenny and in Waterford. The Department is active in this regard and is understanding of the need to drive a greater spread on multinational investment. However, I should also note that in most regions, 95% of the employment is not in IDA-sponsored companies. While much regional focus tends to be on the 5% that is IDA-sponsored, I regard the 95% of employment that is not to be just as important and the Department seeks to work with such employers through Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices and so on. That is the intention of the regional enterprise strategy, namely, to look right across the spectrum of multinational and nationally-owned enterprise.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">While one talks about creating employment in this country, I refer to a matter about which I spoke to the Minister in recent days.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">I spent the weekend on the telephone trying to get to the get to the bottom of it. An EU directive has been introduced and it has resulted in job losses at a number of the SMEs to which the Minister refers. Rules and regulations are being imposed but information in respect of them is not being provided. When one contacts a particular State body about this issue, one is referred to another. I contacted several such bodies in recent days. We are hitting a wall when it comes to obtaining information and, at the same time, jobs are being lost. When regulations are introduced or changes are made, a message must be sent out to indicate what is happening. In addition, training must be provided in order to ensure that jobs will not be lost. The sad reality is that a further nine jobs were lost at an SME in the west last weekend as a result of the introduction of EU regulations. Basically, people are afraid because they do not know where to turn. If we do not take action, more and more jobs will be lost.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">To be fair, the Government has set its face towards reducing regulation. This is reflected in Ireland's improved position in the ease-of-doing-business rankings. We have removed many obstacles. For example, with the assistance of the House we have simplified many aspects of company law. In addition, we have sought to make it easier to do business in many areas. The Deputy drew my attention to an issue relating to a particular directive which is not relevant to my Department but which I am pursing on his behalf with the Department concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> This matter is arising on a continual basis. Each regulation introduced is designed to protect a public interest. We must find a way of making it easy to comply with such regulations. The HSA is exemplary in this regard. It has used the BeSMART technique to make it easier for farm businesses and other businesses to comply with their safety obligations, which is extremely important in terms of protecting people. If we can make compliance easier for people, then it is a win-win scenario. In the context of regulation, we are seeking to avoid unnecessary obligations being placed on businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">In order to put Deputy Calleary's mind at ease, I wish to state that following the commencement of the Industrial Development (Forfás Dissolution) Act 2014 on 1 August 2014, Forfás's policy functions have been integrated within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The policy research and advisory functions of Forfás have transferred in totality to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and form the core of its strategic policy division. The former staff of Forfás, together with a number of existing staff from the Department, form the core of this newly-created division. A very strong unit has been developed as a result. The objective of integrating Forfás with the Department's existing resources is to further enhance the formulation and development of national enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation policy. The integration is ensuring that the best available resources of the Department and Forfás will be collectively harnessed and focused on evaluating, designing and executing an ambitious enterprise and jobs strategies, at this pivotal time in economic and enterprise development.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The key elements of the role of the strategic policy division include the areas of enterprise policy, competitiveness, the enterprise aspects of tax policy, education, skills and labour market analysis and economic infrastructure. It also provides research support in the Department in respect of the areas of trade, innovation and climate change, together with economic and data analysis generally. The survey activity previously carried out by Forfás, which provides a key element of the policy research capability, is now being undertaken by the strategic policy division. The research budgets associated with the former Forfás policy activities continue to be available within the Department. When the legislation was debated in the House, the Deputy was concerned that the research budget would disappear. However, that has not proven to be the case and the relevant moneys are being spent on good research.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> The strategic policy division is co-ordinating the development of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 within the Department and is working with other Departments towards achieving the Government’s objective of the creation of 100,000 jobs by 2016. The division is also leading or contributing to a number of specific policy reviews and evaluations under way in the Department including enterprise policy to 2025, in growth areas of opportunity such as intellectual property management, big data and smart ageing, and to the reviews of our strategy for science, technology and innovation to 2020 and also the review of the Department's statement of strategy for the next three years. The Deputy will be aware that the science strategy document was for the period up to 2013 and it is important that we get a new strategy up and running. We are currently working on a new document in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">The Deputy will be aware that the science strategy ran its course in 2013. The strategy document is important and it is important that we get up and running in this regard. We are currently doing a lot of work on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">The Forfás website, which is full of interesting reports, directs one to the Department's website. The news releases from August on the Department's website refer to the expansion of Storyful, Danone concluding an expansion programme, the Taoiseach launching a centre, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, urging new impetus, MDS opening international offices, and Minister of State Deputy Gerald Nash making a statement. Minister of State Deputy Damien English has not quite made it. All that is missing from the Department's website are the cheerleaders and the pompoms. There is no sense of independent thinking or challenge, which was the hallmark of Forfás and the kinds of documents it produced. For instance, Forfás highlighted a 12% increase in legal fees in its last report on business costs and pushed the Government to do something about the Legal Services Regulation Bill. Nothing was done in this regard. I fear that, in the context of the cheerleading on the website, independent thinking on policy is lost.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The Minister of State, Deputy English, mentioned the enterprise strategy document published at the end of September. It is very good but its recommendations were immediately ignored by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the budget, despite the opportunities. There should be a little more independence and a little more challenge in the tradition of Forfás as opposed to what is currently on the Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I will have to review the website to make sure I am on it. I am very disappointed. There is a need for some research on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> I disagree with the Deputy. I found it useful over recent months to have the Forfás personnel as part of our team in the Department. On a weekly basis, one now has a chance to debate policy and work on solutions. I am highly involved with the staff on the skills agenda and making sure we will not be in a position in a year or two in which we will have many jobs available but no currently unemployed person from an Irish background and who is living here to fill them. The Forfás staff are part of our new policy development work and they are working very closely with us.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The other key area is the science strategy. It is important. The prioritisation agenda, involving the targeting of research and development and innovation moneys over recent years, is very important and has delivered quite a lot for this country. We must ensure the strategy develops over the coming four or five years. I disagree with the Deputy. It is important that the Forfás staff are involved. I note the Deputy's concern that there is no longer independent advice. I can assure him from dealing with the staff around the management table that they are very independent and have very strong views. They have a major role in formulating the Department's plans for budget 2015. In time, the Deputy will see that I am telling him the truth.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I welcome the fact that the personnel are challenging policy within the Department because it is a Department that needs to be challenged consistently, especially internally. However, we are not seeing that. Will we see a National Competitiveness Council report for 2015 in the same way we saw one for 2014, despite the fact that it is being ignored? Will we see the kinds of reports it produced on legal services? The Minister of State said there will be an ICT review. The Department is succumbing to cheerleading. One could never call the action plan for jobs review independent; it has never been. It is the biggest cheerleader or pompom of them all. It is basically a pat on the back for everybody, with a rating of 95%. The Department always leaves room to demonstrate independence but there is none really. It is essential that we see the independent thought published and the policy challenge available in public as opposed to within the four walls of the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">As the Deputy knows, the committee presents a great opportunity to discuss policy. There is no problem engaging regularly at its meetings on policy initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The Deputy touched on the action plan for jobs. Forfás was driving the action plan for jobs from the start. Mr. Shanahan, who has now moved to the IDA, was a key driver of the plan when he was in Forfás. Nothing has changed and the commentary will not change. What Forfás was doing in the past was gathering evidence to make policy decisions. The key people are still doing that. It is recognised that the Department - the Deputy was there himself - experienced a reduction in the number of personnel in the area of policy formulation and research. We now have a very strong unit that brings together the staff of Forfás with the staff already in the Department. From what I can see, I am happy with our daily policy decisions. We have proper information with which to make decisions. They are evidence based and not based on the whim of any Minister. The three of us here want to do the right thing. </p>
            <p eId="para_51"> The Deputy criticised the action plan for jobs. If we had not lost the whole enterprise agenda during the boom years, we would not need an action plan for jobs. The fact of the matter is that we had lost the basis of enterprise-driven economics in this country. The action plan for jobs comprises 300 or 400 actions across all Departments and it makes it very clear that it is the role of every Department to contribute to the jobs agenda. We must now refocus and in some cases go back to basics, but if the previous Government had done its job correctly we would not have to go back to basics.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">In the smaller towns in the west, such as Castlerea, Boyle, Tuam and Mohill, there does not seem to be any strategy to create employment. We are back to these obstacles being put in the way. I firmly believe that the Departments need to adopt joined-up thinking. For example, I am aware of a hotel that could have been sold and 15 jobs created but for exorbitant rates. At this stage, we need to think outside the box. No matter how one looks at it, that was worth €300,000 being taken off the social welfare bill. At the same time, we were looking at rates of €40,000 and we lost the sale of a business. Can we not do a bit of new thinking? For example-----</p>

            <p eId="para_55">The ongoing aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support enterprise growth and job creation in all regions of the country and in all towns and cities. Recent CSO data show that the number at work has increased by 33,500 in the past 12 months. Compared to a situation where the private sector was losing 7,000 jobs per month, we are now creating 2,800 jobs per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Looking at the live register, in the past 12 months 143,000 people left the live register to take up work and the nationwide Pathways to Work initiative aims to support that. In all of those regions of which the Deputy speaks, the live register figure is falling. It is falling in the Border region, the midlands and the west, and when one goes down to individual towns, it is also falling. We are making progress. The general policy has been to support business on a wide basis, with, for instance, the low rate of VAT, the abolition of the travel tax, the access to finance measures, the online trading measures, the reforms in company law and the reforms in income tax. These all are aimed at improving the business environment in towns and cities across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> As I have already said, the new structure of 31 local enterprise offices is now in place. They are aimed specifically at the smaller business start-up, to support those and act as a first-stop shop so that anyone seeking to create an enterprise in those towns the Deputy mentioned have access to a full range of supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> On top of that, this year we will introduce a regional framework for enterprise strategy in each region to try to build off the competitive advantage that those regions have. We will be looking at such matters as the community enterprise centres as an asset in those regions to see how we can we sweat to deliver better value and create new opportunities. I assure the Deputy that we are working actively to seek to create the best possible environment for towns and cities to grow and support the enterprises within them.</p>

However, the reality is each of us on the ground knows the problems involved in setting up business right across the country. We need to forget about those who love writing a beautiful essay; we need to work constructively together.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> I was in contact with three local enterprise offices, LEOs, yesterday. When I was trying to see if training or funding was available, one of them stated it had no funding left. It is grand in here for us all to say the LEOs or whatever can do this, that or the other, but the reality on the ground, which is what matters, is that the funding is not there at present and the problem will not be solved without it.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">If Deputy Fitzmaurice wants to draw to our attention a specific office where he is having difficulty, we will look at that situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> By establishing the local enterprise office, we sought to forge a partnership with the local authorities. The local authorities are one of the most powerful influences in the local area. They have access to property solutions. They provide the environment for many of the business supports, and the planning rules. They are a powerful ally.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">Through the local enterprise office, one has access to mentoring support, start-up supports and access to the Revenue Commissioners, who provide seed capital tax relief for people who were PAYE officers. A range of supports is available. If people are experiencing difficulty at local level, the Deputy should by all means draw matters to our attention and we will seek to rectify them. We are trying to ensure there is a network in place in order that anyone who wants to start a business can get access to the support mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> Microfinance is now being run through the local enterprise office and the take-up of that has doubled in the past 12 months. Some of the new initiatives that are being rolled out to new businesses are having an impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I welcome the opportunity to give the Minister this information. When I inquired about funding in a LEO office I visited yesterday, I was told that if the business is not based on exports then it is a non-runner. We need to know where we stand, and we must encourage everyone who sets up a business, whether they sell to their neighbour or to America. We must get it into people's heads that a job is a job and the enterprise offices should deal with everybody.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">There is and has always been a distinction between businesses with an export potential and businesses that provide a purely domestic service. The rationale for that is very understandable. It would be considered unfair if one is running an existing business and a Department is providing grant aid to someone down the road with whom one is in competition. However, grants are available if someone is in a business with a potential for export. Supports are also available for domestic businesses. A start-up tax credit is available, as is microfinance, mentoring and a range of other supports. Each business is judged on its own merits.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">Unemployment is a very important factor in all of our work. The economic crash saw a rise in unemployment in every region, and my Department and agencies have sought to respond to the employment challenge in every region. Since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs, approximately 70,000 extra people have got work. Enterprises in every region have increased employment and in almost all sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> The highest rate of unemployment has consistently been recorded in the south east and my Department has put a special spotlight on the region. Agencies under my Department give higher levels of aid in regions with lower average income and higher unemployment. Under our Presidency of the EU, we negotiated a revised map for regional aid which allowed Kerry, Kells, Athy and Arklow to be brought in within the framework in view of their high levels of unemployment. The capacity to draw a regional aid map is very severely constrained by the rules of the EU. It is not open to a Minister to pick a town here and a town there. They must be contiguous regions based on the so-called nomenclature of units for territorial statistics, NUTS III, designation of regions or areas contiguous to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> The creation of the LEO network is designed to provide a first-stop-shop for start-ups and existing enterprises that are in a position to create jobs. It also seeks to harness the influence and reach of local authorities in delivering a better service to businesses. New initiatives driven through this network include microfinance and the roll out of Ireland’s best young entrepreneur competition with a team of investment funds designed to find and support the best young entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> IDA Ireland has identified regions that require the additional support of property-based solutions. We put three in place this year in Waterford, Athlone and Letterkenny. We are seeking to develop a new regional enterprise strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Unemployment is at the core of what we are seeking to address. Every region has seen a reduction in unemployment. Even small areas have seen a reduction in unemployment. We continue to employ such an approach and through the measures I described in my previous reply to the Deputy, we seek to improve the way we use the assets we have to support enterprise in those regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I will address my comments to the Minister of State, Deputy English in particular. In many areas of the country, young unemployed people aged between 18 and 20 years are not in a FÁS scheme. Will the Minister consider a different approach? Anyone who is unemployed should be given a place on a scheme until he or she gets a job. Will the Minister consider this as a means of helping to build up the self-confidence of those who are unemployed? It is a matter of getting up and out in the morning and working with people. This would be for the betterment of the country.</p>

The JobsPlus scheme is aimed at young people in unemployment blackspots to give them a leg-up. The back-to-work enterprise allowance is available regardless of age. I refer to a range of initiatives from Springboard right through to training. The Minister of State, Deputy English, has responsibility for the new apprenticeship and traineeship models.

            <p eId="para_79">The Action Plan for Jobs is a multi-annual strategy initiated in 2012 to ensure a cross-Government approach to optimising the environment for enterprise, such that a net additional 100,000 jobs will be created by 2016. Good progress is being made on the implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014. Ireland's ranking in terms of competitiveness and ease of doing business continues to improve. The Central Statistics Office quarterly national household survey, as of the second quarter of 2014, shows that, seasonally adjusted, 1,906,300 people were employed, an increase of 33,500 on the previous year - approximately 2,800 jobs per month - and 68,700 from the first quarter of 2012, when the Action Plan for Jobs was launched</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> The 2014 plan contains 385 actions to be implemented in 2014 by all 16 Departments and by 46 agencies. Cumulatively to the end of the third quarter, 89% of those scheduled for delivery have been implemented. These actions cover delivery of supports for enterprise, actions to develop sectoral opportunities and measures that will strengthen the competitiveness and capacity of our economy to support job growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> A series of cross-cutting disruptive reforms is being advanced in 2014. These include critical areas where we can win a competitive edge across many sectors, including big data analytics; ICT skills; integrated licensing application service, for which I have responsibility; trading online voucher scheme; energy efficiency; national health innovation hub; entrepreneurship; winning abroad; manufacturing; and national step change. Each is well advanced in implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> Some examples of important initiatives implemented thus far in 2014 include the launch of local enterprise offices; the launch of the Ireland's best young entrepreneur programme; additional staff in the overseas offices of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland; and record levels of new investment by Enterprise Ireland and IDA enterprises. We have launched a British-Irish visa scheme for tourist and business travellers. These are examples of some of the key wins in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs. It has been a very effective process since 2012 and we are seeing the results of its success.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I am still none the wiser as to exactly what sectors these jobs are in, but I have noted the vast bulk of the Department's budget of €755 million for 2014 consists of grants, subsidies and other incentives to corporations. It is what is known as corporate welfare, where the State uses taxes collected from workers, and savings through cuts to public spending, to give hand-outs and tax incentives to big business to create jobs. In 2011 the Taoiseach stated he wanted this to be the best small country in which to do business by 2016. I have an issue with this statement because it does not imply jobs are being created for the sake of the people who will have the jobs, but that the Government is creating a climate for business people from these jobs. The philosophy is about face. It seems people are to serve the economy and private business rather than the other way around.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">To refer back to Deputy Coppinger's question, the total gross Exchequer expenditure by the Department in 2013 was €791.9 million, and 57% of this represented total capital expenditure via agencies under the Department's remit. Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and many other agencies under the aegis of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have done remarkable work in recent years in restoring Ireland's economic reputation abroad and they give excellent value for money for the taxpayer. They work enormously hard to promote Ireland abroad and work with indigenous Irish companies to create jobs. We can see that unemployment levels in the country have reduced enormously in recent years, from a high of approximately 15.2% to 11% and dropping. There are still far too many people out of work and we need to get many more people into sustainable decent jobs, and we are making considerable progress in doing so. All of the resources available to our agencies are accounted for and spent properly, and like other Government agencies, the Department's agencies have gone through a period of reform to ensure they are streamlined, slim, fit and lean and spend taxpayers' money in the appropriate way in promoting Ireland and ensuring we create the jobs we need.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">It used to be Labour Party policy to use public investment to create jobs, either directly in public services or elsewhere, but now it seems to go along with the ideology of doling out vast sums of money to small and medium enterprises and multinationals to try to get them to create jobs. TASC economist, Paul Sweeney, described the level of corporate welfare in Ireland as a very considerable level of direct and indirect State intervention constituting our industrial policy. It is very disappointing this is the direction in which the Minister of State has gone. The €64 billion bank bailout was already a hand-out to businesses on behalf of the taxpayer, but now we see a host of State agencies giving support to SMEs. A total of 80 Government business supports amounting to more than €2 billion are also available to SMEs. This policy is misdirected. The only way we will create jobs is by investing, for example in housing and house building which the Minister of State has not even mentioned in the course of his contribution, and in creating the social needs we have in society through job creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">As the Deputy knows, the target set out in the Action Plan for Jobs is to create 100,000 extra jobs by 2016. No individual targets are set, but I think the services sector would already employ about 76% of the total employment in the country. Naturally, therefore, that is a major area we will be operating in. In the manufacturing sector, there are key areas set out under food, biopharmaceuticals and medical devices where we are really trying to drive that agenda. There is a manufacturing initiative and forum as well to try to have a step-change there so we are focusing on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> In the services sector, the potential would be in tourism, software services, business services and retail. These have been identified and we put structures in place to try to assist in their development as well. It is clear that extra jobs in some of these areas both in manufacturing and in services have made a major contribution to the overall increase of 68,700 extra people at work since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> It is about trying to direct the supports to the key areas. As I said earlier, the Action Plan for Jobs is trying to bring in every Department. The Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Health, and Education and Skills all have their roles because we have to get back to creating long-term sustainable enterprise-driven jobs in services, manufacturing and medical devices. I was at a presentation on the pharmaceutical area this morning. There are key areas involved here.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> The other part of the Deputy's question related to how the innovation agenda forms part of that. I would very clearly say, having spent the past three or four months in this job as Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, skills and research, that the innovation agenda is probably driving about two thirds of the jobs growth. In many of the companies I visit I can see that the money they are investing in research, development and innovation is leading on to job creation. That has a major role to play. In the past two or three years the Government has targeted and prioritised funding on certain areas of the research and development agenda, trying to align taxpayers' money with industry in areas where Ireland can compete, excel and be a world leader. That is paying off and is leading on to jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> Deputy Coppinger wants the Government to create all the jobs. We do not believe the role of the Government is to create all the jobs. However, we should create the environment in which jobs can be created. That involves using taxpayers' money to provide supports for all sides of the business in all sectors. Two weeks ago at a science debate I listened to Deputy Coppinger's colleague saying that we should supply all the money for research and development. I have asked the same question of her colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, and I ask it of her. They do not want us to collect any money in any form of taxes or water charges and yet they want the Government to spend money in every area and be the only people spending money. We believe that to drive the economy we need to work with industry and the Action Plan for Jobs is about providing State supports and working together, with industry to target money in key areas which will lead on to job creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. How does the Minister of State respond to the claim from some quarters that the 76,000 jobs already created are not real jobs at all - that they are only part-time jobs and low-paid jobs? To what extent are the manufacturing or service sectors more appropriate to attract innovation-backed funding from the European institutions?</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:55:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_104">A key there is the Horizon 2020 agenda. The current research framework in Europe has a budget of €80 billion which we can draw down and target. The research community, the ecosystem, in Ireland has developed considerably in recent years and we are in a position to target about €1.25 billion of that. Quite a lot of that money will be targeted through the services industry but also through the manufacturing sector. The best way we can win that money is through collaboration with our higher education institutes along with industry, coming together through research centres and through SFI to drive that agenda, putting teams of people together to make proposals that will win in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> In the first year of Horizon 2020 we have been very successful. Ireland is leading the way and we are punching above our weight when it comes to winning funding from that budget and I think we will do well in that regard. However, the Deputy is right. The services sector is key for employment. For example, among Irish-owned enterprises, employment in services increased by 5,188 between over the past three years. In IDA Ireland enterprises, employment in services increased by 9,730.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> The Deputy asked about whether they were part-time or full-time jobs. They are full-time jobs; they are real jobs. One can look at the tax coming in from those jobs so they are not pretend jobs, part-time jobs or intern jobs. The majority are actually full-time new jobs. When we say 70,000, that figure is above the net losses as well. It is a great improvement.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">No. The mix-up here - it was mentioned earlier - is that much of the funding delivered through our State agencies must be for export-led products. We are not in a position to grant aid companies to compete with each other on the high streets of the domestic market. The emphasis is to target money, and especially financial supports, through Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and so on at companies that export. There is access to training, advice, business courses for all other businesses as well but the majority of grant aid would be for companies that export, and rightly so. We will only improve the financial position of the country if we export and that is what we are trying to do. An export agenda is driving that goal and we will continue to fund that as well. I think the Deputy would agree with me on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> I was heckled by the Deputy opposite who said the jobs are not there but the figures are. If she looks at the CSO figures of jobs created, she will get information on what jobs are full-time and part-time. All the information she would want is there.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I wish to assess from the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, where the Retail Consultation Forum is at. I acknowledge the work his predecessor, the former Minister of State, Deputy Perry, did in this area. The retail sector is a forgotten part of Irish business and Irish small and medium enterprises. I do not think there is any sense within Government of the crisis facing the retail sector not only from the economic downtown but also in terms of technology. I want to get a sense from the Minister of State where the consultation forum is at and whether there is any sense of urgency about this sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">I can assure the Deputy there is a sense of urgency about the position of the retail sector at present and in terms of addressing the serious issues around employment and so on in the sector. As part of this year’s Action Plan for Jobs, we have established the Retail Consultation Forum under the aegis of my Department to provide a platform for a structured engagement between the retail sector and relevant Departments and agencies. Its purpose is to allow key issues of relevance to the sector to be discussed with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by the Government or by the industry to support the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> The Retail Consultation Forum comprises representatives from the retail sector and from relevant public sector bodies and it comprises not necessarily only the statutory actors in the sector but individual retailers who have displayed excellence in their own areas in recent years. It is chaired by me and the secretariat to the forum is resourced by the Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_118"> The forum has met on three occasions to date this year, in June under the former Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and in September and early November when it was chaired by myself. We have agreed a broad work programme for the next 12 months. Following the September meeting of the forum, a submission was made to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform outlining proposals for consideration to support the retail sector in budget 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> One of the main challenges for the retail sector during the recession was the erosion of consumers’ disposable income. The 2015 budget was the first in many years that will herald an increase in people’s disposable incomes when people consider the tax cuts they will receive in their pay packets at the end of January and rises in social welfare payments in terms of the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus and other measures such as the €5 increase in child benefit. Other budget measures that will have a positive impact on the retail sector include the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the extension of the home renovation incentive to include rental properties, and the additional funding being provided by the Department of Social Protection under the JobsPlus scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> The most recent meeting of the forum, on 10 November, centred on identifying potential actions for inclusion in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs to support the retail sector, including areas where business costs could be addressed. In next year's Action Plan for Jobs we want to focus on the ease of doing business. On the basis of that discussion, my officials are currently drawing up a number of measures with me to support the sector and they will be considered for inclusion in next year’s Action Plan for Jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> The Deputy will be aware from having been involved in this that we anxiously await the joint Oireachtas committee's report on town centre shopping. I look forward to working with him on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">I am glad the Minister of State is anxiously awaiting that report and I hope he will be as anxious to act on it. In fairness to the Minister of State, he contributed a good deal to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">Every sector of the economy may benefit from the miserly increases given but by the time water charges are paid for there will not be much left.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> On the retail sector, how much additional funding was provided in the budget to the trading online scheme to assist retailers in moving their businesses online, which is biggest challenge facing retailers now? I understand it is a Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources allocation but presumably the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is also involved. </p>
            <p eId="para_125"> What proposals has the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation made to the Department of Finance around legacy debt? There is a need for a conversation with the Department of Finance about the many retail businesses which while operating well on a day-to-day basis are hamstrung by investments in expansion and the creation of new jobs or are facing closure by the banks because they are unable to service debt which dates back many years. There is no sense of any type of package being put in place to assist such businesses. Has there been any discussion in this regard? </p>
            <p eId="para_126"> Also, has there been any discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on its new rates revaluation Bill, which is causing chaos around the country? I would encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, when he next visits Waterford to meet with the retail groups there in regard to what rates revaluation is doing to them. It is destroying those who have invested in their properties.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">In regard to Waterford, I am looking forward to visiting the city and county earlier in the New Year with my colleague, Deputy Ciara Conway. During my visits to all areas across the country I will be meeting with retailers. I have a particular interest in trying to support the retail sector given the experience it has had over the past few years. Tomorrow, I will be visiting Carlow and some exemplars in the field of retail to discuss their concerns in regard to how Government and other agencies can support the retail sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> Some 50,000 jobs were lost in the retail sector between 2008 and 2012. Approximately 10% of our workforce is employed in retail across every town, village and city in this country. I know I speak for every Deputy in this House and for every Member of the Oireachtas when I express concern for the retail sector. Key to supporting retail is ensuring consumers have confidence and adequate disposable income to spend. </p>
            <p eId="para_129"> In regard to the online trading scheme, the amount of resources available for the scheme this year has been doubled because, as the Deputy will be aware, there is enormous leakage to other markets. I am aware of the Deputy's concern in this matter. We are acting on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">I welcome the doubling of the funding. It is important the message in that regard gets out. Perhaps the LEOs can step up to the mark in this regard. The Minister of State referred earlier to confidence. Many retailers need confidence to enable them trade online. They do not understand the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> Where are we at on the legacy debt issue, which is a major issue, in particular for retailers who may have expanded their premises or bought new premises during the so-called boom time? There is a great deal of focus on mortgage debt, and rightly so, but SME debt is costing jobs and expansion. Without some real attempt to focus on this, it will be a drag on economic recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">The issue of restructuring of debt is one I raise continually with senior banking officials when I have the opportunity to meet with them. As I understand it, Bank of Ireland has restructured 90% of the debt over-hangs to which the Deputy referred, which are obviously not exclusively in the retail sector but across the SME sector. Considerable further work needs to be done. We have travelled some journey over the past year or two in terms of dealing with the issues that can place a heavy burden on businesses that in terms of their core business are very sustainable but where because of property debt difficulties may arise. There is more work to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_133"> Later today I will be meeting with senior executives from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI. I am looking forward to ensuring that this institution does step up to the mark and that people are aware that it will shortly be open for business so that retailers can access the various products for which it will be responsible. I believe this will be a very important dimension in the market.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">I thank the Deputy for the question. The Construction Contracts Act 2013 seeks to ensure prompt payment practices throughout the construction industry which, as we are all aware, has suffered markedly throughout the economic downturn. It is intended that the legislation will provide easier access to payment for contractors who have carried out work, thus ensuring that those contractors who have endured hard times do not see such problems exacerbated by the holding up of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_137"> The commencement of the Act is dependent on a number of factors contained within the Act itself. These include the appointment of a chairperson and panel of adjudicators by the Minister who must be highly qualified and suitable to ensure quality outcomes in disputes referred under the Act. It requires the drafting and publication of a code of practice for the conduct of adjudications, which will be binding on all adjudicators operating under the Act, not just those appointed to cases by the chair of the adjudication panel.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> Work on these items and the required consultation with industry has been and is ongoing. My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service to develop the parameters for an open competition for those who may want to apply for a place on the panel of adjudicators, and a draft version of the code of practice has been prepared in consultation with industry which I hope will be finalised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> It is expected that the Act will be implemented in full by spring 2015. A specific date of implementation for the Act and details of the various stages leading up to that implementation will be announced in advance once those details have been finalised to provide sufficient notice to those affected by the Act's provisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">Before the legislation was brought into play, there was a wide-ranging consultation process. This consultation process is ongoing after the legislation has been passed and I cannot understand the need for it. The Government knew what was involved in regard to the legislation but it appears no preparatory work has been done. It seems likely it will take the full length of time this Administration is in office to get very important subcontracting legislation through. My previous question was also about subcontracting. The subcontracting area is in crisis and it is a mess both for subcontractors and workers working in the area. I cannot understand, therefore, why it is taking the Government so long to implement this vital legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">I recently took on responsibility for this legislation and for setting up the infrastructure around it. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was responsible for it previously but it was no longer appropriate for that Department to be responsible for it. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was particularly anxious that this process would be expedited and I actively sought responsibility for this legislation and its operation. I accept and understand what Deputy Tóibín has said. This is very important for the construction industry and it is something which the Construction Industry Federation has been seeking for some time, as have some subcontractors across that sector of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> I assure the Deputy that there will not be any undue delay in regard to the appointment of those who need to be appointed because it is important we get this legislation operational very soon. I accept what the Deputy said that people have waited an excessively long time for this particular body to be up and running. I will not delay any further nor will I waste any time making sure it is up and running very shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">This question relates to the case where a civil servant in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation submitted a witness statement to the Minister which was sought by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation two years ago but which remained on a desk in the Department until recent weeks. It has led me to a query in regard to the resourcing of the Department itself. Will the Minister provide details on what resources were amiss in the Department which led to this vital issue not being dealt with for more than two years?</p>

            <p eId="para_145">This is not the question the Deputy asked. He asked for a tabular statement containing the number of civil servants employed in the Department. There were 1,021 employed in 2007, 1,075 in 2008, 994 in 2009, 906 in 2010, 831 in 2011, 788 in 2012, 802 in 2013 and 803 as of today. Those figures reflect changes in responsibility as well as the effect of the employment control framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> The position in regard to the matter the Deputy raised is that this was an investigation under the Companies Act, initiated back in 1998. All of the files gathered in that investigation were provided to all of the relevant authorities, including the Revenue Commissioners, the tribunals, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and various relevant bodies which had the power to investigate that issue. Arising from that, the officer concerned drew up a witness statement which I decided should be issued and be duly checked before it would be issued, as was required under the Companies Act. The checking of that took longer than expected but that matter was dealt with when the outstanding period was identified, and it has been furnished to the relevant authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">The reason I asked about resources was that we were led to believe that resources were a major reason this took so long. Mr. Ryan sent the Minister the statement via an assistant secretary in December 2012. When no action followed, he wrote to the Minister again in 2012 to complain that he had not forwarded this statement to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, as required of him. It was reported that his correspondence also emphasised the importance of the statement which he believed carried substantial evidence supporting allegations of a conspiracy to defraud the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> In anybody's mind, this is a very serious issue and one which would be a priority for a Minister to deal with, and a priority so strong as to allocate the necessary resources to deal with it. Another year passed and the Minister's office still had not dealt with Mr. Ryan's statement and he clearly had no option but to bring the issue to the Committee of Public Accounts. Mr. Ryan's statement had also been sought by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. It is incredible that a resource issue is the basis of a two-year delay in regard to this important detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">I assure the Deputy that all of the evidence of alleged tax evasion went to the various authorities, including the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners issued a statement outlining the investigation they undertook in respect of various individuals under the Ansbacher accounts. They also went to the Garda, which issued a statement that it has dealt with these issues and a file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I assure the Deputy that the issues have been thoroughly passed on in every detail to the various authorities in a position to take enforcement action. Both of the authorities have reported that action has been taken in respect of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I remember three or four years ago, the Taoiseach spoke in very convincing terms about dramatically reforming the health service, money following the patient, the Dutch model and the fact that everybody would be treated on time and nobody would have to wait ever again. The figures published last Friday tell a different story. One in every eight patients on a hospital waiting list is in the queue for more than one year. That is 50,000 on an outpatient waiting list for more than one year, which is a 400% increase from January to now. In Tallaght hospital alone, close to 7,000 patients have been waiting for more than one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">In Waterford there are 6,342 waiting. The figures are bad elsewhere, with more 4,500 waiting in Galway and so forth. A total of 46,000 people have been waiting more than eight months for a hospital appointment. The Government set the eight month target, which is higher than previous ones. On the inpatient waiting lists the numbers have soared from 1,764 to approximately 9,693 in about seven months, that is an increase of 450%. There are approximately 5,000 children on an inpatient waiting list, approximately 2,000 of whom have been waiting for longer than 20 weeks, which was the target the Government set.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, had set a target of three months for children and six months for adults and had broadly achieved those targets across most disciplines where people required elective surgery. The former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, changed those targets arbitrarily. He got rid of the NTPF and there have been dishonest and flawed budgets since. In last year’s budget €200 million was taken from hospitals. There has been appalling mismanagement and there are over 200 vacancies for consultants. The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, is saying it will get worse before it gets better. How much worse will it get for children and adults having to wait for hospital treatment? Does the Taoiseach accept that the commitments he personally gave three or four years ago on waiting times and lists are simply in tatters and that urgent intervention is required to turn this around?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">The Deputy spoke fairly convincingly a few years ago when he said he would end waiting lists permanently. He made great play of it and subsequently accepted no responsibility for anything that happened in the Department of Health. In 2007 there were just over 6,200 on the inpatient and day care waiting lists for over 12 months. While it is nothing great to shout about, this year the number is down to 1,800 waiting longer than 12 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">While we cannot be happy about not meeting all the targets for children it does mean that four out of five people are receiving treatment within target times. This morning the Government approved the draft service plan submitted by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to the Minister for Health. The Deputy is aware that over €600 million has been allocated for health for 2015. There was an overrun of €510 million which will allow for some changes to be made. In September of this year the number of patients waiting in excess of 12 months for an outpatient appointment decreased from 84,167 to 41,604, a reduction of 51% when compared with the same period in 2013. Up to the end of September this year there was a 3% increase in outpatient attendances compared with 2013. That is 64,289 more patients actually seen despite the fact that expenditure in the health service has gone from €16 billion to €13 billion. Although the increased provision and uptake of outpatient appointments is positive that will result in some additional demand for inpatient and day cases. In primary care, waiting times for physiotherapists and occupational therapists has decreased and there has been an improvement in the end of life care and the childhood health surveillance.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Deputy Martin can see where the demand is coming from. In the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period in 2013, the new emergency department attendances were up by 3.5%, and admissions were up 2% including a 13% rise in overnight admissions through the acute medical assessment unit, AMAU, system. Outpatient attendances were up 3.8% as part of the outpatient waiting list initiative, facilitated in part through appointments during additional working hours. That will have an effect on elective waiting lists. These things are never as one would want them to be. I cannot project the numbers for the future, except that the changes to be made following the approval of the HSE plan by the Government this morning will have an impact on the health service in general. </p>

          <p eId="para_174">The Taoiseach knows that. That is why he got rid of Deputy Reilly as Minister for Health. The thing was a mess. It was in tatters. All I said at the outset was that the number of adults waiting for more than eight months went from 1,700 to 9,693 in adult inpatients alone. That was the target the Government imposed, although the original target was six months and the NTPF was meeting it the Government got rid of it. The same applies to children, 37% are waiting longer than the target the Government set. The real reason for that is the Government starved the Department of Health last year and brought in a false budget. I am not allowed to use the words “a lie” here but a lot of porkies about the health budget were told to Deputies 12 months ago. That is why hospitals whose budgets were cut by €200 million could not meet the impossible targets the Government set them because it starved them of funds. The Government mismanaged the consultant situation with the result that there is a serious number of vacancies across the country, in the Mater, Tallaght and elsewhere because of the mess it made of the appointments. In the health service plan the Government has just approved will that €200 million taken from acute hospital budgets last year be restored? Yes or no?</p>

          <p eId="para_191">From the outset Uisce Éireann, Irish Water has reeked of cronyism, jobs for the boys and reckless waste of public money, not least the €86 million spent on consultants. That has been a hallmark of the company. Would the Taoiseach not accept that this is a toxic brand and that the majority of citizens will not accept it?</p>
          <p eId="para_192">It has also emerged that in May 2013, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government had an understanding that the overall budget for the installation of water meters would amount to €431 million. Instead, that has come out at €539 million, which is €100 million more than the Government budgeted for. I am sure the Taoiseach can count up that. This is a huge amount of the people's money. The CEO, Michael McNicholas, has explained this away by blaming water meter contractors. This is very interesting, given that the same Mr. McNicholas owns shares worth €1 million in a company, NTR plc - formerly National Toll Roads - which is making millions out of water meter contracts. Mr. McNicholas is also an adviser to NTR plc. Will the Taoiseach explain the massive overrun for the installation of water meters? Will he tell the Dáil whether he thinks it is satisfactory that the man who heads up Irish Water's parent company owns significant shares in a company that is set to make millions from Irish Water contracts?</p>

          <p eId="para_206">The Taoiseach said he could not speak for Mr. McNicholas. I did not ask him to speak for Mr. McNicholas. I asked the Taoiseach to say whether he thinks it is satisfactory that the man who heads up Irish Water's parent company owns significant shares in a company that is set to make millions from Irish Water contracts. It is very simple. Does the Taoiseach accept that this is a satisfactory situation? He may also know that more than 17,000 people who returned their packs to Irish Water did so without filling them in. That was an act of peaceful and democratic protest by them against water charges. It is part of a real democratic revolution. They made it clear that they did not want to be customers of Irish Water, but Irish Water signed them up against their will in an act of extreme arrogance that was characteristic of this Government and of the company. Can the Taoiseach tell us whether the behaviour of a man who has a huge number of shares, worth €1 million, and is set to earn money from this whole project is appropriate and satisfactory? Does he believe that Irish Water's appropriation of the names and addresses of citizens who are clearly opposed to water charges, in order to sign them up for water charges, is legitimate or fair? Would it even stand up to Irish contract law?</p>

          <p eId="para_236">Last October, Pobal published on its website details of the funding that was available in different lots under the social inclusion and community activation programmes. It seemed that the level of cuts being proposed was 10% in rural areas, 20% in urban areas and 38% in areas of inner-city Dublin. This 38% cut will affect communities of extreme deprivation, which have rates of unemployment much higher than the national average, high numbers of lone families and issues presented by the new communities. I am talking about areas of greater disadvantage than other parts of the country. Even though progress is being made with educational attainment, progression to third level in these areas is much lower than in the rest of the country. These areas have lost the public private partnerships and the regeneration it was hoped would result from such partnerships. This 38% cut will affect community organisations that are offering community training and education, working with lone-parent families, providing affordable child care and working with people in addiction. I will give an example of the new realities with which these organisations are dealing. A cheap synthetic drug known as ice that came on the market recently has led to a number of deaths. The community organisations are responding to those issues as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> For some reason, the Government has decided to go ahead with private procurement of the social inclusion programmes. This could have devastating effects because of the loss of expertise and experience. The 38% cut I have mentioned will be also devastating. I would like to mention a particular statistic that has been highlighted by these groups. They have said that more than 2,500 people - long-term unemployed adults, vulnerable adults, lone parents and those in recovery - could be affected by service changes in the areas of adult education and training and pre-employment support. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has committed to the retention of community services through the social inclusion community activation programme with a loss of €1.7 million. When it is added up, it seems to be nearer to €9 million. The groups were promised that they would see the rationale allocation model. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that will happen. How can these community organisations proceed and make progress if they are to face cuts of 38%?</p>

          <p eId="para_239">The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is aware of the issue the Deputy has raised. He has undertaken to examine the funding of community organisations and entities like those mentioned by the Deputy. It is often necessary to draw funding from various State agencies for these kinds of communities or organisations. As the Deputy knows, a Private Members' motion on the question of social inclusion has been tabled today. I think the Department of Social Protection has worked very hard at that over the years. I refer to the different facilities, contributions and opportunities it has put together.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I would point out to the Deputy as well that the new board of SOLAS, in giving its remuneration to replace FÁS, has a remit to have a link between education and job opportunities.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that the participation in third level institutions from areas of deprivation or areas that are certainly socially challenged has been very low. We have tried to encourage third level institutions to make a particular effort so that young people would have the opportunity to go to third level, though the difficulties that they have encountered have been exceptional at second level. It is an issue that I expect that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will probably address in the course of the Private Members' discussions this evening and tomorrow. I will bring the Deputy's personal observations to his attention myself.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I am struck by a couple of ironies. One is that the social inclusion programme is targeting those in society with whom these community organisations are working. When I was in the GPO for the launch of the 1916 commemoration programme, I was also struck by how it was not a stone's throw from some of the really disadvantaged communities. If the Rising was about anything, it was about equality.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">However, this is not equality. It is also not an issue that is confined to Dublin. Last week, I attended a meeting for the non-Gaeltacht island communities. Their community development programme is facing what will almost be a complete axing, undermining their front-line services. Deputy Halligan has just told me about a child care centre in a RAPID area in Waterford that provides low-cost child care for more than 100 children. Fourteen of its employees are on protective notice. Seemingly, there is a similar case in Sligo. While I am particularly concerned with Dublin, this issue arises elsewhere. It is causing the organisations in question a great deal of stress and distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is holding a number of meetings. For example, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, will meet him and the Lord Mayor of Dublin has stated that he will be meeting him. However, it is more important that the Minister meet the community organisations that are on the front line of these cuts.</p>

Obviously, island communities have had a particular priority over the years. There is a €2.2 billion fund for rural development between 2014 and 2020 that covers a lot of the areas and the different organisations out there.</p>

            <p eId="para_301">Please, Deputies. The Taoiseach is answering questions.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_200">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_302">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 21, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> These questions relate to the Cabinet committee dealing with climate change and my attendance at the climate change summit hosted by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in New York in September. I have been asked about meetings of the Cabinet committee dealing with climate change. The most recent meeting took place on 11 November. This was the second meeting of the newly constituted Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure and climate change, which will ensure that discussion of the climate change agenda is fully integrated into broader discussions on economic infrastructure. The next meeting of this committee will be scheduled as required. In the meantime, senior officials from relevant Departments continue to meet on a regular basis to deal with climate change issues. The issues are also dealt with, when appropriate, at the Cabinet committee on European Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> I have also been asked a series of questions concerning my attendance at the UN summit on climate change on 23 September last. I attended this summit at the invitation of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who hosted the event at the UN headquarters in New York. The summit was convened in an effort to add political momentum to ongoing negotiations to have a binding global climate change agreement. It is hoped that agreement on a deal will be reached by the end of 2015 when Heads of State and Government are due to meet in Paris under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The summit in New York was an important stepping stone towards next year's UN conference in Paris. Representatives of almost 170 nations attended the event, making it the largest gathering of Heads of State and Government to discuss climate change issues since the 2009 UN conference in Copenhagen.</p>
            <p eId="para_305"> During my address to the plenary session, I emphasised the need for progress towards a globally binding agreement and called on other nations to step up to the plate in dealing with the challenges posed by climate change. The global community cannot afford another failed set of negotiations, as happened in 2009 at the Copenhagen conference. I indicated that Ireland supported the EU objective of bringing forward our contribution to a global climate deal by the first quarter of 2015 at the latest.</p>
            <p eId="para_306"> In my address, which had input from a range of Departments before I finalised it, I highlighted areas where Ireland was making significant progress in addressing the climate change challenge. This includes our world class performance in regard to carbon efficient agriculture and food production; our implementation of a range of carbon pricing instruments, including a carbon tax; our long-term policy objectives to support the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy; and our intention to enact climate legislation in the near future. I also highlighted Ireland's strong contribution to aiding the climate mitigation and adaptation efforts of other countries, particularly through our contributions to fast start climate finance and to supporting the climate justice agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_307"> I attended both the opening session and the plenary session of the summit. I did not have any side meeting. Deputies will be aware that the former President of Ireland, Ms Mary Robinson, was appointed earlier this year by UN Secretary General Ban as his Special Envoy for Climate Change. She played a pivotal role in ensuring the success of the climate change summit in New York. While I did not meet the former President on the day of the summit itself, I did have a very useful meeting with her here in Ireland before I departed for New York. Mary Robinson is an internationally respected figure whose foundation does tremendous work in addressing the climate change challenge, and particularly the important issue of climate justice. In her latest role as Special Envoy for Climate Change, she helped ensure that world leaders joined the summit in a very significant way and numbers, and added to the awareness of the need to achieve a global agreement by the end of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> Notwithstanding our constrained investment capacity, Ireland is playing its part in relation to this important challenge, like increasing levels of renewable energy and addressing emissions from agriculture while at the same time maintaining our commitment to meeting global nutrition and food security objectives in a carbon-efficient manner. We continue to work closely with other member states and the European Commission to devise ways to improve continuously the level of carbon efficiency in our agriculture sector. Now, we have signalled our interest in the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture and look forward to working with partner countries outside the EU to advance further our understanding of how to produce food for a global population while at the same time maximising our contribution to the global effort on climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_309">Within the European Union, Ireland is making a strong contribution to the overall effort despite an extremely challenging set of 2020 targets compounded by the impact of the economic crisis since those targets were set. While the Government supports the principle of an ambitious contribution by the European Union for 2030, it is determined to ensure the sharing of that contribution across the European Union's member states is fair and recognises Ireland's specific challenges and specific circumstances. This means taking proper account of Ireland's agricultural sector, which already is highly carbon-efficient, as well as recognising the severe limitations on capital investment over a number of years arising from the fiscal crisis and the constraints of Ireland's EU-IMF programme. At the European Council last month, I emphasised these concerns strongly and am satisfied we are making progress in what will continue to be challenging negotiations in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_310"> I also indicated Ireland's support for a number of important international initiatives on climate change. These include a World Bank statement on carbon pricing, the phasing down of climate potent hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, and the global green freight action plan. I also signalled Ireland's interests in a new initiative on climate-smart agriculture. These are just the latest of a number of examples in which Ireland is working closely with its counterparts within the European Union and internationally to deal with the climate change challenge.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_201">
            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_311">In his address to the United Nations climate change meeting in September, the Taoiseach spoke about the need for a collective global response and about the need for corporations to take responsibility, to define objectives and to take action. He also spoke about the need for sustainability. The Taoiseach is correct that a global response is needed urgently considering the imminent threat of rapid rises in global warming rates, the huge environmental damage to ecosystems this will do and the huge impact it can have on weather patterns, sea levels and so on, which can have devastating effects on coastal communities, many of which are in a highly vulnerable condition. In respect of this critical issue of climate change, did or does the Taoiseach reflect at all on the fundamental conflict that exists between a world economic system that on the one hand is driven by powerful corporations with the maximisation of private profit and super-profits as their key aim and how on the other hand, this threatens the climate by virtue of the cost-cutting emissions put in by those corporations and their disregard for the vulnerability, needs and horrific poverty of hundreds of millions of people?</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> Is the Taoiseach aware of the world-famous Canadian author and activist, Naomi Klein, and her recently published book on climate change and its catastrophic effects, <i>This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs The Climate</i>? She states the world has not "done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because these things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism", which is the reigning ideology. She states further that greed, "fully liberated by lax regulation and monitoring", is hugely at the source of the types of pollution and emissions that cause global warming. Is the Taoiseach aware of the report some time ago in the journal, <i>Climatic Change</i>, which stated that a mere 90 companies worldwide have produced 63% of the accumulated global emissions of industrial carbon dioxide and methane between 1751 and 2010? Moreover, it states that nearly 30% of those emissions were belched out by the top 20 companies and that half of the estimated emissions occurred in the past 25 years. Is this not a really alarming picture regarding the causes of climate change?</p>
            <p eId="para_313"> How does the Taoiseach envisage this issue being resolved worldwide when one has this fundamental conflict between what is causing change and the fact that governments in Europe and all over the world are in the pockets of those same corporations, if not corruptly then through ideologically sharing the same ideas? In addition, as can be seen in Europe for example, there is the huge lobbying power of these massive corporations, which have ready access to the European Commission and to Ministers and Prime Ministers from every Government throughout the European Union. What hope is there of a radical challenge to the activities of these corporations and the profit maximisation that is militating against serious measures being taken to cut emissions radically in the interests of humanity and of the future of our environment and ecosystems?</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> Does it not make a mockery of ordinary people throughout the world how even climate change is being turned into yet another type of global market situation in which the emissions trading scheme essentially has major corporations buying the right to pollute? Is this not quite an obscene development? What is the Taoiseach's view in this regard? What practical steps does the Taoiseach believe should be taken and spelled out to people here and internationally to challenge this established situation which, unless it is challenged and changed, will continue to wreak further havoc?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_315">I thank Deputy Higgins for his comments and broad analysis of the challenges we face. At European level, Ireland obviously participates in the general consensus that one must take political action in this regard to meet the targets that have been set out. However, the Government also is conscious that Ireland has arrived at a position in which its agrisector is highly energy and carbon-efficient at present. As quotas go in 2015, it will lead to a situation in which one can increase substantially the output, particularly from the dairy sector, in an area in which it is known that Ireland is one of the few countries in the world to be leading in terms of the carbon footprint of the agrisector. While Ireland has been constrained for many years by virtue of the quota system being in existence, a freedom now is building up that is evident in the transactions of land and the preparation for the opportunity, especially for young farmers, in the agrisector where they see these opportunities piling up. This is tempered on the other side by the fact it is extremely difficult to get agreement on some of these areas, given our position as a member state of the European Union and the targets that were set for us for 2020. The purpose of the last European Council meeting was to set out targets for 2020 to 2030 and there will be no hope in high heaven of Ireland being able to reach those targets. It will be exceptionally difficult for us to achieve the targets set by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_316">Those targets were set on the basis of different kinds of evidence drawn from various sources of scientific analyses. The country was left in a position where it would not be able to meet such targets. The conclusion of the European Council was to support Ireland's particular profile, which is very similar to that of New Zealand in the context of agri-output, and to create a situation whereby afforestation and sequestration will allow for a recognition in respect of that element of the target which we must achieve between 2020 and 2030.</p>
            <p eId="para_317"> With regard to what action is going to be taken, at the European Council meeting there was a genuine response from the 28 member states to the effect that this matter should be able to be dealt with in a global context at the Paris conference next year. In that regard, intensive rounds of discussion and negotiation will begin in the new year. That to which the Deputy referred is already having an impact, particularly in terms of the analysis the OPW is being obliged to carry out in respect of flood defences in Cork, Galway and Dublin and at many other locations throughout the country. During our lifetime, weather patterns have changed significantly and we have witnessed the havoc which massive tides backed by storm-force winds can wreak on the economies of many of our towns and cities. One need only consider the impact of last year's floods in order to obtain evidence in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_318"> The fifth and final report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, which concluded what the panel terms the "fifth assessment", brought together the key findings - involving thousands of inputs - issued by all the major working groups in the past 14 months. The IPCC's report is valuable in the context of facilitating sound decision making and the development of science-based policy at all levels and it provides the evidence base on which the work being carried out nationally and internationally rests. Its publication was timely, especially as we begin the process which will lead us towards the conference to be held in Paris at the end of 2015. As Deputy Higgins is aware, this the strongest and clearest report issued by the IPCC. It reiterates the warning that climate change is unequivocal, that the human influence is clear and that climate change is having widespread impacts on human and natural systems on all continents and across all oceans. Of course, some parts of the globe have been much more adversely affected than others.</p>
            <p eId="para_319"> The combined findings of the report are striking. They indicate a clear rise in average global temperatures by almost 1° Celsius since the 1880s and project a further increase in the coming decades. According to the report, the widespread loss of ice sheets in the Arctic Ocean will result in a rise in sea levels and changes in rainfall patterns. The latter would both be major concerns for Ireland, particularly as they are expected to result in much more intense rainfall and an increased risk of flooding. We have had some evidence of this in the past couple of years. The report is also clear on the consequences of inaction. Even with adaptation, the continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. One such impact would be in the context of food production.</p>
            <p eId="para_320"> Crucially, however, the report highlights the actions we can take. It notes that substantial near-terms emission reductions can reduce risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation and contribute to climate-resilient pathways which can lead to sustainable development in different countries. It is in that context that work is under way to draw up a national low-carbon development plan - which will be underpinned by legislation - to ensure maximum certainty for the future. Through Irish Aid, this country is helping developing countries to adapt to climate change. At home, work is under way on the sectoral adaptation plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_321"> The IPCC report also notes that the problem of climate change is a global issue and that it, therefore, demands a collective response. At EU level and in participation with all countries involved with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, Ireland is assisting in working towards a new global agreement in respect of this matter. I listened to quite a number of the speakers who addressed the UN climate change summit and while many delivered set-piece speeches, it was obvious that there is a very strong consensus to the effect that it will not be possible to deal with this problem unless all the big nations - including the major players in the Far East and the United States - are involved. Whereas Europe, as one of the older groupings of developed nations, has been leading the way in terms of climate change, there is no doubt that much more needs to be done and that a global response is required. There would be no point in putting some countries to the pin of their collar in the context of achieving targets to keep carbon emissions down while other nations are not participating. The effect of the statements made by the UN Secretary General and the major global players was to highlight the absolute necessity of full participation by all nations across the globe.</p>
            <p eId="para_322"> Ireland supports a number of initiatives, including that which relates to climate-smart agriculture. We have already indicated our agreement in respect of initiatives in a number of other areas and we will work towards taking action on these. Food security and food shortages are global issues. We are of the view that we can continue to produce food of a much higher integrity and standard - while ensuring that we keep the situation with regard to our carbon footprint in check - than that produced in countries which do not have in place regimes to control carbon emissions. We see this as part of the European Union response and we will play our part in respect of it. While the targets we were set for 2020 were both challenging and unachievable, we are not without ambition - particularly in light of the footprinting system we have developed for the agri-sector - with regard to we can achieve between 2020 and 2030.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_203">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_323">I wish to ask approximately five or six questions on this matter. The Taoiseach referred to the International Panel on Climate Change but the Government has essentially taken a step backward in the context of climate change. It has been talking a good game at the United Nations but in reality the issue of climate change has been removed from the domestic debate. That is in stark contrast to the position which obtained in the years prior to the Government entering office. Basically, it has adopted a policy of actively stepping back from taking assertive action since 2011. The former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Commissioner Phil Hogan, was probably of the view that even discussing climate change would have negative electoral consequences. That is something I have noticed in the context of a lack of debate or discussion on climate change. There is no sense that the alarm expressed in the international panel's fifth report has had an impact in Ireland. There is no indication that the catastrophic impacts which will result from climate change, as it unfolds, have entered public discourse here.</p>
            <p eId="para_324"> Prior to this Government coming to power, Ireland was very active in respect of matters relating to climate change. A broad series of policies were announced and implemented. I refer, in particular, to that which related to seeking an advantage in the context of creating green economy jobs. On reading the speech the Taoiseach delivered to the UN in New York, one might actually believe that he is engaged with regard to this matter and that his Government is highly active in respect of it. The Taoiseach called on his fellow leaders to show conviction, clarity, courage and consistency. Is he of the view that he has shown such conviction, clarity, courage or consistency? In some respects the Taoiseach's speech was cynical in nature. For example, he claimed credit - fair enough - in respect of initiatives which predated his arrival in office. He has not acknowledged this but, in effect, that is what he did. To some extent the claims he made camouflaged the Government's decision to - in terms of the domestic agenda - downgrade climate change since it came to office. In this context, I refer to the fact that initiatives relating to the provision of fast-start finance in respect of clean energy and carbon pricing instruments predate the Government's entry into office and that the concept of developing a green IFSC in order to make Ireland a world leader in supporting the financing of carbon reduction technology was championed by the Taoiseach's predecessor.</p>
            <p eId="para_325">I ask the Taoiseach to instruct his legacy-focused Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come up with some real medium-term objectives and policies on climate change. The draft legislation published by the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, in early 2013 is more regressive than anything that was produced before. If one contrasts the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Bill of 2010, the Labour Party Bill of 2009 and the all-party Bill with those produced by the current Government, one will see a stark difference, particularly considering that there is a lack of any strategic targets for 2050, for example. I do not know why the Labour Party saw fit to acquiesce in all of this and broke its promise to legislate for the goals it included in its legislation in 2009. That party has now settled for flawed, emasculated legislation, but that is a matter for it. The Bill has been roundly criticised by many environmental organisations and groups for its lack of vision and a meaningful strategic framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> Deputy Higgins has said deregulated capitalism is the great enemy of action on climate change. I do not necessarily agree with that in the sense that there will always be a will to survive and to do what makes sense economically eventually. I accept that short-term greed can and is clearly getting in the way of meaningful international and global action but, notwithstanding that, there has been a change at European level. Germany's decision to have nuclear-free energy production means it is moving back towards coal production. It is actually encouraging others, including multinationals and other big companies, to start expanding coal production to fuel its economy. It is approaching a crisis in terms of where it will get its energy. It is the bigger states that have taken a decision to be less ambitions in terms of the targets at European level. That is a fact with regard to renewables also. I refer to the scaling down of what were ambitious targets in regard to renewable energy. </p>
            <p eId="para_327"> The two countries that stand out in terms of having taken a proactive decision to do something about this were the United Kingdom, under Mr. Tony Blair and Mr. Gordon Brown, and Denmark. The United Kingdom saw that climate change could have an economic dividend because of innovations, new technologies and the development of alternative industries right across the board. In Denmark, an industry was made out of renewables and employed up to 30,000 to 40,000 because of targeting 15 to 20 years ago. Denmark would say that it was in the 1970s that it decided to become fossil fuel free. First it got rid of imports and then developed its own oil and gas industry, which will be eliminated by 2050. It has a clear, strategic plan in this regard but we do not have such a plan anymore. I do not get any sense from the Government that it is clear about what it wants to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_328"> Consider the transport sector. We talk a lot about agriculture and food, on which we are in agreement. We have long been considering forests as comprising a carbon sink that should mitigate against losses. Transport, however, is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. I do not seen any major initiatives emerging from the Government in regard to the transport sector that could reduce our carbon emissions. What is planned for the transport sector in respect of the climate change agenda? We need to play our part but we can do so in a constructive and productive way that could actually yield jobs in the future and that need not undermine economic growth or recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_329">The point is that there is a difference between targets and principle. One could set targets that might not be completely realistic for the period from now until 2050 and probably find oneself in the courts most of the time over not being able to achieve them. One must have the discussions and negotiate to determine what realistic targets could be achieved, accepting that we have to and want to participate, and that we want to be ambitious about what we are doing. The fact of the matter is that the targets set for 2020 have proven to be completely unrealistic. Ireland was actually given the highest greenhouse gas reduction target of all the member states, a target of -20%. Who sat down and negotiated that? On what basis was a target negotiated that was utterly unrealistic? Deputy Martin knows that the fines that will apply from 2020 to 2030 are enormous. The sacrifices people have made here over recent years to put our economy in a sustainable position will be wiped out by a series of enormous fines because targets have not been achieved. Can somebody explain to me the basis on which this country was given the highest greenhouse gas reduction target of all the member states, -20%? This target was completely problematic and unrealistic, and it was even more severely compounded by the unprecedented economic catastrophe our people had to face here. The catastrophe led to a decade of delayed progress on the challenge of mitigation; that is a fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> The extent of the challenge posed by 2020 is very well understood by the Government, and it is reflected in the national policy position on climate change and low carbon development and the general scheme of the climate action and low carbon development Bill, both of which were published this year. Notwithstanding the difficulties, we are still performing well regarding the big challenges here by increasing levels of renewable energy. We are addressing emissions from agriculture in a more carbon-efficient way, while at the same time maintaining our commitment to meeting global nutrition and food security objectives. We are broadly on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets in the first half of the compliance period. The immediate focus of the national low-carbon roadmapping process will be on making further progress in the second half, from 2017 to 2020. That is why Ireland's negotiations on its next set of targets, for the period to 2030, are focused on achieving a fair and manageable adjustment for that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_333">The Deputy did speak of targets; the principle is accepted. The reduction target that was set for 2020, -20%, was the highest of all the targets for all the countries in Europe. That is a fact. This was compounded by the fact that we were still expected to meet the target although we went over the cliffs economically.</p>

            <p eId="para_335">We have to be realistic about what we can achieve. I do not want to take any credit - I never have and never will - but must say that the European Council actually agreed with Ireland's position in that it has a very different profile from any other country in the European Union. The only country with a similar profile is New Zealand, because of its agricultural sector. This is why the European Council made a commitment on achieving consensus on what is fair and manageable but yet ambitious, given the fact that we can actually produce so much more and have a pretty sophisticated carbon footprinting situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_336"> From an EU perspective, the priority was to achieve agreement on an overall EU approach to climate change and energy priorities for the period to 2030. I am glad the European Union set an ambitious target. Headline targets under the EU 2030 climate change and energy framework include a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases, increasing the share of renewable energy to 27% and increasing energy efficiency relative to 2005 levels by 27%. These targets will put the European Union in a very strong position leading up to the UN conferences, this year in Lima and next year in Paris.</p>
            <p eId="para_337"> From a national perspective we had a number of concerns heading into the October meeting. The Cabinet sub-committee had discussed this in very considerable detail. Ministers and officials dealt with detailed negotiations with the Commission in the lead up to that Council meeting. Following the Council, I believe that these concerns will be addressed in a new way and that we have established the basis for a more realistic and achievable set of targets for 2020. The Council accepted some important principles about the scientific and economic realities of climate change mitigation. It is important to realise that none of this affects the overall EU ambition level. It simply sets out the basis for this country to achieve a fairer share of the burden than it has had up until now.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> I believe that we achieved a major breakthrough in regard to agriculture. For the first time, the Council specifically recognised that agriculture emissions are more difficult to mitigate than man-made emissions from energy use. This ensures that there will be a greater coherence between the EU's food security and climate change objectives. It is particularly important for Ireland where the unique position of our already highly carbon-efficient agriculture sector has been fully recognised. The capacity of afforestation to sequestrate carbon has also been recognised as a potential part of the EU's solution to dealing with climate change. That is important for Ireland and we have already agreed major investments with a view to expanding that level of forestry cover. Work will continue over the coming months to determine how this recognition will affect the 2030 targets for individual member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> I took the opportunity at that meeting to emphasise the economic and fiscal challenge that our country has endured and the effects that we are still dealing with, fragile as they are. I made it clear that our agreement on headline targets is based on a clear understanding that our non-ETS targets, which include agriculture, will take account of our specific circumstances. That is some of what happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> I have a number of other points. Deputy Martin mentioned the transport sector. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is looking at the question of the low carbon development Bill. The Government approved the drafting of that in April. On the basis of a submitted general scheme, the drafting of that Bill is currently being finalised with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Clearly, it involves issues of transport and emissions that will apply. In the first instance, the general scheme will include successive five-yearly national low carbon roadmaps and that will articulate a vision for low carbon transition and address greenhouse gas mitigation obligations on the State under EU law. Successive national climate change adaption frameworks will articulate a strategic policy to see that measures are taken at sectoral and local levels to reduce the State's vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change. In addition, the Bill will provide for the national expert advisory body on climate change which will provide advice to Ministers on the development of the national adaptation frameworks. Clearly, that includes the transport sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_341">I thank the Taoiseach for his statement in which he outlined his role at the UN climate change summit but he omitted one part of a very progressive politically-correct speech that he made. In the speech, the Taoiseach stated there is no time to waste in the fight against climate change and then he went to the European summit the following month and argued for concessions on Ireland's carbon emission reduction targets. He explained here in some detail why he did that, but surely he sees the contradiction between the position he took up at the UN climate change summit in New York and then the realpolitik of his position at the European summit. The Taoiseach has not explained that contradiction. The sensible thing would have been for him to have stated at the UN summit what he later stated at the EU summit.</p>
            <p eId="para_342"> All of us are alert to the dangers to the planet and we all have seen in our own lifetimes how the climate in our own small island has changed. Some world leaders, including former President Mary Robinson, have done significant work in making this issue a global issue. I happen to agree with the broad principle that there is no time to waste but then I wonder why it took three years since the Government came into power before it introduced the climate change legislation. The heads of Bill were only published in April last. I welcome them but they display a lack of binding targets which is a fatal flaw in any legislation, no programme, no timeframe and no sense of setting targets which would be both binding and achievable. As I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware as he is around here longer than I am, any legislation which does not contain those elements is little more than aspirational.</p>
            <p eId="para_343"> If what the Taoiseach stated in New York is a statement of Government policy, if there is no time to waste, we need a specific set of targets and we need these to be combined with an overall strategy, which is about reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels and about the development of renewable energy, which, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree, would have the potential to create thousands of jobs. If we do not have that type of policy, then the agenda will be set by private operators, and perhaps that is the Government's agenda in the first essence. We have seen a lot of this, for example, the abandoned project to export wind-generated electricity rather than utilise renewables to reduce our CO2 emissions, which, clearly, should be an objective of any climate change legislation. Then, if I understand it properly, Dublin City Council voted against the Poolbeg incinerator project but that has been proceeded with. It is an issue the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should be dealing with.</p>
            <p eId="para_344"> All of us have seen severe weather. We have seen it in flooding. We have seen the way our coastal regions have been hit with untypical weather. Therefore, climate change is a reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_345"> There is no point in going to big conferences and making the correct speech and then failing to take decisive action on the urgent issue. The Taoiseach draws attention to the big powers, China and India, which were both absent from the UN summit, but that does not mean we cannot act in our own place. We are teaching children to recycle. We cannot say to those children it does not make a difference because we are telling them that it does. Could the Taoiseach try to explain the "no time to waste" rhetoric of New York in the absence of no-time-to-waste legislation in the Dáil?</p>

            <p eId="para_346">The difference is realism. As I already pointed out to Deputy Martin, this country was given the highest target to achieve of minus 20% carbon emissions. It was utterly unrealistic.

            <p eId="para_348">-----including in the Ceann Comhairle's years when he did exceptionally well, but it was based on accurate scientific evidence. What happened here, in setting out the targets for Ireland for 2020, was based on an amalgam of different pieces of information.</p>
            <p eId="para_349">It set us a target that was utterly unachievable. One could ask whether we were to proceed on the basis that we accepted the target for 2020 and build on it for 2030, which would make it even more unrealistic, when the fines could increase to in excess of €1 billion and the concessions hard won by the people of this country would be wiped out. I say to Deputy Adams that it was important for us to be realistic about what Ireland could achieve. We have the scientific evidence to prove it and to back it up. We have drawn up a profile to show what we can do in the agri-sector, and what we are doing in terms of emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, among many other things. Next year, for the first time ever, he will publish maps of the areas around the country that are prone to flooding. A total of 300 areas have been identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_354">It is important that we have a national picture of the areas that are liable to flooding. This country will have to set aside specific resources to deal with such matters as the loss of Arctic sea ice and the rise in ocean temperatures. We do not know whether it will be on the scale of €2 billion or more, but in the next 15 to 20 years we will have to make a strategic plan and make arrangements to deal with it. Next year will be the first time we will have an idea of the scale of the challenge the country faces on a national basis. The task remains to be dealt with by whatever Government is in office in the future. The analysis has been put together by the Office of Public Works in conjunction with local communities and local authorities. The catchment flood risk assessment and management plans will be published next year, giving Ireland its own idea of the scale of what we must achieve. I was in Galway last year when the high tide met the high floods and the situation was a disaster within a short time. Strategic measures must be developed and put in place in Cork city and in Dublin to attempt to cope with nature, which as we are all aware is virtually impossible to deal with when it gets really angry.</p>
            <p eId="para_355"> The intention was to set out principles and to follow that with legislation and to introduce targets based on scientific accuracy. It is only right that we should be able to go to certain areas and say that we want to play our part but what happened previously was not realistic. We indicated what is realistic and provided the scientific evidence to prove it. We outlined that we would measure up to the following targets. On the basis of the European Council recognising Ireland’s agri-sector, and the contribution of afforestation and the planting of new trees in terms of sequestration, that gives Ireland’s negotiators a really strong back wall against which they can plan for the period from 2020 to 2030. I do not wish to see a situation where the population is crucified with enormous fines because of unrealistic targets being set when we know what will happen will be different. The Minister will introduce the Bill in due course, as I outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> We have a carbon emissions policy at the moment. Hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, are very powerful man-made greenhouse gases, with warming effects hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than CO2. At present, they represent approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but they are growing faster than any other greenhouse gas. The initiative supports a global phase-down of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. It commits Ireland to taking action to promote public procurement of climate-friendly alternatives wherever feasible and a gradual transition to equipment that uses more sustainable alternatives to HFCs. During Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year played a key role in the negotiation on the new regulation on fluoridated greenhouse gases, which includes a phase-down of HFCs.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> As a country that is highly dependent on road-based freight, the global action plan for green freight offers a welcome opportunity to learning and to sharing our experience with other countries, business and civil society. The action plan aims to raise the awareness and to work towards both aligning and enhancing existing green freight efforts through knowledge sharing, peer-to-peer partnerships and exchanges between Government and industry. We are currently examining a range of options to support a reduction in emissions. Such options would be aligned to the thrust of the action plan and would seek to minimise the negative impacts of freight on the environment in respect of costs, emissions and air quality. As Deputy Adams is aware, over the years the changes brought about in terms of VRT and taxation related to emissions has resulted in a reduction in emissions, which has played a not insignificant part.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_360">Such was the contrast between the Taoiseach’s noble aspirations for urgent action on climate change in his UN speech and his attendance at the EU summit a month later to seek concessions to reduce Ireland’s contribution to climate change improvements, one environmentalist commentator accused him of having had the political equivalent of a lobotomy between the UN conference and the EU summit. It was suggested that the Taoiseach had “taken political recklessness and cynicism to new lows. History may judge that he [the Taoiseach] did more than any other politician of his generation to destroy the future of Irish agriculture”. The last point is important. It is not just the case that the concessions he sought were retrograde in terms of the environment, but what he and other environmentalists have been trying to point out is that the biggest cost we face if we fail to radically reduce our CO2 emissions is damage to agriculture. The cost of that would be far greater than the fines the Taoiseach has used as an excuse for seeking a reduction in the targets, because the biggest victim of the consequences of climate change is agriculture. If we do not deal with flooding in particular, the cost for agriculture will be enormous, the very thing the Taoiseach says he is protecting in seeking concessions from the European Union in terms of the targets. The Joint Research Centre’s report on climate impacts in Europe suggests that agricultural yields across Europe will drop by 11%, and in Ireland by approximately 2%, if radical action is not taken on climate change. That would be a massive hit for Irish agriculture in terms of revenue and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> The same report indicated that Ireland and the United Kingdom would be the worst hit by the increase in flooding that has resulted from climate change. We have seen the consequences of that. The Taoiseach has justified seeking concessions on the targets in order to prevent us being levied with fines, but on the other side of the equation, if we fail to deal with the impact of climate change we will incur a far greater cost in terms of reduced agricultural output and damage to agriculture generally. That is why I and many others do not accept the rationale behind the Taoiseach seeking concessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_362">The Taoiseach was using quite colourful language suggesting that if we sought to meet these targets we would be completely screwed, as he said. It is interesting to note in the context of the debates about the use of colourful language these days that the Taoiseach himself is quite capable of using such colourful language. One might well say that we will be completely screwed if we do not meet the sort of targets that are being set.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> On the issue of forestry, which has been discussed previously in the House, I am glad to hear positive sounds from the Government in this regard but the problem is that the sounds are somewhat like the hyperbole used in the UN speeches. Are the sounds about the expansion of forestry as a carbon sink and improving forest cover being matched with action? They are not. We are spectacularly underperforming in meeting our afforestation targets. We have consistently failed to meet our afforestation targets year after year, despite the fact that we have the most favoured climate for growing trees. Our State forestry company is precluded from contributing significantly to the afforestation programme and the private sector is simply not delivering substantial afforestation. What are we going to do given that we have the perfect conditions to grow trees but we are not hitting anywhere close to our afforestation targets if we are serious about reducing CO2 and using forestry as a climate sink, not to mention the significant spin-off and employment and economic benefits that could come from afforestation? Why is there not a major public State investment in afforestation which would result in those positive spin-offs?</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> I am unable to tally commitments to dealing with climate change and reducing CO2 emissions with increasing fare costs for those using public transport. It is a contradiction in terms. Fares are going through the roof and are becoming unaffordable for people to the point that it is becoming cheaper to use one's car than to use public transport. While this remains the case, the Taoiseach cannot be serious in talking about reducing CO2 emissions. What are we going to do to reduce public transport fares in order that we expand the use of public transport and therefore contribute to reducing climate change?</p>

            <p eId="para_365">I do not know the environmentalist to whom the Deputy refers and from what he says I do not think I should read what he wrote, but that is neither here nor there. People are perfectly entitled to their views. The victims of inactivity about climate change are the people and not just agriculture. I make no apology for saying that the balance to be struck, as Deputy Boyd Barrett is well aware, is that milks quotas go in 2015. Our country has been constrained for very many years from reaching our potential in the agrisector, in the dairy sector in particular, because of those quotas which will be gone in 2015. An estimated increase in the national herd of approximately 300,000 cows is a natural consequence of the termination of quotas. On the one hand while we have a very sophisticated carbon footprint situation for our agrisector, we are in a position to produce far more food than we are producing. The Origin Green concept and the promotion by Bord Bia of high-quality food of great integrity is important in a world where there is starvation in many places. We are in a position to export high-quality, high-protein food for those who need it while maintaining our low carbon footprint, as against food that is being produced in other countries, possibly to an inferior level and with much higher emissions. That is one part of our profile which is relevant to our economic situation. If the Deputy is arguing that we should leave things as they are and that we allow others to produce low integrity food with high emissions, I do not agree with him.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has been dealing with the forestry situation for some time. I refer to the late 1940s when the then Minister, Joseph Blowick, was the first to initiate the forestry scheme. The Minister of State has completed his negotiations and his work on a very strong programme to incentivise forestry. People will not set land aside for afforestation unless it results in a worthwhile income stream, and why should they. Considerable areas of land are very suitable for the growing of particular trees such as spruce, for example. However, the scheme has never been as attractive as it should be. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, has done a great deal of work and he will lay out his scheme very shortly. </p>
            <p eId="para_367"> As I said in reply to Deputy Martin and Deputy Higgins, Ireland is being realistic about achieving our ambitions. Deputy Boyd Barrett will be aware that in my contribution at the UN conference in New York I stated that Ireland, along with its EU partners, has exceeded our first Kyoto Protocol targets. We have implemented a range of carbon pricing instruments, including a carbon tax. We have long-term objectives for 2050 of an 80% reduction across electricity, transport and the built environment, and we are a world leader in carbon-efficient agriculture and food production which is a major component of the Irish economy. The Deputy's environmentalist friend thought fit not to mention that.</p>

It states a system of universal health insurance will be introduced by 2016, with the legislative and organisational groundwork for the system to be completed within the Government's term of office. Will the Taoiseach indicate when this legislation will be introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The Government has indicated and promised a review of the fair deal system of financing nursing home care. More than 2,500 people have been waiting 20 weeks to be granted eligibility under the scheme, which is causing immense stress and anxiety. This is due to the lack of resources the Government has provided for the scheme. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the review of the fair deal scheme will be produced and when changes will occur to ensure people will not be waiting as long as they are at present?</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Legislation has been promised on assisted human reproduction, including to the law relating to parental relationships arising from assisted human reproduction. The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, recently stated it was a priority. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the heads of the Bill will be published? Will the Taoiseach again clarify the commitment in the programme for Government, which states the Government will legislate to regulate stem cell research? When can we expect this legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I wish to raise the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. Tá ceist agam maidir le reachtaíocht atá beartaithe le fada an lá. Táimid ag fanacht ar an mBille seo le fada. Tá a lán daoine an-bhuartha faoi. Tá mise, an Taoiseach agus daoine eile ag obair ar son daoine Éireannacha sna Stáit Aontaithe ach sa Stát seo níl an Rialtas ag déanamh an rud ceart leis na daoine bochta a tháinig anseo ó thíortha eile. Much has been said about the deplorable conditions of those seeking asylum in this State and the conditions in which they are forced to live. I have seen it myself in the Mosney accommodation centre in Louth, where some children aged nine or ten have been there all of their lives and have never known any other life. Residents from the centre will be in the Dáil on 3 December. Will the Taoiseach confirm what is the progress of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and how might it impact on those enduring life in accommodation centres? Will he also outline whether the Government has met groups such as the Irish Refugee Council or Nasc, which have levelled criticisms of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Tá ceist amháin eile agam don Taoiseach maidir le Bille na dteangacha oifigiúla. An tseachtain seo caite, dúirt an Taoiseach liom gur botún nó meancóg a bhí ann nuair a úsáideadh Google translate chun an suíomh idirlín do Chomóradh 1916 a aistriú go Gaeilge. Irish language groups, which were already very nervous about the intentions of the Government, see the fiasco of the disastrous use of Google translate as a blatant disregard for their rights and the rights of other Gaelgóirí. It all adds to the ongoing erosion of Irish speakers' rights, particularly and not least in Gaeltacht areas. The Taoiseach had promised to publish the official languages Bill this session and stated so earlier this month. Will he give certainty on the date? Will the official languages Bill be published, as was promised, during the session?</p>

Dúirt mé an tseachtain seo caite gur córas aistriúcháin a úsáideadh nuair a cuireadh ar an idirlín an téacs Gaeilge agus níor tógadh síos é. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé sin ceart sa chéad áit. Glacaim leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta agus nár chóir é a bheith le feiceáil ag chuile duine. Ní tharlóidh sé sin arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> In respect of the immigration Bill on the Order Paper, it will not proceed because too many amendments have been submitted. It will have to be redrafted and is listed for early next year. A great deal of work is going on at present because of the number of amendments submitted to it. The Deputy is aware the Government established an independent working group in regard to the question of immigration and direct provision. It was set up under former High Court judge, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, to report to the Government on improvements in the protection processes, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. This working group includes experts from various fields, such as NGOs and relevant Government Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> The Deputy is aware of the outcome of the court case on 14 November. Mr. Justice Mac Eochaidh gave his reserved judgment in the CA and TA judicial review proceedings challenging the legality and constitutionality of the direct provision system. The ruling was the applicants had failed to prove that direct provision is a breach of human rights or a form of inhuman and degrading treatment. This was the finding of a High Court judge. In his ruling the judge also dealt with the issues of visitor rules and independent complaints mechanism. It was very lengthy judgment, which has been published and I am sure the Deputy will read it. It must be studied very carefully by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister, with a view to its being implemented at the earliest possible time. In implementing the judgment, account must be taken of the continued safety and security of the residents, including specifically child protection and Garda vetting. This work is in hand following the judgment given on 14 November.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">On 21 October, the Minister for Finance stated he was looking forward to the fiscal assessment report. Statements were held in the House at the time, and the matter is No. 48 on the Order Paper. Will the Taoiseach put time aside as soon as possible for these statements to be resumed?</p>
          <p eId="para_394">That report now questions the expenditure figures outlined in the comprehensive expenditure report and questions the predicted revenue figures outlined in the budget. I am not sure if the Minister is happy with the final outcome of that report, particularly since he was looking forward to it. As a result of the mistakes made here, certain systems were put in place to avoid a recurrence. This was one of the mechanisms. The Government appears to have ignored the advice of the committee. Will the Taoiseach allow time for statements on the issue next week?</p>

          <p eId="para_395">I thank the Deputy for his comments. The independent Fiscal Advisory Council was established as a result of a recommendation from the troika to give independent fiscal advice to the Government. The Government is about considering and making decisions on budgetary matters. The Government must also take into account the social implications of recommendations from the independent Fiscal Advisory Council. Were the Government to have proceeded to impose a further €2 billion in cuts to services or whatever, people would have been very much more constrained than they have been. The Government took into account the social implications and set out the path to a sustainable future where flexibility emerging in the economy can be given back to the people, for instance, through reductions in income tax where a person on the minimum wage will get back about €173 starting in January. A person on the average industrial wage of €35,000 will get back €400 starting in January. A couple drawing €50,000 to €55,000 each will get back more than €1,000. The emphasis has been on the squeezed middle earning between €30,000 and €70,000. Had the Government taken the view of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council entirely to heart, the situation would have been very different.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The economy is showing signs of confidence. Our consumer confidence is the highest for seven years and the Deputy can see the impact of a rising economy in terms of traffic jams appearing again on roads. The number of cars being bought has increased. We are very conscious, as the Deputy is, that this has not filtered down to every family in the country and that is where we need it to be. Government is about judgment and making decisions. We chose to make these decisions on the basis of the implications for the people. I do not disagree with the Deputy's assertion that time should be allocated for a discussion on this at an appropriate time and I will discuss that with the Whip.</p>

These people leave the country within 24 hours. Great Britain is introducing new border control laws and passport rules and we need to look at this. It is a serious problem. The gentleman in my constituency who was robbed is now closing his business after last week's robbery. What went on was scandalous. We have to look at border controls and passport rules.

          <p eId="para_439">With regard to the promised criminal justice (offences relating to information systems) Bill, in May 2014 the report of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, which was set up by the previous Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, was published. It made two legislative recommendations, one related to the Non-Fatal Offences Against The Person Act 1997 and the other related to the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007. I raise this matter under the promised criminal justice (offences relation to information systems) Bill because of a blight on a great deal of political discourse, which is the issue of cyberbullying and the way in which some people are being attacked on the Internet in a totally ungoverned fashion.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter, which I have raised previously at the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Currently, Waterford is without a hospice and it is not only Waterford that is affected but the whole region of Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary, taking in a population of 0.5 million. As we approach 2015, we are still in the shameful situation where the south east of Ireland does not have a dedicated hospice building.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> Work is underway to address this, thanks to the hard work of the local hospice movements across the south east, in particular in Waterford. A design team was appointed this summer and meetings have been getting underway with the architects. It is hoped the planning application for the unit will be lodged in March 2015 and that the building will start in the summer of 2016, to be finished by the end of 2017. That is all well and good, and we look forward to seeing the work progressing, but it is currently costing Waterford hospice approximately €600,000 annually to provide home care services. Most of this amount - 67% - has been raised through donations from coffee mornings, sunflower days and local fund-raising by very loyal supporters.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">The HSE provides 33% of the remaining funding required. There is a great deal of money being raised and spent locally on the hospice home care packages. From my work with the hospice board, led by the chairperson, Danette Connolly, I know that it has always said that the HSE locally has been very supportive and helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> While the HSE is helpful, money talks. I have a rather alarming document, the response to a recent parliamentary question from me requesting a detailed breakdown of the funds. It makes for stark reading. In 2014, Milford Care Centre in Limerick received €11.5 million; Galway Hospice, €3.36 million; North West Hospice in Sligo, €2.59 million; Our Lady’s Hospice in Harold’s Cross, €13.23 million; Marymount Hospice in Cork, €6.5 million; and St. Francis Hospice in Raheny, €7.1 million. These hospices receive between €3 million and €13 million each year to fund services for people at the end of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> The picture in the south east, however, is not pleasant. Until September 2014, the Waterford hospice movement received the miserly sum of €140,000; the Carlow-Kilkenny home care team, €160,000; the Wexford team, €150,000; and the local hospice movement in south Tipperary, €170,000. The combined hospice service in the south east received €620,000 from the HSE until September of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> We do not begrudge the money to Limerick or Sligo or anywhere else for those caring for people who are very unwell, managing pain and at the end of their lives. The south east hospice normally gets approximately €800,000 per annum, still the lowest amount for any region in the country. It is hard to read these figures in the awareness that not only are the people across Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary being asked to fundraise for home care services but also to raise €6 million towards the palliative care unit. Anyone can see from these figures that the south east is missing out on a very big piece of the pie.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_706">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because palliative care is an integral part of the delivery of health services. We should be conscious that it is not always given at the end of life but ensures that people who have a condition that will end their lives can have a quality of life for a prolonged period which allows them live the best life possible. I take on board everything the Deputy has said but I know that the fundraising committee in Marymount in Cork, which is the one I am most familiar with, raised €28 million to put in place the fine hospice in Cork. I accept that there is a huge area of the country that does not have a hospice.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> Direct budget allocation for palliative care is €73 million in 2014, but this does not include expenditure on the specialist palliative care provided in 38 acute hospitals, approximately 170 palliative care support beds and designated home care packages. Most of the HSE's palliative care budget is provided to the main voluntary hospice organisations to provide palliative care services, including inpatient beds, home care and day care. The funding is provided under an annual service level arrangement with each organisation. Many agencies also provide additional services which are resourced through charitable fundraising, which, as the Deputy, said is an active part of what happens in Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> I am aware that Waterford home care services relies on voluntary fundraising to supplement the funding it receives from the HSE. This is also the case for the other palliative care home care services in the south east. The HSE funds approximately 40% of the running costs for each of the four providers. All of these teams provide support for palliative care patients with malignant and non-malignant conditions, and all provide a seven-day service. These teams, and the fundraising efforts behind them, provide a vital service for people with a life-limiting condition and their families in the south east, and this Government greatly appreciates their efforts to ensure quality of life for patients with a life-limiting diagnosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> I would like to see increased support for these services but despite better economic indications in recent times, funding is under pressure across the health sector and will remain so for quite some time, and it will continue to be very challenging to secure additional funds in these circumstances. I am also aware that Waterford home care services has agreed to raise €6 million to cover the capital cost of the new 20-bed specialist palliative care inpatient unit to be built as part of the redevelopment of Waterford Regional Hospital. The unit will act as a focal point for the provision of specialist inpatient beds, and community and day care services for patients and their families living in the south east.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> There are six similar proposals for new hospice units at various stages of development throughout the country where the voluntary hospice groups propose to provide the capital funding on the basis that the HSE will take on the ongoing operational costs. This year 16 new beds have opened at Marymount in Cork and all 24 new hospice beds in St. Francis Hospice, Blanchardstown, will be open by the end of the year. The University Hospital Waterford project, including the palliative care unit, is included in the HSE's capital plan for 2014. It is expected that the planning application will be lodged in March 2015. Construction is planned to commence subject to funding approval in the second quarter of 2016 and to be completed in the third quarter of 2017. Following commissioning and equipping, the unit is planned to open in early 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> The provision of the structure sometimes brings additional funding and this will help in the provision of service in that area. </p>

            <p eId="para_712">I thank the Minister of State. I am really delighted that the palliative care unit is in the capital plan for the HSE. Other governments reneged on their promises to the south east and Waterford in this respect. The fundraisers and activists behind this issue are glad to see a finishing line.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> In respect of life-limiting illnesses, the Minister of State is absolutely right that this is not just a once-off but can be an ongoing service throughout a person's life to improve quality of life. It is in a patient's interest to be kept at home as long as possible. The home care team does incredible work, which I have seen at first hand. The local fundraisers have to subsidise the home care packages because we get so little funding <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country, but that money could be diverted into the bricks and mortar of the hospice building. The local HSE has been very good and has a really good working relationship with the hospice. The end result will not just be a hospice unit on the grounds of University Hospital Waterford but a five storey building integrated into the plan for the hospital which will be an incredible facility for the people of Waterford and the south east. In the interim, however, the home care services are very poorly funded <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">I would like the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, why that is the case. This region has a population of approximately 500,000. Between 33% and 40% of the funding is being provided by the HSE. I understand that in other regions of the country, the salaries of the wonderful nurses who go into people's homes to provide such great care are paid for by the HSE, rather than from the buckets of fund-raisers.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">I suppose I have a little personal knowledge of this matter. I would have an affinity with it. Of course it would be an objective to be able to increase the budget in this area. It is not something that is being forgotten. We are very familiar with what happens, especially with the home care teams. I would like to mention an interesting development. Many people are staying and being maintained at home for a long time. This means the only people who are going into inpatient hospice beds are those with significant levels of need. Their demands are so great that even the very established hospices are experiencing funding difficulties. The fair deal has to be part of it. I would like to mention another matter about which we need to be very conscious. The VHI needs to be conscious of this as well, and it is in terms of the beds. If someone has been paying VHI all of his or her life, it just cannot suddenly stop for that little piece at the end of his or her life. In many cases, they are very conscious of that and they do deliver. We need to have a conversation with them about how best we can do that as well. I think it is far more complex than people imagine. If one talks to most of the voluntary organisations that deal with palliative care, they will clearly tell one that the needs of people during that journey, which can sometimes be extensive, are far more complex than we thought. Of course it would be magnificent to be able to increase the budget. It is not something that will slip off the agenda. We are very conscious of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_716">I thank the Minister of State for being here to take this debate today. We could not take it last Thursday. The funding provided to the Brothers of Charity and to Ability West in County Galway has been cut. I understand they received notification of this cut in October, even though it had been set out months previously. It seems that the cut stems from the Haddington Road agreement, under which savings were to be made, and from a value for money report that was carried out within these services. I would like to concentrate on the value for money report. The Minister of State might be able to give me some clarity on it. I understand that the details of this cut were set out to all the individual agencies involved a number of months previously. There seems to be some concern about the value for money report. The Minister of State might be able to let me know who carried it out. What were the terms and guidelines around that report? How is the cut of €5 million to be broken down between each of the individual agencies? It seems that €156,000 will come out of the budget of Ability West before the end of the year. How was it set out that Ability West would take such a cut? I think the cut being imposed on the Brothers of Charity is almost double that. How was the figure for that cut arrived at? There is some concern about how these cuts were arrived at and how they will be rolled out. I have been told that the HSE may have informed these agencies that the €5 million I have mentioned might be taken out of central Exchequer funding and would not be passed on down to the agencies at this stage. I know that half of the cut will come out before the end of this year and the full cut will come out in 2015. The Minister of State might be able to give me some clarity in that regard as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> Since the decision to impose this cut was arrived at and the agencies were informed of it, I have been contacted by a number of families and parents who are concerned about the effect it might have on them. I know the HSE said on 2 October that the agencies should achieve these funding cuts without affecting front-line services. Is the Minister of State convinced that it is possible for these savings to be made without affecting front-line services? If it is proven that this cannot be done, will it be possible to reverse the cut? Is there any way to make sure these agencies are well funded? Much of the concern that is being expressed to me relates to respite care. Many families desperately need the respite care service to continue. They are concerned that if this cut goes ahead, they and their loved ones will not have an opportunity to get a break of a week or two weeks. Many people have contacted me today to express concern about reports that there has been an 11% increase in middle management in the HSE. This has led to some frustration because it has happened at a time when a cut to front-line services seems to be coming down the line. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the issues I have raised with regard to the value for money report and its impact on these agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I seem to be going slightly over time on these matters. I genuinely do not mean to do so. I know we are stuck for time. The value for money report, which was carried out by the Department of Health, took approximately two years. It was very difficult to get the type of information that was necessary on the services that are being delivered and the cost per unit of those services. We needed to be very sensitive because one does not want to categorise people as "unit costs". Nevertheless, when an audit of this scale is being undertaken - we are talking about €1.4 billion here - there is a clear need for it to be broken down in such a way. The value for money implementation group is really getting under the bonnet in terms of the money that is spent and how it is delivered. It is also involved in the personalised planning that will have to accompany the capacity legislation. Such planning will deal with how to disentangle the people's preferred choices in terms of service, for example. I have never denied that various agencies and groups of people have delivered services that the State did not deliver. They are delivering those services on behalf of the people of Ireland. In the main, they are doing an extraordinarily good job. I include the two agencies mentioned by Deputy Connaughton in that.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> I will read out the prepared answer. If the Deputy wants to have a wider discussion at a later stage, I will not have a problem with that. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position regarding the funding provided by the Government for disability services this year. The vision for the HSE disability services programme is to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life. The HSE national service plan for 2014 and the accompanying operational plan for the social care division outline the quantum of specialist disability services, the key reform initiatives and the additional investment in 2014. The HSE has assured us that these plans will give effect to this vision in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> The HSE will spend €1.4 billion and employ approximately 15,000 whole-time equivalents to provide specified service levels in 2014. An additional investment of €14 million in 2014 has been made to address deficits in disability services, to deal with a reform programme that will transform services to a community-based model of person-centred supports and to focus on the implementation of the HIQA standards for residential services for people with disabilities. Value for money efficiency targets of €5 million were identified this year in the national service plan. In order to arrive at a fair and equitable allocation of these efficiency targets, the social care division of the HSE has been assessing the capability of the voluntary disability providers to implement the necessary measures. In recognition of the amount of time that is required to complete this work, I understand that just 50% of the 2014 requirement, or €2.5 million, is being assigned to agencies this year. We are doing that because we understand there will be difficulties in the transformation we need.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> The matter raised by the Deputy - the provision of funding to Ability West and the Brothers of Charity services in Galway - is relevant to this overall efficiency target. Ability West is funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 through a service arrangement. The 2014 budget allocated by the HSE amounted to €21.7 million. This year, Ability West will have its budget reduced by €156,600, partly in line with efficiency targets under value for money but also through savings achieved by implementation of the Haddington Road agreement, by which we must all abide. The Brothers of Charity services in Galway are funded by the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004. Services are provided through a service arrangement which is signed on an annual basis and reviewed continually.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The agency was allocated funding of more than €44 million in 2014. This year, Brothers of Charity Galway will have its budget reduced by €88,000 - not double Ability West's, but just over half - in line with efficiency targets set out under the value for money report. I have been assured that the HSE will continue to work with both disability agencies to ensure that efficiencies are achieved without impacting on service provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I will ask two questions. If the HSE cannot work with the agencies to make savings without hitting front-line services, what will be the next step in the process? Is there any possibility of a change in Ability West's €156,000 reduction? How will it be rolled out? People are concerned about the effects on front-line services. What effect has the €5 million reduction that was announced several months ago had on other agencies? I am sure the story is the same the length and breadth of the country. Have those agencies been in touch regarding that cut?</p>

            <p eId="para_724">Up until last year, every year that I was in this job - it was not a long time - I was told that applying a 2% cut to every agency was deeply and grossly unfair, as it did not take account of agencies that were doing things differently or progressing our aims for disability services, for example, centralised and personalised planning. We have since adopted an agency-by-agency approach. It is a mammoth task, but we are getting under the bonnet and taking a serious look at the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> The agencies to which the Deputy referred were told well in advance what would be the reduction in their budgets. There was, and still is, an interaction over service improvements, which is a new theme in the HSE and social care. We speak with the agencies about how we want everything to work. It is a question of operating differently. I am not saying that what was done previously was wrong - obviously, it was not. However, there are different ways of doing things. This is what we want and what we constantly hear. According to the groups representing the agencies, it was unfair to have an across-the-board cut and that we needed to cut based on what each agency could do. That is what we are doing now.</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> I happen to know Ability West. It does an extraordinary job in a different way. Unfortunately, there is no turning back. If, as we have done, we discover that some agencies find it difficult to continue providing the service in its totality, one must re-engage and take a serious look at how best to continue providing that service.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing us to raise this issue. I also thank the Minister of State for attending. A positive aspect of my locality is Naas hospital. It has tremendous staff and management and is probably one of the most efficient hospitals in the country in terms of what it sets out to achieve. It is in the process of seeking planning permission for an endoscopic unit, which I hope will be up and running in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> We must consider the demographical pressure on the hospital. County Kildare has the second largest population in Leinster and has a large number of over 65 year olds. Both trends will continue growing. There are also 17 nursing homes in the immediate vicinity of Naas General Hospital, which automatically places pressure on the hospital. I understand that some agency staff have been replaced by full-time nursing staff, given the difficulty involved in finding nursing staff. In fairness to the hospital's management, 46 beds are open that, strictly speaking, should not be, but this has placed additional pressures on its budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_730"> A couple of issues are causing this problem. The fair deal scheme has been delayed in respect of a number of elderly patients who, despite wanting to go to nursing homes, are still occupying beds in the hospital. The staff are under extreme pressure because of their workload and their numbers have decreased considerably. I ask that the hospital be allowed to work within its budget to open a number of extra beds on a permanent basis instead of <i>ad hoc</i> and without the HSE's approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">I will try not to go over the same territory. Approximately two weeks ago, nurses at Naas General Hospital took the unusual step of going out in protest during their lunch hours. Some of us joined them. The point they were trying to make was that they were presiding over an unsafe service. They took their decision with heavy hearts, as they are proud of their hospital. They were also concerned that working in the hospital's environment compromised their own registrations. I understand their point.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> On average, 12 to 17 of the hospital's patients per week are on the fair deal scheme. In terms of size, this is the equivalent of 50 patients at Tallaght hospital. The large number of nursing homes creates pressure, particularly since many Dublin patients go to nursing homes in Kildare. There is pressure at both ends, given the area's young demographic.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> Kildare has a population of 210,000 people. It is the fourth most populated county in the country. That its increasing population could lead to increased demands was never properly considered. The immediate recruitment of nurses is key. Some 24 nursing posts have been sanctioned. With 17 being filled on an agency basis, we are discussing seven or eight additional staff. Some of these posts have been funded by the hospital's management in an efficient way. The recruitment process has taken up to two years. There is a complicated system of recruitment. The staff are needed now.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> Keeping a fair deal patient in a bed costs six to seven times what it does to keep someone in a nursing home bed. The latter would achieve a better outcome for the individual and an acute bed would be freed for people who actually needed it. The approach being taken does not make sense for the hospital financially or in terms of safety.</p>

            <p eId="para_735">I thank the Minister of State for taking this important issue. Like my colleagues, I stood outside Naas General Hospital a number of weeks ago on a wet, cold Monday. I saw members of its nursing staff doing something that was not natural for them, that was, to be out in front of the hospital. They did not want to scare patients, but they needed to highlight their frustrations.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> The hospital has sought 24 full-time positions. Given the delay in filling a number of these by agency staff, it makes sense to go from agency staffing to full-time or full-time equivalent staffing. Approval for these positions needs to be fast-tracked, the red tape needs to be cut and the posts need to be advertised and filled as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> The 12 delayed discharges have had a knock-on impact within the hospital. The figure was higher a couple of weeks ago, but it needs to be cleared. There are great step-down facilities in, for example, St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">However, it is necessary to have those cases processed in order that they can be moved out of the system in Naas and to ensure that everyone who is in a bed in Naas hospital needs to be there and that every available bed in Naas is open and used fully. I support fully the management and staff at Naas General Hospital. When my constituents in Kildare South get sick, they depend on Naas General Hospital for that great level of care, both at emergency level and for longer stays. Members must support the staff, must make sure their working conditions allow them to do their job to the very best of their ability and must ensure there is a sufficient number of staff. Moreover, where it makes sense the movement of those staff members from being agency staff to being full-time equivalents should be fast-tracked and should happen as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Health, to outline to the House the current position on the matter. The HSE has advised that Naas General Hospital has experienced additional pressures this year with a 14% increase in emergency admissions in the year to date. Moreover, it has advised that there has been a 45% increase in the number of patients on trolleys since this time last year at the hospital. Naas General Hospital has also been obliged a number of times during the year to implement the full capacity protocol, which involves placing additional patients on trolleys to ward areas. I have been assured by the HSE that when Naas General Hospital experiences overcrowding in its emergency department, every effort is made to admit patients to inpatient beds based on clinical needs as soon as possible. The hospital has in place appropriate escalation policies and monitors its activities continuously. A number of measures have been taken to address the demand. The hospital currently has 30 additional beds open, which have remained open all year, and has additional beds open in the acute medical assessment unit and day ward to meet the demand from the emergency department. Moreover, from what the Deputies have indicated, this demand clearly exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> Notwithstanding current pressures, when compared with the baseline year of 2011, there have been 1,717 fewer patients on trolleys in the year to date in Naas in 2014. As for resources, the hospital's budget allocation for 2014 is €53.196 million with a staff of 637 whole-time equivalents. The hospital has appointed 26 staff nurses this year, 14 of whom were appointed as replacement posts and 12 as new posts. Furthermore, the HSE's national recruitment service currently is in the process of appointing a further eight nursing posts, of which six are replacement posts and two are new posts. I am assured by the HSE that the hospital will continue to engage with the HSE's national acute services and social care divisions to take advantage of additional capacity initiatives to relieve pressure on the hospital throughout the winter season.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> The Deputies also will be aware that Naas General Hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, which includes St. James's Hospital, Tallaght hospital, Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise and the Coombe Women &amp; Infants University Hospital. I am confident there will be a structured integration of Naas hospital into the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group in 2015 and this will provide support for Naas hospital in managing demand and delivering high-quality and safe patient care in a cost-effective manner. However, I accept fully that when one has such numbers of replacement posts and additional posts as I read out, it is clear there has been great demand on this hospital and it did not have the requisite number of posts it needed to manage that demand. I hope the additional posts, both replacement and new, will alleviate some of this pressure because I know how beneficial it is to have a hospital within one's own area.</p>

            <p eId="para_742">I think the Minister of State and welcome her response. As far as most people in Kildare are concerned, the point is to have a safe hospital and while this is the case, the members of staff there are under extreme pressure. One thing that can be degrading for those staff members is to hear each morning on the local radio station the number of people on trolleys. I am aware of how hard they are working and I understand what they are going through at present. While I welcome the additional staff, I note many of them are replacement staff and additional staff are needed. As I already pointed out, the area's demographics are changing as its population increases and there is additional pressure on the hospital itself. While the additional staff members are welcome, I will push constantly for additional funding and staff for the hospital because, as stated earlier, it is a focal point for the entire county. Naas General Hospital is associated with the entire county because it is situated right in the centre and I reiterate that the staff, who are working under considerable pressure at present, consider that additional staff members are required there.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">One thing one never used to encounter was the direction of people from the Leixlip-Celbridge area towards Naas as heretofore, they always were directed towards Blanchardstown and Tallaght hospitals. To an increasing extent, Naas is absorbing that major conurbation and consequently this is a kind of pressure the hospital had never experienced previously. I wish to echo the point about the staff and the kind of stress under which they operate. When one has replacement staff, obviously there is a training-in period and so on and part of the reason that staff members are being replaced is they are burned out, as one can only deal with stress for so long. It is useful to have the figure of a 14% increase in emergency admissions but unfortunately, it is historical and one must get to that point to prove there is pressure on the hospital. However, the very fact that such an increase is showing up demonstrates that demand is increasing because of the size of the county and the increased pressure from places that heretofore never depended on the hospital. In addition, the 2,000 people who are queueing to gain access to the fair deal scheme are putting enormous pressure on both Naas General Hospital and the Dublin and midlands hospitals to which it is connected. Consequently, there needs to be more than just the consideration of an historical model. Consideration must be given to planning to make sure this situation does not arise when there is clear and demonstrated demand that is an increased demand all of the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">I thank the Minister of State for her response. The figures she has outlined of an increase of 14% in admissions and a 45% increase in the number of people on trolleys show the pressure under which Naas is at present and has the potential to be in the future. This is November, not January, and the peak time has not yet arrived. Absolute flexibility is needed in aiding the hospital to continue to provide safe care. Everything must be done to help the management and the staff of Naas General Hospital, in this time of increased pressure on demand on its services, to ensure it has the requisite flexibility. I welcome the Minister of State's comments on the new appointments this year, as well as the replacements, but I urge the Minister of State to go back to her officials, to cut through the red tape and to ensure that those agency nurses can be turned into full-time equivalents and that the additional positions can be put in place as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">I take on board the point about that area and how that population base is increasing once again. This is a significant issue and although Naas General Hospital will become part of a bigger group, I do not believe this will deliver the type of solution that is needed. Perhaps consideration should be given to a broader solution in terms of extending the hospital. I always find that once a building comes in and begins to be developed, additional staff always follow. Clearly, however, there is a need to examine the population base and the rate of growth. This area always has been fast growing and while there was a little bit of a dip for a while, it is coming back. Perhaps this requires more than simply staff, even though staff members are of crucial importance. Perhaps it will be necessary to take a broader look at what is needed there.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_746">I regret that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is not in a position to be present but I understand he is on other business. As winter approaches, the storms of last winter are etched into the minds of certain people, that is, those who have experienced flooding in their homes and businesses and of their land. A series of terrible storms was experienced that left terrible devastation in their wake. In my constituency and home town, approximately 100 houses have been identified as being at risk of flooding. In addition, there was flooding to housing in another area outside Ross, as well as in Westport, Crossmolina and other villages and towns nationwide. As winter approaches, people are fearful that this entire disaster might happen again if we experience, as we did previously, bad weather combined with high tides.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> I welcome the work being done by the OPW in developing flood risk management plans. I understand it is studying 300 areas under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme and has prepared flood risk maps which identify areas at risk and list all the factors which contribute to flooding in order that we might obtain a true picture of the position. As a result of the OPW's work, options will be identified in the context of flood mitigation measures. As matters stand, however, the people to whom I refer remain in the same position as last year. In other words, they are facing into the same risks and problems. Rather than waiting for the various options to be identified, I am of the view that action should be taken. The Government committed €45 million in capital expenditure in respect of this matter for the period 2012 to 2016 and a number of minor works have been carried out by local authorities. However, there is a need to support people in order that they will not feel helpless in their homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_748"> I propose the establishment of a small grant scheme to be administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government under the auspices of the housing grants schemes currently operated by local authorities. They have the wherewithal to provide small housing grants. If grants were provided for matters relating to the risk of flooding, people would no longer feel helpless because they would be in a position to erect small flood barriers outside their homes as a short-term measure. In such circumstances they would be able to rest assured that they had done the best they can and that the Government has done all it can, despite the various time and financial constraints which obtain. Taking this type of action would be less costly to the State than being obliged to provide financial relief to people when their homes or properties have been destroyed.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> It is worth bearing in mind - this adds weight to the case I am making - that in many cases the owners of houses which have already been flooded can no longer obtain insurance for them. As a result, they will from now on be obliged to fork out their own money or turn to the State if their homes are again flooded. The type of flood barriers or gates to which I refer can be fitted for approximately €1,500 and I would welcome it if the State were to make a contribution in this regard. In assessing eligibility for grant payments, it would be necessary to examine the position with regard to the areas identified in the mapping exercise carried out by the OPW under the CFRAM programme. These areas could then be targeted and the people who live there could be empowered and enabled to take the action required rather than being obliged to wait years for the arrival of more long-term, effective solutions such as the construction of sea or river barriers. If it is decided to pay grants, I request that these have retrospective effect for those who have already forked out in order to have barriers put in place at their homes. When one considers what would be the final cost of repairing the damage caused by flooding, the case I have put forward makes a great deal of sense. I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who is not averse to the proposal I have just outlined. I am aware of the financial constraints that obtain but I am of the view that this would be a worthwhile exercise.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_750">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. It was very good of her to allow the debate on it to proceed in light of the absence of the relevant Minister, Deputy Kelly.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> The Office of Public Works is the lead State agency for flood risk management in Ireland. I understand the office is putting in place a range of measures to assist householders in flood-prone areas, based on its national programme of river catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, studies. This work is being undertaken in partnership with local authorities in order to meet national flood policy needs. The final outcome of the CFRAM programme is a comprehensive plan for areas at risk of flooding. This plan examines all possible options to address flood risk in particular areas and sets out a series of integrated measures of a structural and non-structural nature, as appropriate. I understand that draft CFRAM plans will be available by the end of 2015, with a view to their being finalised in 2016. These plans have already been completed in many areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_752"> It may be the case that in certain situations, structural or hard defence measures, such as walls or embankments, are not possible or appropriate to address the flood risk affecting a particular community or property. In such instances, the CFRAM plan may examine the viability of an option of individual property-protection measures as a way of addressing the flooding problem. This, however, would be considered in the context of the overall scheme to be implemented for the community in an area at risk of flooding as a whole, rather than as a type of grant scheme for individual property owners. As flood mitigation works issues do not fall within the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, he has no plans for a housing grant scheme of the type suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_753"> While the CFRAM programme will map out the State's strategy and priorities for flood defence investment for the period from 2016 onward, significant investment has already been, and will continue to be, made pending the programme's completion. From 1995 to date, almost €370 million was invested in flood risk management measures. These measures have protected 10,500 properties and have delivered benefits estimated at over €1 billion in terms of damage and losses avoided. The Government has prioritised investment in flood risk management by allocating a further €225 million for the period 2012 to 2017 as part of its infrastructure and capital investment framework. This is a very substantial financial commitment in the current difficult conditions and underlines the priority the Government attaches to this matter. There has also been significant investment in smaller scale, localised protection measures through the OPW's minor works scheme. Approximately €29.3 million has been approved for 422 projects since 2009, with approximately €25.1 million being expended on works which have been undertaken so far.</p>
            <p eId="para_754"> In March 2014 the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works announced details of a memorandum of understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, on the exchange of information on completed flood defence works. Under this, Insurance Ireland members have been taking into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas since 1 June last. To date, the Office of Public Works has provided to Insurance Ireland information on 12 completed flood relief schemes in an agreed format. It should be borne in mind that decisions on the provision of flood insurance cover and on the premiums to be charged will remain a commercial matter for individual insurance companies. However, it would be the expectation that the operation of the memorandum of understanding and the continuing investment by the State in major flood defence works will lead to the greater availability of flood insurance in areas benefitting from those works.</p>
            <p eId="para_755"> I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_756">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I was immediately struck by a certain aspect of it as she read it into the record. I refer to the fact that - as was the case when flooding occurred last year - certain issues fall within the remit of the OPW, that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for providing emergency responses, that other matters are proper to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and that lands or property located within a special area of conservation, SAC, are overseen by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. There is a need for a cross-departmental approach on this matter. I accept that this need has been identified but I would like to see the actual approach implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> I raised this matter with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government because I am quite satisfied as a result of my experience in dealing with householders trying to obtain assistance from the State that the OPW has nothing to offer in the way of short-term solutions. I welcome the plans to put in place longer-term, significant solutions. I hope that such solutions will take account of the future rise in sea levels to which global warming is going to give rise. The easiest way to assist people in putting in place short-term solutions would be through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. As already stated, I have mentioned this matter to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin. I am of the view that the Ministers at the various Departments to which I have already referred should work together on this matter. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for putting in place the response to any emergency which might arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> Provision of the type of assistance I referred to in my initial contribution would very much ameliorate people's concerns. As is normally the case with housing grants, the Government would not be obliged to pay the full amount for the erection of the small flood barriers or gates I described earlier. Local authorities are excellent when it comes to disbursing small grants of the type to which I refer. I acknowledge that work is being done but there are many householders and business owners who have not and may not benefit from this.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">People understand that and the financial constraints but just want some assistance. I ask that this measure be discussed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the other appropriate Ministers because it is very worthwhile. It would result in savings for the State in the longer term because it costs the State more money to assist financially people who are flooded but who have no insurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_763">In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_764">"<b>3. </b>The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann an analysis of the tax changes in this Act, and the total of tax changes and spending adjustments of Budget 2015, setting out the continuing impact on people based on their gender, income, age, marital and disability status.".</p>
          <p eId="para_765">We discussed at a meeting of the finance committee Sinn Féin's long-term policy of having equality budgeting at the heart of what we do in Leinster House and across the island. There has been growing momentum in this regard among campaign groups and advocacy groups dealing with people at the coalface. They demand equality budgeting and believe it is a practice that the Government should not fear and that it is very necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> As the Minister knows, my party has published legislation in this area. He and his colleagues in the Labour Party have voted against it. At the time of the vote, however, there was a suggestion that the Government would introduce some type of equality budgeting, but it has not materialised. I heard the Minister's comments on Committee Stage to the effect that the analysis at the back of the budget book of the financial circumstances of couples, including couples with children, and various other earning groups is a form of equality budgeting and a means of outlining the impact on certain people in society. This is a far cry from what is suggested in the Sinn Féin legislation and the amendment before the House tonight. The amendment is about ensuring that the continuing impact on people based on their gender, income, age, marital status and disability status will be assessed before and after any major budgetary decisions. Equality budgeting should not be just an issue in terms of the budget itself because, when dealing with big policy areas, we should be always conscious of the impact on various sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> This amendment is a very clear attempt by my party to make equality budgeting a standard part of budgeting each year. There is nothing really to fear but the Government obviously fears something in respect of putting equality budgeting at the heart of its assessments of the impact of various sectors. This is clear from its taxation measures. Euro for euro, the biggest benefits rest with the higher income groups as opposed to those on the average industrial wage, the minimum wage, or less. When one takes into account factors such as the water charges that are coming down the line and other pressures, one realises those with a very low disposable income will feel the brunt of the budget the most.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> I commend the amendment to the House. I am not confident the Government will accept it given its track record in equality but my party and I feel very strongly about it.</p>

The Government's counter-motion makes reference to what appears to be a new initiative. I hope the Minister can set out what that means. The counter-motion states a social impact assessment of the main tax and welfare measures will be carried out by a cross-departmental body led by the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Social Protection before the publishing of budgets. Will the Minister elaborate on what that means? When he does, we might make some progress on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">I support the amendment. I would go further and say that while it is useful to have it a few weeks after the budget, there is no technical reason the Dáil should not be presented with equality budgeting on the day of the budget.

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_771">I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for tabling this amendment. In the debate on Committee Stage, I indicated that a substantial amount of analysis governing some of the groups the Deputy mentioned has been already published by the Department of Finance, or is due to be published in the coming months by Departments and other organisations. As such, I will avoid covering this ground again.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> The Deputy noted the wide-ranging impacts of budgetary measures on social groups and difficulties in aggregating these disparate impacts on particular social groups. From my Department's perspective, a significant proportion of policy measures is covered by the SWITCH model. I am informed that the ESRI has been recently investigating how the model could be expanded to include other areas of policy, such as policy on indirect taxes. In addition to these tax items, the same model is being expanded to cover issues concerning housing and medical cards. The Deputy can appreciate the significant resources that need to be invested in the model to incorporate these effects, as well as the importance of these policy issues in Ireland at present. When included in the model, the measures will allow the simultaneous measurement of the impact of different policy areas on members of society by income, family status and economic status. It is not currently analytically possible within SWITCH to assess the impact of budgets on groups of people based on their marital or disability status. As I believe I have made apparent, there are already significant efforts under way to expand the capacity of the model to cover key issues currently affecting Ireland. Expanding the capacity of the model to include impacts on marital status, for example, would limit the ability to achieve the goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> There are trade-offs that need to be borne in mind when it comes to thinking about the best way to expand the capability and coverage of the SWITCH model. It is essential to identify priorities among the many desirable improvements that one would wish to see in the modelling framework. However, as the Deputy may be aware, research by the ESRI indicates that budgets from budget 2009 to budget 2013 did not have a significant differential impact on people based on their gender. This reflects the fact that the tax and social welfare systems do not discriminate based on gender. Further versions of the SWITCH model may include gender-based analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> On the basis that the analysis proposed in the amendment is already published, or is due to be published, and given the infeasibility of aspects of the amendment, I cannot accept it. Deputy Michael McGrath has rightly drawn attention to the fact that the Technical Group has tabled a motion for tonight that covers some of the same ground referred to by Deputy Doherty.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> There is a counter-motion tabled by the Government and there will be a further explanation of what is in mind tonight. It would not be appropriate for me, at 6.40 p.m., when a debate is scheduled for 7.30 p.m., to give a preview. However, the Deputy is correct. There is an initiative being taken which will further improve the general proofing of budgets. I thank the Technical Group for its lengthy proposal and I hope it will be pleased with the Government's response to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">I put it to the Minister that this is the time and place to discuss this issue. A person democratically elected to this House has tabled an amendment to legislation that is to pass through this House this evening and this is when we are debating it and hearing the Government's response. A year and a half ago, legislation on equality budgeting was produced by my party and at that time the Government's response was that an initiative would be taken to bring forward its own equality impact assessment of budgets, etc. When the Independent group brings forward not legislation, but a detailed motion on the matter, there is more movement from the Government but a repeat of the assertions that were made during the debate a year and a half ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> Today there is a Bill. This is where we put it into law. Whatever is said during Private Members' time in the Dáil by the Government, there is no requirement on the Government to follow through. There is no protection, for example, for women or persons with disabilities, to have recourse to the legal mechanisms of the State to assert that the Government acted unlawfully in introducing a budget in 2015 or 2016 without carrying out an equality impact assessment. That will not emerge as a result of the motion that may be passed in the next 48 hours following acceptance of the amendment that the Government puts forward. If we were to put it into legislation tonight, however, then we would see something very different.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I am disappointed. If the Minister thinks that something substantial will happen, I will welcome it. However, for the reasons that I outlined earlier, I would like to see the legislative basis for something of that nature. As for what I have heard so far from the Minister, I am mindful that he is holding back to see what his colleague will say later on this evening when this amendment on the Bill will be dispensed with and there will be no opportunity to deal with it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Regarding the Minister, Deputy Noonan's contribution on Committee Stage, before the Government was forced into tabling a counter-motion, the argument he put forward was that equality budgeting is included already in the budget book, which is the height of nonsense. The analysis, in the case of Sarah and Mick, etc., and the impact that the provisions would have on different income sectors is not the type of equality budgeting that we would have and the reliance on information, such as that of the ESRI, that tax has not had an impact, in particular, on gender, may or may not be accurate. What we are talking about here is an overall assessment of the impact on budgets on certain groups. In the period the Minister talked about, 2009 to 2014, I would contend that the issue of child benefit payments, that were cut continually by the Government, impacted on a section of society which was female. Other issues include the taxation of maternity benefit and the other changes to maternity benefit. The respite grant payment also predominantly goes to females, who are largely the carers in society. I would contend that there has been more of an impact on females than on males, and there were other such measures in different budgets. That is something that equality budgeting would pick up on. It is not something that the ESRI is picking up on because it deals with tax measures, but one must look at it in the round.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I am disappointed, to say the least, that we do not have a legislative basis for equality budgeting. I will listen carefully to what the Minister's colleague will say, but I hope it is more than what was said a year and a half ago. As I said to the Minister previously, this Government's record on equality and equality budgeting is a disgrace. If we are to see equality budgeting, the Minister will be in his fifth year before it is introduced. There was no reason that it was not introduced before the budget. If the Government is committed to introducing equality budgeting, then let us have an assessment of this budget in terms of the different sections of society and let us have a debate about what are they right groups of individuals that we should be assessing.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">I already dealt fully with Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment and stated I am not accepting it on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> As I mentioned, one of the reasons I brought forward this issue is that the ESRI recently published a gender analysis of the budgets from 2009 to 2013, inclusive. This analysis, which was funded by the Equality Authority, was exploratory and required significant resources to extend the capability of the SWITCH model to analyse this issue. It would require further significant resources to fully implement in the model the capacity to carry out analysis of budgets in this regard. However, it showed that those budgets did not particularly disadvantage anyone because the social welfare code and the tax code have been gender blind for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> On the separate issue of the Private Members' debate tonight, I replied to the remarks made by Deputy Michael McGrath. It has been custom and practice, and, indeed, it has been governed by a Standing Order for a long time, that when we know there is imminent business we do not try to pre-empt it by having a preliminary discussion which takes away the advantage from the proposers of a particular motion. Private Members' time is less than an hour away and the Government will reply here through its spokesman later this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Deputy Pearse Doherty alleged twice that the Government's record on equality - from the context, he is talking about equality between men and women - is poor. That does not stand up to any analysis on a day when a woman has been appointed Garda Commissioner and the recommendation to appoint her was from a woman Minister for Justice and Equality. When the Attorney General, the Chief Justice, the DPP and the chairman of the new police authority are women, it is hard to argue that the Government has not made significant progress in the advancement of women and in removing the glass ceilings which kept capable women from reaching their full potential for so many years. I reject the Deputy's allegation out of hand. Very significant progress on equality issues has been made by this Government.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_785">The Minister will know well that the women he mentioned in his response are not the women I am addressing in terms of equality budgeting. I wish each one of those women well in the posts they hold, but each one of them is in a well-paid position for the responsibilities and duties they will carry out on behalf of the State. They are not the ones who need equality budgeting to be enshrined in law to ensure they are protected. Although I am not privy to their salary, few of those women would be earning less than €100,000. That is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about is the Minister's record on inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> I refer to the consistent cuts, for example, in Traveller education and support, in tackling the scourge of drugs, in particular, in the capital city, in services for people with disabilities and access to front-line services. I also refer to taking away the medical card from children with life-limiting conditions. These are the types of issues on which the Government has earned an F grade in terms of equality. I do not refer to the fact that the Government appointed women to some of the highest levels of authority in the State. This is not about gender equality; it is about budgeting equality. It is about how the decisions the Minister has taken impact on certain sections of society. While these might be small in terms of the overall magnitude of cuts and tax increases that have taken place, they affect key areas. Some of the most deprived groups in society had very little to start with, but were left with less as a result of these cuts. That is something that should have been targeted, challenged and identified as a result of equality budgeting. I stand over my argument on equality budgeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> The Minister outlined a clear and rational position to the effect that there is a motion before the House and it is standard practice that we give the proposer of the motion the due courtesy of hearing the response to it. That is fine. It is right and proper that the Minister would afford such a courtesy to the Technical Group, the proposers of the Private Members' motion that will be debated later. I only wish the Minister would afford me the same courtesy, because I put forward the proposal before the Technical Group. We are dealing with two different issues. My amendment seeks to have a legislative basis for equality proofing of this year's budget. This is the time and place for the debate on the amendment that is before the House, but for some reason the Minister does not wish to inform me of what he plans to do next year with the budget or with this budget because I am not due the same courtesy from him as is the Minister for Finance, in terms of my amendment which is before the House and on which we will vote in the coming minutes. I am not deemed worthy of the same type of regard the Minister will rightly afford to the Technical Group proposers. I wonder why I am not.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> There is a weakness in the Minister's argument because when Private Members' motions are put forward, one of the first things that happen is the Government briefs the media about what it intends to do, approximately two days' before the debate, to take the sting out of the tail. The Government's response to the motion is usually in the Sunday newspapers three days before the proposal is debated. If memory serves me, our proposal for equality budgeting was the script that ran at that point. I am disappointed no legislative basis is being afforded to equality budgeting at this point. As a result of that, and the Minister's comments, I have no option but to press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">I understood that the Deputy's position on equality is that all women are created equal and that all men are created equal and that we should ensure under our laws that men and women are created equally as well. I did not understand that he had a more restricted definition of equality where only those subgroups selected by Sinn Féin are to be treated equally and it is not a general principle he is enunciating. I replied fully to his amendment. I do not understand why he has a personal grievance about it. We are not legislating in this Finance Bill along the lines of the amendment proposed by the Deputy, but as Deputy McGrath has pointed out, there will be a policy statement later this evening and if legislation is required to fulfil the objective of the policy statement, it will be put in place in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">I move amendment No. 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_905">In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_906">
            <b>“Report on home carer’s tax credit</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_907"><b>3. </b>The Minister shall, within 3 months of the enactment of this Act, bring forward a report on the costs and benefits of the home carer’s tax credit.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">We debated at some length on Committee Stage the income tax package announced in the budget last month. One cohort of people whom I highlighted is that of single income couples who may be married couples or civil partners, whose income falls just below the threshold for entering the higher rate of tax, for example, a couple with just one person working where the household income is in the region of €40,000 or €41,000. They are benefitting from the budget to the tune of €174 by virtue of the changes to the universal social charge but they are not benefiting from the other two elements of the Minister's tax-cutting package, which are the extension of the lower rate band and the reduction of the marginal rate of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> I made the point on Committee Stage that couples in this category are among those who are really struggling. Their incomes are above all the eligibility thresholds for a medical card, rent supplement and various social welfare entitlements, yet they are benefiting to the tune of only approximately one quarter, compared to a person earning €70,000 who is gaining by almost €750. This is a gain of €750 for someone on €70,000 or more, as opposed to €174 of a gain for a single income couple earning €40,000 or €41,000. </p>
          <p eId="para_910"> The Minister acknowledged on Committee Stage that tweaking the entry point for the marginal rate of tax and cutting the top tax rate results in anomalies. In my view this is a significant anomaly. I am raising the issue by means of the vehicle of the home carer's tax credit which was introduced in 1999, some 15 years ago, and which is set at the rate of €850 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">It is there to benefit one income couples, where one spouse or civil partner stays at home to mind a dependant person, who generally is a child. The Minister could use this vehicle to iron out the anomalies created by way of the tax package.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_334" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_912">I thank Deputy McGrath for the amendment. The system of individualisation has been in the tax code since it was introduced by the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, in 1999. It is now integral to the overall system. When first announced, the stated purposes of individualisation were, essentially, to ease the burden on single persons, 65% of the workforce; to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax; and, more generally, to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate. Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro, or punt as it was then, earned. In tandem with individualisation, a home carer's allowance was introduced to compensate couples where one spouse stays at home to care for children or other qualifying individuals. As the Deputy may recall, there was a major row about individualisation and the allowance was introduced subsequently. The arguments I have outlined for the Deputy are those put forward by Mr. McCreevy when he introduced individualisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed. The result is we now have a hybrid system, with the standard rate band partially transferable between spouses, €9,000 being the gap between the single and married one earner bands. To complete a reverse individualisation would cost approximately €800 million. The Commission on Taxation recommended no change be made to the current system. It concluded the current system represents a balance between acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation. On the home carer's tax credit, the commission stated it was integral to the current hybrid system of individualisation and that "it would not be realistic to contemplate its withdrawal while the current arrangements in relation to the tax bands continue to exist or in circumstances where band individualisation is completed".</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> The Deputy may be aware that on budget day the Department published a number of policy documents, including the report on tax expenditure which included new guidelines for best practice in <i>ex ante</i> and <i>ex post</i> evaluation of tax expenditure. The report describes the purpose and main features of tax expenditure in an Irish context. In particular, it outlines the limited circumstances where tax expenditure should be used as an alternative to direct Exchequer funding. The report also discussed tax expenditure evaluations carried out in Ireland in recent years. The guidelines are informed by international best practice in this area and work carried out in other countries. It is available on the budget website, and the guidelines have been circulated to the Secretaries General of all relevant Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> I am not minded at this time to embark on a full cost-benefit analysis of the home carer's tax credit, given the recent reviews carried out by the Commission on Taxation. However, the Deputy may be interested to know the Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 2012, the latest year for which figures are available, the home carer's tax credit cost €63.2 million and was availed of by 84,400 families. The credit is currently worth €810 per annum for qualifying families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_916">I thank the Minister for his reply. In order not to be misinterpreted, I certainly do not advocate that the home carer's tax credit be reviewed with a view to abolishing it. I am using this tax credit to highlight an issue which has arisen in the context of the budget, which is the situation facing one income couples earning approximately €40,000. They will gain from the budget to the tune of €174, which will just offset the new water charges, whereas a Deputy in the House will gain approximately €750 per annum, which is 4.3 times the cash gain of somebody earning €40,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> In many instances, these couples earning €40,000 are really struggling because they do not qualify for anything as they are above all of the income thresholds. Given the Minister made the decision to embark on a tax-cutting package, in my view he could have designed it more fairly so the step effect between people who fall just below the entry point of the marginal rate and those above the marginal rate need not have been as great as it was constructed by the package. This is the issue I am highlighting. The Minister has acknowledged these issues will emerge when one seeks to change the entry point to the higher rate of tax and cut the marginal rate of tax itself. The net effect is people in this situation are no better off as a result of the budget. They are among the very people who are struggling the most and who need the most help from the State at this time. In contrast, people who need less support at this time are benefitting four times more. I am highlighting this issue to place it in the Minister's mind so that if he does go down this road again next year - he has indicated he will do so, with additional changes to the universal social charge and the entry point to the marginal rate and cuts to the marginal rate itself - he will take into account the people in this category who, in my view, were largely left behind this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_918">I accept the Deputy's bona fides on this, but the home carer's allowance is only one part of the measures introduced to repair the damage done to one earner families when individualisation was introduced in 1999. The reason married one earners do not benefit as much from the income tax cuts as single individuals or two earner couples is because they already pay much less income tax. It is not because of the home carer's allowance; it is because of the transferable standard rate band. A married, one earner couple on €55,000, with children, will pay 54% less income tax than a single individual in 2014 and next year it will be 55% less. They also benefit from the reduction in the higher rate band. The benefits apply to the one earner family, married or partners, with children. It is the standard rate band, and the fact this can be combined, that gives the benefit. The Deputy's point is fair enough - there are many issues to be examined between now and next year and we can include it in the mix.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_921">In page 16, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_922">
            <b>"Amendment of section 467 of Principal Act (employed person taking care of incapacitated individual)</b>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_923"><b>12.</b> Section 467 of the Principal Act is amended in subsections (2) and (3) by substituting "€75,000" for "€50,000" in each place.".</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief at the marginal rate for expenses incurred by an individual who employs a carer to take care of an incapacitated individual in his or her own home. This amendment increases the maximum amount of expenditure that qualifies for relief from €50,000 to €75,000 per annum. I decided to make this amendment on foot of a request I received from the Minister for Health, as the scheme greatly assists with people's preferred option to be able to remain in their own home. As a result, this frees up nursing home beds, which will help reduce waiting lists for such beds and relieve pressures on hospitals. Among the approximately 800 delayed discharges from hospitals are persons who could be cared for in their own homes. The most up-to-date available statistics show that in 2012 the scheme cost approximately €7.4 million in respect of 1,780 claimants. It is estimated the increase in the maximum amount allowable for tax relief to €75,000 per annum will cost approximately €350,000 in a full year. This additional cost can be justified given the importance of the scheme in allowing incapacitated individuals to be cared for in a home environment and the potential freeing up of acute hospital beds and nursing home places.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_932">In page 16, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_933">
            <b>“Amendment of section 462B of Principal Act (personal allowances and reliefs)</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_934"><b>12. </b>Section 462B of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following new subsection (2A) after subsection (2)—</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_935">“(2A) Where the primary carer has insufficient income to avail in full of the single person childcare credit the other parent may avail of the full or unused amount of the credit, on condition that the other parent has met any court ordered maintenance payments.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">One of the most controversial elements of budget 2014 was the abolition of the one-parent family tax credit and its replacement with a new single person child care credit which could only be claimed by one of the parents. That resulted in a loss of income for some single parents of up to €2,500 - €1,650 in respect of the actual tax credit and a further €800 or so in respect of the loss of the additional band at the low rate of which they had been availing. That was up to €2,500 net income - most people would have to earn up to €5,000 gross to earn that amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> An issue has arisen since then. One parent is not allowed to transfer any unused or unclaimed credit to the other parent in the event that the primary carer does not have a sufficient tax liability to absorb the tax credit in full. If that person wishes and is willing to transfer the remainder of that tax credit to the secondary carer, he or she is unable to do so. If the primary carer is not in a position to use any of the tax credit, he or she can sign a Revenue form and transfer the entitlement to the €1,650 credit to the secondary carer in full, but that requires that person's consent and there are a number of conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> I am proposing that if the primary carer has a tax liability but not a sufficient tax liability to use the tax credit in full, he or she should be permitted with his or her consent to transfer the unused credit to the secondary carer so that this person could reduce his or her tax bill accordingly.</p>

When we discussed this on Committee Stage, the Minister explained the concern he was addressing, which seemed quite a reasonable concern, that for one child numerous people could claim to be a carer and potentially claim quite a lot for the one child because so many people were involved. When we discussed this last year, the Minister said he was inclined to take a look at it. As it stands, if the single amount cannot be transferred, it is clearly less useful to people on lower incomes than those on higher incomes who can use it. It seems, therefore, like a very sensible amendment. It was a sensible amendment last year and I support Deputy Michael McGrath in proposing it this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_940">I add my support to the amendment. I cannot imagine that the cost to the State would be substantial. Does the Minister have figures for the number of secondary carers who could avail of this provision if the amendment were enacted and the costs associated with it? What Deputy Donnelly said about the Minister's response last year makes sense. Obviously this is in a controlled space. There is already provision to assign the credit to the other carer so there are measures to ensure it is paid out to those who are caring. A person who fulfils those conditions should be able to avail of the unused credit. I commend the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">As the Deputy will be aware, the single person child care credit is, in the first instance, only available to the primary carer of the child. In circumstances where the primary carer cannot utilise the credit - for example, because of insufficient taxable income - the primary carer may relinquish the credit and a secondary claimant may claim it. However, the requirement for a primary claimant to relinquish the credit before a claim from a secondary claimant can be considered is necessary, as in the first instance, only one credit is available in respect of a qualifying child or children.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> There are many reasons that a primary carer may not wish to relinquish the credit. Only that person can gauge whether his or her income would be of a sufficient amount over the course of a tax year to be able to utilise the credit. An individual may wish to retain the credit in the expectation that he or she may find employment during the year, for example. In addition, taxpayers are entitled to review their tax affairs over a four-year look back period and, depending on circumstances, an individual might wish to retain the credit in order to offset any tax liability that might arise as a result of a review of his or her income tax liabilities in any of the years concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> I have considered the possible automatic transfer of the credit in cases where a primary carer refuses to relinquish it. However, there are many reasons that this would not be feasible, including logistical, data protection and constitutional concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> As regards tax relief for maintenance payments and other costs incurred by separated parents, the position is that maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse. The effect of this is that the payments are treated in the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> The Revenue Commissioners inform me that, as of October 2014, there were 86,368 primary claimants and 2,903 secondary claimants of the single person child care credit which suggests to me that the tax credit in its current form is working as intended and I have no plans to change it at this time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_946">My amendment respects the principle of one credit in respect of a child. We are not talking about a second credit, but the potential sharing of the one credit between both parents. We are taking about the secondary carer making a real and meaningful contribution to the upbringing of the child. Many of these people took a savage hit in last year's budget. They lost €2,500 in many cases. I am suggesting that with the consent of the primary carer who is not in a position to avail in full of the tax credit but does avail of it in part, the remaining balance of the credit would be transferred to the secondary claimant. That is the essence of the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> It is a modest change that respects the principle that the Minister introduced last year of one credit in respect of the child. It deals with the issue of multiple credits being claimed by a number of persons in respect of the care of one child. The reality is that many parents, who are heavily involved in the upbringing of their children, who are paying substantial payments and who are spending as much time as they possibly can with their children, are in difficult circumstances where a relationship has broken down. This is a very modest change to what was introduced last year. It would be practical to do so. I ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">I will be very brief. The reasons the Minister gave are technical in nature, as Deputy Michael McGrath said. It seems that a waiver on the unused portion at the end of the given tax year would do away with that. While the Minister has outlined the technical reasons, is he opposed to the principle, which is the sharing, the capping at still one credit's worth, and if he is not, is it something we could explore where a technical solution can be found?</p>

          <p eId="para_967">Those of us of a certain age and with a certain taste in music might remember a song from way back called "Games People Play". I was struck by some of the lines in it. I will not sing it but the lines are:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_968">Games people play every day and night, </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_969">Never meaning what they say, never saying what they mean, </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_970">While they while away their hours in an ivory tower. </p>
          <p eId="para_971">That is the view of many Irish people when they come to look at the Oireachtas, that we are living in an ivory tower that does not bear much relationship to the reality of people's lives. When I was thinking of the topic of this Private Members' motion those lines kept going around in my mind. While we are in here do we say what we mean, do we mean what we say and when are we going to move out of that ivory tower and be more engaged with reality?</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> Private Members' time is an opportunity to stop and reflect on what kind of country we want to see develop and that we want to live in. It could be part of President Higgins's ethics initiative and the Houses, the Dáil and the Seanad, should have a debate on that topic also. There are two aspects to this Private Members' motion, one of which is philosophical. Politics sometimes neglects philosophy to its disadvantage. The philosophical debate is about our values, priorities and the principles we want to see that will guide our vision for our country for the future and that will guide us as to how we are going to bring about a more equal society.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> I have been here a relatively short time compared to others, just more than five years and I have been through a number of budgets. Each year a number of us call for a social impact analysis of budgets. As the motion states, we do not do adequate assessments of the impact of budgetary decisions. We are out of the official budget season, as such, even though we debated the Finance Bill earlier. At this time of the year there is an opportunity to consider other aspects when it comes to budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> The newspapers reported last week that the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - and the fiscal council as reported in today's newspapers - were all sounding alarm bells and making noises about additional measures and further cuts and macroeconomic adjustments. It is almost like they are saying there will be another austerity budget and more cuts. However, we must agree that, regardless of who is in power, there are sections of society which have borne the brunt of those cuts to date and they must be left out of any further equation on this and those sections of society which did not even know we were in a recession should contribute proportionately.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> Ireland has signed a number of international human rights treaties which means we are committed to human rights and dignity. In recessions and especially in times of cutbacks and austerity those human rights must be respected, protected and realised. Under international law, human rights covers certain categories. For example, States must do everything possible so that everyone in a jurisdiction has a basic level of subsistence to live in dignity. States must take account of the impact of cuts on the most vulnerable. The cuts must be effected in a non-discriminatory and a transparent way in consultation with affected groups. Because we have signed up to international human rights treaties, that is not optional, it is obligatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> In June 2015 Ireland will be examined under economic, social and cultural rights. The question is how we are we going to fare. Everybody wants to do well in an exam situation but there will be serious questions and serious concerns for Ireland. That makes it even more imperative that we take a human rights approach to budgeting, that we have adequate and meaningful impact assessments and that we have equality and gender-proofing. If there was a commitment to that, we would see much greater progress towards that equal society to which we are all committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> Ireland has a place on the United Nations Human Rights Council and we are a voice, and a respected one, for the human rights of those in the developing world but we are not always a consistent voice for the human rights of Irish citizens. The motion acknowledges there are signs of recovery and no doubt those on the Government side will point out all those signs of recovery. It is fantastic to hear about jobs being created in various parts of the country but - there is a but - when the Government talks about percentages and statistics indicating recovery, it is not always felt in an equitable way by all sections of society. The reality is that we have deprivation. There are people who do not have the necessities of life. An increasing number of people are homeless on the streets or in accommodation that is not conducive to dignity. If we walk anywhere in this city, and we need not go too far from these Houses, we will meet homeless people. On 11 November more than 168 people were sleeping rough in Dublin. Yesterday Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy of Focus Ireland said she has never seen the extent of homelessness and crisis in housing in all her years working on the issue as she is seeing now. It is an issue that is worsening every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> I want to deal with health inequality. I refer to a recent report completed at NUI Maynooth. It saw a disparity and inequality between those from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds and those at the other end of that spectrum. Recent data from it showed a fatality rate from cancer of 382 per 100,000 people in Blakestown compared with almost one third of that figure - 128 out of 100,000 - in Castleknock just a few miles away. The stage at which cancer is diagnosed has a huge impact on the outcome and again those in deprived areas tend to present later at a more advanced stage. The follow-up care is essential and again there are disparities. There are higher instances of cancers with lower rates of survival within more disadvantaged areas. The disparity holds across all stages of cancer even allowing for correction for certain lifestyle issues. The differences are very salient. I acknowledge the excellent cancer treatment we have in Ireland and the report stated that once inside acute services background has no impact on service, but the point is that there is an inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> There is also an inequality when it comes to addiction services. Those with private means and private health insurance can access residential treatment easily. If one does not have private means and private health insurance, the person in addiction will have to wait. Those who work with those in addiction know that when the motivation is high, that is the time to move into treatment. Those in addiction without means are sometimes put on a methadone programme but we have also seen that those in addiction can die while they are waiting to move into a residential treatment centre. One of the questions I pose is to whom does the Government listen when it comes to budgets and making decisions. What role do those in Irish civil society and the voluntary and community sector have, those organisations that know the reality and the real impact of budgets on families? We know budgets are not just about one day because their impacts are felt for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Organisations acknowledge the Department of Social Protection is the one Department that makes an effort to hear from affected people. Some of the organisations are invited to appear before the social protection committee and they then put recommendations to the Minister. Most organisations believe the process would be much improved if other committees, especially the finance committee, did the same and if they could have impact assessments on the effects any proposed changes would have on those likely to be adversely affected - if committees and Departments had information from civil society on the reality of the impacts and the implications, in other words, if they were committed to human rights being at the core of budgets. Many groups from all sectors of society make submissions but I have to ask are they worth the paper they are written on if there is no real engagement. We need to widen and promote genuine prebudget efforts from civil society because engagement to date has not been meaningful. We can look to Scotland's approach to equality budgeting as an example of good practice regarding transparency and equality proofing.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> I have another question related to the Economic Management Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Who do they talk to before budget decisions are made? Do they ever speak to anybody from the voluntary and community sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> We need a process for budgets, a human rights law framework, that is transparent, participatory and accountable in accordance with our duties and commitments under international law. We need, and Irish people deserve, budgets that are socially just and economically sustainable. The philosophies, socially just and economically sustainable, are not mutually exclusive. </p>

          <p eId="para_985">Following budget 2015, FLAC organised a seminar and survey of some 38 organisations in regard to where that budget lies in relation to human rights. The organisations with which FLAC consulted include Crosscare, Focus Ireland, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, the European Anti Poverty Network, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Alzheimer Society, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Age Action, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, Mental Health Reform, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, Amnesty International and the National Travellers Service, which is a good cross-section of organisations. Tá siad go léir ag obair ar son daoine ar an imeall agus le daoine ar an imeall. They know the real affects of budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> There were positives in the survey, including the increase in child benefit, funding for Tusla, the budget for social housing, the full retention of the free travel scheme and some progressive realisation for mental health and other measures, but there were not enough measures to address the housing crisis, rising rents, etc.. In response to the question, "Was the main issue you work on for your target group adequately allocated for financially in the budget", 76% of those organisations said "No". On the question, "Have the rights of vulnerable groups been properly respected and promoted in the budget", 49% said "No" and 43% said "to some extent". On the question, "How have human rights which your organisations work on been impacted on in Ireland since the recession", 65% said they were downgraded; 16% said there was no change; and 11% said they had been progressed. This indicates that austerity measures have seriously undermined all people's human rights in the last seven years, particularly vulnerable groups. In terms of hard evidence, income inequality has widened, consistent poverty has increased and child poverty has increased, particularly among children in low income households. We all know the situation in regard to homelessness. We know, too, that disability rights are not being recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> Given that there has not been a human rights approach to our budgets, certain sectors have been more affected, such as the communities about which I spoke earlier during Leaders' Questions. We are told that contractual arrangements for the powerful interests, individuals and groups could not be broken, yet cuts could be imposed on the most vulnerable in society. It is difficult for ordinary people to accept these cuts when there is little or no effect on the lifestyles of those whose greed and corruption caused the devastation. I do not know how Governments can stand over cuts to social spending and social protection programmes which have disproportionate effects on certain groups. </p>
          <p eId="para_988"> We are told we are moving out of the bailout and that there are signs of recovery. This means there is an opportunity now for us collectively, inside and outside the Dáil, to work on the development of a guiding vision for Ireland with, as mentioned in the motion, policy coherence at the core of all that we do. I am sure everybody will agree that the overwhelming majority of the organisations mentioned earlier work with the most marginalised and vulnerable. All of them agree that a human rights approach to budgeting will help to ensure a fair and more equal society. We are currently not a fair and equal society in that certain sections of our society are suffering disproportionately and unfairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> The motion calls for a reduction over successive future budgets in the income gap between social welfare rates and the income required for a minimally adequate standard of living. We are asking not that this reduction be achieved all at once but that a commitment be given to it being achieved gradually over a number of years. I do not understand how that cannot be accepted by the Government. I believe commitment and agreement to a human rights based budget could form part of a guiding vision for the future. Up to one hour ago I thought there would be no Government amendment to the motion. I thought we could agree on this motion which acknowledges recovery and all the positive work being done while pointing to the failings in this area. Unless we point out those failings, we will not be able to move ahead and address them. </p>
          <p eId="para_990"> The Government amendment states that detailed distributional impact analysis of tax changes is already included in budget documentation. To include something is one thing, but to do something about it is another. There is no commitment to equality in what is stated. The amendment also states that a social impact assessment will be carried out by a cross-departmental group but no details are given of the criteria or principles by which this will be guided and on whether account will be taken of the organisations to which I referred earlier who form part of front-line services to those who are most affected. The amendment also states that the Government is committed to a vision for Ireland which provides for economic and social recovery. Why can it not include "that economic and social recovery will contribute to a more equal and fair society"? </p>
          <p eId="para_991"> The Government has missed the essential aspect of this Private Members' motion, namely, a guiding vision for Ireland that will make a better Ireland, one that is more equitable and looks after those who are vulnerable and marginalised.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_992">I apologise in advance for having to leave the Chamber straight after my contribution but I have to attend a meeting. I also thank Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Finian McGrath for facilitating me in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on bringing forward this timely motion. I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is aware that 10 December 2014 is International Human Rights Day, which is the reason the Right2Water campaign decided on that date for the next demonstration against water charges. At the centre of that campaign is the belief, shared it is now clear by a huge number, if not the majority, of people in this country, that access to water is a human right. As indicated by the Taoiseach when he saw the scale of the recent protests, they are not only about water charges. He is right about that. In a way, this motion speaks to that fact. </p>
          <p eId="para_994"> For many people, water charges are the last straw. What runs behind this is the belief that this Government and the political establishment generally in this country and in Europe has lost its moral compass somewhere along the way and has forgotten the point of politics, the point of economics and the point of a society. This is not about balance sheets, deficits, debt targets and all the technocratic nonsense that is used to justify gross levels of unfairness, inequality, poverty and so on. What it should be about is what people need to exist a civil and dignified life and establishing the bottom lines for economic thinking, social policy and policy generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> The problem is that things are being done arse about face because in dictating policy and deciding economic priority, the Government starts not with what people need and what should be their basic rights, but with profit, balance sheets, debt, deficits, what the bond holders need, keeping the markets happy and keeping bond yields down, all of which does not mean anything to anybody. It is the wrong way to do things. The most basic right is access to water, which people physically need to exist. One could also say the same about housing. If people cannot have a roof over their heads, then frankly we should forget everything else. If 20% of the children in this country are living in poverty, then forget about social stability. Talk of economic recovery is utterly meaningless if 20% of our children are living in poverty and have to exist through their childhoods in poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> We must set bottom lines, which must include the right to water, the right to housing, the right of children not to live in poverty and the right to access to education up to third level, without obstacle, for anybody who needs it.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">These must be basic bottom lines. Everything else should come secondary, and be surplus, to that. That is the sentiment which is driving the popular mobilisation we will see manifest itself on the streets. If the Government is not willing to find its moral compass, we will see what human rights budgeting looks like in the demonstration on 10 December. While the Government talks about its bankrupt policies in this House, there will be a popular assembly outside it where people representing communities, civil society groups and trade unions the length and breadth of the country will have their own parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> If the Government bothers to listen to what is said on those protests, it will hear people start with the basic requirements for their children, for housing and for the right to access water without a price tag on it. Our human rights are not for sale. Access to water is not for sale and access to housing should not be for sale. That is what human rights budgeting is about and I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. Vindication of what she is trying to get across here will be seen on the streets of Dublin on 10 December and beyond.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_999">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate on the future of this country, the way we distribute the resources in our society and the urgent need to build a new Ireland, built on equality and social justice. I commend and thank my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, on bringing forward this motion, on bringing us all together and on putting forward a reasonable and sensible view of Irish society. If the Government is serious about economic disadvantage, social inclusion and building a better Ireland, it will support this motion and accept the proposals in it. That is the key issue in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> Before I deal with the specific proposals, it is important the Minister listens and deals with the huge problems in the wider society in 2014. Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned that 20% of children live in poverty but the figure is actually 28%. That is a figure at which one must look straight in the eye. It means a ruined childhood for many children. Within that group, one has extremely disadvantaged pupils and those coming from very poor and extremely dysfunctional families, which are often violent. If we do not act in this regard, these young children will be on their way to Mountjoy jail. The Minister should listen to the proposals in this debate because if we do not act and build a more inclusive and equitable society, many of these young children will be lost forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> Cutting funding to community-based projects, in particular on the north side of Dublin, is not acceptable and that is the bottom line. When I look at the figures in regard to the cuts being made, I am really saddened and annoyed by the amount of money involved. There is a crèche in Darndale currently which is providing an excellent service for many young children. The amount of money it is seeking in order to survive is in the region of €150,000 to €200,000. Compare that with the millions and billions of euro talked about in the Dáil every day. That project is doing a fantastic job but it needs a leg up, support and these kinds of issues to be dealt with by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> Currently, insufficient human rights aspects are included in budgets, which shows Ireland is not in line with the UN Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee's minimal core requirements. Other than the Department of Social Protection, no other Department carries out a social impact analysis and thus no adequate assessment on the impact of budgetary decisions. The current process of forming budgets does not involve evidence-based discussions. The motion talks about the lack of engagement by the Economic Management Council with the voluntary community sector. It is missing a valuable resource in the wider community and is missing ideas about solving many of the problems. That is a huge issue and the Government needs to listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> A resource often ignored in this House is people with a disability. People with a disability in the Ireland of 2014 play a vital role in society and that should be accepted. However, 45% of people with a disability experience income poverty while 36% experience basic deprivation. Households headed by people with disability are twice as likely to experience unemployment as those headed by a person without a disability. This issue cannot go unaddressed if we are to reduce poverty in Ireland. Half of those living in jobless households are either children or adults with a disability. People with a disability must not become the new underclass of workers and must be afforded an adequate working wage. Let us hope the cuts in funding to respite day care and residential places stop because they are not sustainable. I hope that with the extra revenue, that will not happen. The reality is that many people are feeling these cuts in funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> I call on the Government to ensure all people with a disability are guaranteed a quality service as a right. The Government should end all cuts to front-line services. Only yesterday I received a call from a family using the St. Michael's House service. Their daughter's transport to a particular service on the north side of Dublin is being cut. I had another case recently of a severely physically disabled young man who has no power from the neck down and who had a five-day service in the Central Remedial Clinic which was cut back to three days. Where are we going? What kind of society do we want? We need to end the cuts to front-line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> I said previously to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that there are many people in our society with a disability and that there is a huge network of people and tens of thousands of families affected. I would love to see a senior Minister with a dedicated responsibility for disability inclusion. That would go a long way to providing the kinds of principles and vision included in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> The Minister and the Government should prioritise funding for disability services in line with the solemn pre-election commitments in regard to disability made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. They should also pursue implementation of agreed measures, targets and timelines for these disability services. There is a group of talented people with a disability who are being excluded. Many services have been hammered over the past four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> I strongly support the call that the income gap between the basic social welfare rates and the income required for a minimum and adequate standard of living be narrowed in each year's budget. Before the publication of budgets, the impact of them on people should be analysed in a social impact survey which should be completed by a cross-departmental body. We should recommend the minimal core requirements set out by the UN Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee. We should have a guiding vision for Ireland which would ensure coherence at the core of public policy and a commitment to the common good. </p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> We will all jump up and down over the next year and a half and talk about commemorating the 1916 Rising but would taking on board the proposals put forward by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Technical Group and doing something about these issues not be an excellent project over the next 18 months? Then we could march around the GPO in 2016 and say we did something about poverty, economic disadvantage and people with a disability. That would be honouring the men and women of 1916 rather than prancing around and letting on that everything is hunky-dory. </p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> This debate is an opportunity for us to use wealth and resources on the more needy in Irish society. We saw the tax breaks for people on high salaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">We could have made other choices. We should look closely at that. Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan’s motion is in line with the Tony Gregory tradition. The late great Tony Gregory fought for more than 26 years on educational, social and economic disadvantage. These are issues that people could rally around to do something over the next year and a half if we are really to honour the men and women of 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> It is important that the Government listen to the proposals. For those who every now and again have a go at Independent Deputies and ask what they stand for, this is an example. There is a vision for the country and a sense of social justice in this motion. It concerns the future of the country, social justice and building a new Ireland on the basis of equality and social inclusion. If we implement the proposals in this motion, we can travel a long way and bring in a fairer and more equal society, but above all we can do something for the people who urgently need our help, whether they are homeless, people with disabilities, or those earning a wage that cannot put enough food on the table. These are the kinds of people we should stand up for in the Dáil. I urge all Deputies to support Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan’s motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I congratulate Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan on proposing her motion. It is powerful and timely when Ireland is hopefully beginning to come through the crisis that has beset us. I am very proud as a Member of Dáil Éireann to sign the motion supporting Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> The motion before the House calls for three things: a change in how we view social protection so that those who have to avail of social protection, for which they have paid, can live with dignity while trying to find a new job and recover from whatever has beset them; for a socio-economic impact analysis of budgetary decisions, something I have advocated since I was fortunate enough to be elected to the House in 2011; and for a vision which would ensure coherence in public policy decisions around the common good. All of these proposals should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> The issue of social protection is one for debate. I do not quite know the right answer but there should be a debate in the Oireachtas and publicly. As it stands, if one loses one’s job, one has to survive on €188 a week, regardless of one’s situation and how much one needs to live with dignity. That is an Irish solution. There are other countries in the eurozone and around the world which have a different approach to social protection. One pays in at whatever rate is agreed and if one is unfortunate enough to lose one’s job through sickness or whatever, one gets a replacement rate or close to that. It falls off over time which is a healthy incentive to get a new job. It means one does not fall into arrears on one’s mortgage and does not have to hide from the children the reason they cannot have a particular food, all of those awful changes that people, parents and families have to make when somebody loses his or her job. The rate of social protection insurance, pay related social insurance, PRSI, in this country is low. There is a debate to be had nationally which says the current rate of social protection more or less pays for €188 a week if one loses one’s job, but do we as a nation want to pay more? Do we want to move to a model whereby the amount will have to go up but if one loses one’s job one will continue to live in dignity while finding a new job? I would prefer that system for myself and for everybody I know. It is a choice. This Government and the Labour Party could take a real leadership role in holding that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> This extends to the State pension, which is a subsistence pension. We do not pay in enough. The policy of contributions through one’s lifetime is not enough. We are going to hit a pensions crisis. That is beginning as private pension funds fail. We will hit it in the public sector as well when the worker to pensioner rate moves from 5:1 as it is now to approximately 2:1, which will happen over the next 25 or 30 years. There will not be enough money out of current taxation to pay for all the State pensions. It is not just a private pensions issue. I would very much favour an opt-in policy whereby one’s PRSI will go up but a private pension might not be needed because one would pay into a pension at a higher rate, and could check it at any age by logging into an account to see where the fund is. It would be important to have a conversation about that and I wholeheartedly agree with what Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan says in the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> The motion also calls for analysis on the effect of budgetary impact on budgets and other policies. I have been calling for that for several years. After budget 2012 had been passed, I asked a guy I know in the Department of Social Protection who had been hit really badly. Obviously everyone had been hit because we were in the middle of a crisis and there were tough decisions to be made. I asked him had anyone been wiped out by the budget. He said lone parents had been. He said the Government was introducing a Bill which brought down lone parent support by reducing the age of the child from 18. It has come down every year to seven or eight now. He said that Bill was designed when Fianna Fáil was in government, when there was full employment and a single mum or dad could quite easily find a part-time job. The thinking was if the kids were out at school from nine in the morning till 3 o’clock, there was no reason for the parent not to go out and earn some money, and therefore the lone parent supplement could be reduced. The guy I spoke to said the legislation was never envisaged for a time when there was no work for these parents. That has been done in several areas with the result that the number of lone parents and children living in deprivation has gone up from one in four to one in two.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> That is an example of why we need the kind of analysis we are not getting. There is a report I have cited in the House before that examined Ireland’s budgetary process and concluded it was one of the worst. On a score of one to ten on the quality of data given to parliamentarians to interrogate budget proposals and the time given to them to consider the budgets before voting, we scored zero out of ten. Before this debate we were debating Report Stage of the Finance Bill 2014. What is the distributional impact of the Finance Bill 2014 throughout the country? We do not know. What are its gender, geographic and age impacts? We do not know. Are there any small or vulnerable groups that have been hit particularly hard and disproportionately by the Finance Bill? We do not know. Report Stage of the Bill will be guillotined tomorrow and the Government party Deputies will vote for it. They will vote on things on which they do not have sufficient information to make those decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> We rely on organisations such as the Economic and Social Research Institute. Deputy Tuffy and I have had a public debate on whether previous budgets were progressive or regressive. Deputy Tuffy believes they are progressive and cited ESRI research and voted for them accordingly. I have seen other ESRI research that showed they were regressive and accordingly I opposed them. If Labour Deputies had analysis that showed that the previous budgets were regressive and did these kinds of things to vulnerable groups such as lone parents, while they might not have voted against them, they would have applied a lot of pressure behind the scenes to improve the budgets. They cannot do that without the correct information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I hope this is something that can be improved. I note with cautious optimism that the Government amendment says that "a social impact assessment of the main taxation and welfare measures will be carried out by a cross-Department body". I do not know whether that is full equality budgeting. We will wait to see what the Tánaiste has to say. I am glad to see that something is happening, at least. If the Tánaiste is leading on the work involved in putting this process in place-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1021">-----perhaps she can examine whether it will be possible in future years for information to be provided to the House and to the public on the same day as the budget. If that were done, it would inform those who are considering the finance and social welfare Bills on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> The last line of the amendment says that the Government "is committed to a vision for Ireland which provides for economic and social recovery and focuses on measures which will assist people to return to work, continue to build consumer confidence and strengthen demand in the domestic economy". It is very important to focus on increasing employment rates. It is interesting that the other two areas of policy measure that are mentioned are consumer confidence and domestic demand. It is great that we will have policies to help people get back to work, but something is lacking when an amendment to a motion that is about equality and human rights refers to increasing consumer confidence and domestic demand - basically, helping people to buy more stuff. It is just a reflection. Perhaps it is time for the Government to broaden its thinking beyond economic recovery to other things like the rights and equality issues referred to in the motion before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">I acknowledge the positive elements of the Private Members' motion before the House. I will discuss the elements of it that I do not think reflect what actually happened in the budget. This debate gives us an opportunity to discuss an important aspect of the making of budgets. The motion acknowledges the "positive signs of economic recovery" and "the social impact analysis and the pre-budget consultations carried out by the Department of Social Protection". I am sure Deputies are aware that as Minister for Social Protection, I have significantly expanded the pre-budget consultation to involve more groups and made the social impact analysis much more detailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> I will refer briefly to the famous ESRI SWITCH analysis models. As Deputy Donnelly will know, they have been around for a very long time in the Irish situation. They probably constitute the best-known form of budgetary analysis. For a number of years, the immediate post-budget analysis has included the initial results of the SWITCH model, which measures the direct impact of tax and social welfare measures on the distribution of income. I emphasise in the context of this debate that the model measures the impact of budgetary measures in that way. If we are to debate the model, it is important to emphasise at the outset that many things are not in the SWITCH model and certain things are in it. The most recent post-budget SWITCH analysis considered the combined impact of the 2015 budget and the introduction of water charges. While this analysis is very useful in tracking the impact of budgetary measures, its designers acknowledge it is a partial analysis that does not take account of everything that counts in terms of the overall impact of a budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> Most but not all of the tax and benefit measures in last month's budget were included in the SWITCH analysis. A number of key measures were excluded from it. The model is the model. The ESRI chose the measures. The back to work family dividend was among the items that were excluded. When the dividend comes into effect, it will be worth €30 a week in respect of the social welfare payment per child. The qualified child increase will be worth €90 a week to a family with three children when someone moves back to work. As Deputies will appreciate, it is a significant back to work incentive. The effective abolition of the bank levy was also excluded from the SWITCH analysis. Deputies will recall that the bank levy was levied at 0.6% essentially on people in defined benefit schemes. It was a significant contribution to economic recovery by pensioners who rely on their defined benefit incomes. Its abolition, which was not included in the SWITCH model this year, is potentially of enormous significance for those pensioners depending on how their trustees treated the pension levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> The effect of some other budgetary measures, such as the water tax credit and fuel allowances, was estimated in the SWITCH analysis. As Deputies will be aware, the water charges have now been capped and significantly reduced. The credit is now the water conservation grant. It has been changed very significantly. In effect, it is now a universal €100 payment to householders who apply. It is clear that consideration of the revised water charges package, which includes a significant reduction of over one quarter in the gross charges and a more substantial mitigating measure in the form of the water conservation grant, would alter the initial SWITCH results. While these exclusions or estimates are likely to make a significant difference, other more fundamental factors are also important in judging the merits of the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> While the social welfare package in the budget is important in scale and design - it is worth almost €200 million and provides for the first increase in social welfare rates since 2009 - it accounts for less than one third of the expenditure measures in the budget. The large increase in the health budget, which involved the allocation of over €300 million in additional resources, was excluded from the SWITCH analysis. The Deputies who mentioned the UN guidelines will be aware that access to health resources is seen by the UN as being of critical importance in terms of human well-being. The €2.2 billion social housing programme, which will increase expenditure on public housing to €800 million in 2015, was also excluded from the SWITCH analysis. This programme will have huge implications for the well-being of communities that will be affected by the provision of additional housing. The expenditure of €800 million will also produce benefits for employment and the economy. It will enable people to go back to work and stimulate spending in the economy. The SWITCH analysis does not seek to capture any of that because it measures precise items.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> The increase in education spending, which will fund an additional 1,700 new full-time posts, 920 mainstream teachers, 480 resource teachers and 365 special needs assistants, is also excluded from the SWITCH analysis. Its designers acknowledge that the SWITCH model measures first-round effects only, and does not consider their impact on the labour market. Clearly, the goal of getting people back to work is absolutely central to my involvement in the budgetary process. Similarly, the SWITCH model does not consider the stimulus effect on the economy in general. In this context, the design of the budget and the scale of the adjustment are of vital importance. We need to consider the impact on the economy of the 2015 budget, which put over €1 billion of spending power back into the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">It included in its design a number of reforms designed to help the unemployed return to work, to facilitate the transfer of land to young farmers and to support small family business. These measures will boost potential growth, increase employment and generate a significant social dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> Contrast this with the Fianna Fáil budgets from October 2008 to April 2009, which took €9.5 billion out of an economy that was in free fall following the bursting of the property bubble that Fianna Fáil had done so much to inflate. In particular, it is worth considering the October 2008 budget. It relied mainly on income tax increases and levies - later replaced by the USC - and cuts to public sector pay. While these measures hit the better off hardest, they also had a devastating impact on the incomes of low and middle-income families. Fianna Fáil is not present at the moment, but it is surely cold comfort to those who are barely keeping their heads above water to hear that those on the highest incomes were taking a bigger hit. This is one of the problems with recent analysis because, while that may have been the case in 2009, the 2010 and 2011 Fianna Fáil budgets were unquestionably regressive. They included, for example, across-the-board cuts in social welfare rates of 8%. Fianna Fáil cut the carer's allowance, the blind pension, the widow's pension, the Christmas bonus and child benefit and unilaterally imposed pay cuts on public servants totalling more than 14% in February and December 2009. As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan knows, the cuts in quite a number of the weekly social welfare rates amounted to more than €16 per week. People ask me why I emphasise the weekly rates. The answer is that, for the people who rely on social welfare whom I represent and with whom I deal, this weekly rate cut was staggering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> Contrast this with Labour's record of protecting core social welfare rates, targeting increases this year - the living alone allowance and the Christmas bonus, which I am happy to say will commence being paid next week - and reducing, then cutting outright, the impact of USC this year, in which regard we removed a further 80,000 people from the net and reduced the first two rates of USC by 0.5% each. Let us be fair. By all means, count all of the measures that make up a budget, but please measure everything that counts in judging its fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> A more considered judgment on the impact of a budget on the economy and on income distribution in particular can only be undertaken with the passage of time and after direct and second round effects have been worked through. Such analysis was undertaken by Professor John FitzGerald and published in the ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary during the summer. He used a measure of income inequality known as - I have had to come to terms with its name in recent years - the Gini coefficient, involving before and after tax and social welfare measures in the period from 2005 to 2012. He concluded: "As discussed above, the effect of public policy in Ireland, acting through the tax and welfare systems, has been to produce a significant fall in the Gini coefficient." I am sure the coefficient is famous among economists and that Deputy Donnelly is familiar with it, having taken many classes on it. It measures fairness and the levels of equality and inequality in society. Internationally, it is reckoned to be the best measure of fairness. This is the reason I have raised it. The effect of public policy has been to produce a significant fall. I hope I am right in stating that, if the Gini coefficient is zero, it means there is an equality of income across society. The higher the coefficient, the more unequal that spread becomes. The Department and the ESRI are working with line Departments to improve the capacity of the ESRI's SWITCH model.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> I strongly believe in the kind of consultation that is outlined in the motion. As a Minister, consultation has been of great benefit. Sometimes, the process can be difficult. One is sitting down with individuals or organisations that find some of the things that have happened extraordinarily difficult to bear. I understand why. My job as Minister is to help to reconstruct the economy and assist those in the most difficult situations to recover. It has taken a great deal of time, particularly given the difficulties in the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> The Secretary General of my Department has written to all Departments to encourage them to undertake similar social impact assessments on budgetary measures. In addition, my Department has provided additional funding to the ESRI to improve the capacity of the SWITCH model. Indeed, it was one of the first measures I sought upon becoming Minister. This kind of economic analysis is important, but it does not mention everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> The Department publishes an integrated social impact assessment of the budget that includes the main welfare and tax measures. Its purpose is to inform public understanding on the cumulative effect of budgetary welfare and tax policies on income distribution and social equality. Unfortunately, due to the requirements of budget confidentiality, it is not possible to publish in advance the results of the analysis. Deputy Donnelly has raised this point. Perhaps the committee system should consider using the analysis as a serious tool for its own work. There is a great deal of scope in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> The Department has examined the impact of the main welfare budgetary measures that were announced on budget day 2015. I was elected leader of the Labour Party on 4 July. From 8 a.m. that morning until 1.30 p.m., when I am afraid my curiosity about the count in the leadership contest got the better of my desire to stay for longer at the pre-budget forum, I spent time with a significant number of organisations that every Deputy would be familiar with, for example, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and organisations representing carers, families, older people, the unemployed, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> According to our social analysis, there has been a larger impact on the bottom two quintiles of approximately 0.6%, some three times the average gain. The gain for the middle and top quintiles is smaller at 0.1% to 0.2%. The largest impact for families is among non-earning couples with children at 0.9% and lone parents at 0.8%, followed by the single retired at 0.7%. The smallest gains are among working households without children. The distribution of the additional welfare expenditure is concentrated on the bottom two quintiles, accounting for 57% of the total extra spend. This is twice the share going to the top two quintiles at 27%. The percentage of the population at risk of poverty will fall as a consequence of the welfare measures by more than 0.1%, rising to over 0.2% for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The response of the Opposition understandably might be to ask why the Government could not do more. It was limited and restricted in the amount of the package it could deliver on both the tax and social welfare sides. Members will have seen this morning the analysis of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. While its primary advice to the Government was to go for the deficit target, which it reached, it also repeated today that the Government really should have opted potentially for a further €2 billion in cuts. There are voices and that is why this debate on the budget is important and significant and Members should have the chance to look at all the advices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> I will mention some of the welfare measures contained in the budget, which include the back-to-work family dividend of €90 per week for people going back to work who have three children. The improvement in child benefit of €5 per month is small but significant. It usually is paid to the mother, as the caring parent, is paid universally and is not means tested. The living alone allowance was mentioned to me repeatedly by organisations representing older people and those with a disability and will increase from 1 January by €1.30 per week. The free travel scheme - another favourite item on the part of pensioners - was protected fully, while the top one was to keep intact the weekly rate of the pension. From next week, the Christmas bonus is being partially restored at a rate of 25%. This will benefit almost 1.2 million people, although those about whom we know most are pensioners and people with a disability. A pensioner couple should get something more than €100 and while this will not pay for Christmas, it will be a small help and a small step on the road to reconstruction and recovery.</p>

          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1058">First, I thank Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Donnelly and the Technical Group for tabling this motion, which is very good. It is rare that Members get the opportunity in the House to discuss something that really is about the fundamentals of who we are, how we allocate resources and how we have that discussion on who are the priorities and so on. As Deputy Donnelly will be aware - because we have discussed this previously - I have quite an interest in human rights, how they are implemented and how I perceive them playing their way in society. This motion is asking how to work in those universal human rights to which all Members have signed up and how should they be honoured and vindicated. It asks, as the language in legal texts would say, how should they be progressively realised and how can one ensure this is done in budgets. Consequently, I accept this is a good discussion to have. For instance, there is the argument that human rights and economic and social rights should be put into the Constitution, which they are at the moment, but by therefore making them legally binding. This is a genuine legal argument that takes place across Europe and is a matter for legal debate. I must admit I am not fully settled on it. One argument is that were one to so do, one first would be narrowing the pattern and the available space for democratic decision-making. For instance, if one states housing, health and education should be put as strict legal rights into the Constitution, someone who receives an electoral mandate from the people may be constricted and restricted in what he or she may be able to do. The argument is that one actually is placing the sovereign rights of the people possibly in abeyance or in conflict with the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> There is then, however, the issue of rights and the question of where one should do this. The motion before the House suggests questioning where do human rights come in when resources are being allocated. Before that point is reached, another value judgment would be to look at the market we operate in the State, at how resources are generated and how the resources actually come into play. The question is what should be those values. One would not be actually talking about how much money we have and how it should be spent in a rights context but about what policies we have at our heart that influence the markets, businesses and community around us that generate the wealth and then allow it to be distributed. This discussion is particularly important at present and I am delighted to discuss it, having come through seven years of absolute austerity and a really brutal time for the people and having seen what happened when free-market economics and light-touch regulation were the mainstream for the 14 years before that. It now matters what values we have in the economy and what values we have as a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> The first thing I would like to see in a value-based economy is that one would put workers at the heart of decision-making. I do not say this to be glib, as this actually means something. Over the years, it was not the work, it was speculation, who one knew, the golden circle, a clique and so forth that were making the decisions. Depending on to whom one listens, the economic priority should be business, it should be the most vulnerable - that is a phrase that has degraded public debate somewhat - it should be education and so on. However, for me the worker really should be at the heart of decision-making because one is talking about the man or woman who gets up every morning, brings the kids to school, gets out and works and creates the wealth that therefore allows us to do the nobler things in society that we wish to do. This is not what happened in the boom when we had what one might call a money-centred quick buck mentality. It was a time when the worth of someone's education and their endeavour as a human being by getting up every morning, going to work and producing was not what was important; it was how much was in one's pocket. The first thing that must be said is that those people who get up each morning to go to work must be at the centre of decision-making. This would require real action to implement and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, who is sitting beside me, will lead the charge in this regard, because the Government will be talking about living wages and those kinds of things that really matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> Having put the worker at the centre of the economy, the second thing is for Ireland as a State and as a people to get real about the social contract and to understand it. This also feeds into the motion because if one wishes to measure the economic and social rights as they are being vindicated, namely, education, health and so forth, unless we have a real and meaningful understanding of what are public services, how they are funded, what they mean in society and the central role they play, we will not be able to implement the rights about which we are talking. The reason I am in the Labour Party is that I am a social democrat and believe strongly that all people, no matter who they are, where they are from or what is their background, deserve the chance to prosper and thrive in society and not to be disabled by their backgrounds or their abilities. Ireland has never got to grips with a value judgment as to where we are. In the famous comment that Mary Harney made many years ago and which informed the debates, are we Boston or Berlin? Are we a low-tax, low-spending, no-service United States model or are we the Berlin model, which suggests each citizen has the right to participate? Until we, as a society, make that decision, the question will be whether we are going to resource our public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> Will we acknowledge that it costs money to provide the services? One cannot make election promises to increase spending and cut taxes at the same time or to rely on unsustainable revenues from an industry that will not last. This matters and it is difficult to bring the Irish psyche around to the proposition that perhaps one must pay for something such as a proper health service, without being vilified as almost being a communist. To get public support for this will require people like me, my party, people who are close to the trade union movement and those working in them to acknowledge that if they expect people to put in their money - for which they have gone out and worked - to provide the public services that are needed, those services must be efficient and must provide value for money. One must be able to state we can stand over the money as it is spent and that is why the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, while it is quite a technical and bureaucratic Department, and rightly so, plays its role in ensuring efficient public services, which allow us to provide the platform, the facilities and the institutions that can provide the human rights and their advancement that we wish to see in our society. While this may be an unexpected link, it certainly is not a tenuous one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> The third point I will make is that when people pay taxes and get back services, that is a social wage. It matters and is about getting something. It is about people's belief and confidence that the tax they pay is not simply taken and gone but is something that is in their pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">They also believe that it is spent on the health service and within the education sector. It is not wasted but rather it is pooled with those moneys paid by their fellow citizens in order to achieve something greater. The value judgment made in this regard must be brought into the public debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> The fourth matter to which I wish to refer is also of value in the context of this debate. We are concerned here not just with the allocation of resources on a human rights basis but also with how those resources are generated. What happens in this regard comes down to the choices we make in the context of the market. Should we return to the previous model wherein the market values dominated moral values? I firmly believe that the decisions made in the past whereby issues relating to the housing bubble and the property market trumped the needs of couples who needed to buy homes were wrong. During the period to which I refer, someone who owned a few acres of land on the outskirts which was suddenly rezoned as a result of the desperate need for development land could become a millionaire overnight having contributed little or nothing in terms of productive value. This was perfectly acceptable and it allowed market values to trump a real social and economic need, namely, the right to housing. As a result of that to which I refer, couples were saddled with enormous debts. This is another example of human rights being subverted in the interests of the market and it is an area in respect of which we need to say that a rights-based approach to policy making really can have an impact on citizens and on their experience <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> I am of the view that my final point will accord with many of the proposals put forward by Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Donnelly. A report compiled for the French Government by Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi states that measuring an economy on the basis of GNP, GDP, debt ratios, deficits and so on will provide an indication of the economic outlook but it will not provide information on the well-being, fitness for purpose or happiness of citizens. If society is only measured on those bases, a state will never be in a position to progress the value of a person's experience, improve his or her family life or reduce the amount of time her or she spends commuting in his or her car. Neither will it be able to discover whether parents can bring their children to the cinema on a Friday evening. These are issues with matter to people and which are of value in the context of enhancing their family life. A great deal of work has been done in this regard and I am of the view that we, as a nation, should be examining the issues to which I refer in order that we might remeasure how we define progress. Information on growth rates, national wealth and public debt do not indicate how well the nation, families and individual citizens are doing. I am of the view that the considerations to which I refer really do matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> I thank the members of the Technical Group for putting forward the motion. This is a particularly important and valuable debate and I am glad to have had the opportunity to contribute to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to what I regard as a most important debate. This is the kind of debate in which we do not often have the chance to engage in the Chamber. The debate relates to the social impact of decisions made in this House. Those decisions are often assessed by way of statistical analysis and involve examining the position of different income groups and categories of citizens. At its heart, the motion involves assessing the impact of budgetary decisions made in the Dáil on the citizens who elected us and whom we are here to represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> In essence, the motion proposes that any decisions that are made should be evidence based. Decisions which are made in this House, particularly in respect of financial issues, are not so based. Since I was elected to the Dáil in 2007, I have always been of the view that the process relating to the way budgets are framed and how budgetary decisions are assessed is dysfunctional. Budget day has been brought forward from December to October but we are still treated to the "big bang" announcement and the way in which the budget is framed remains the same. Various committees now engage in a series of pre-budget meetings but, to be frank, these represent nothing more than a box-ticking exercise. Like Deputy Donnelly, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. In July we invited a series of stakeholders with an interest in the budget to address us. We heard what they had to say and we may have given the impression that we could in some way shape and influence budgetary decisions. In reality, however, we could not do so. The practice of holding such meetings must be questioned. Members have no input whatsoever not only into the making of decisions but also in terms of assessing the options. That is a fundamental flaw in the way in which budgets are introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> This matter does not just relate to how budgets are introduced. The select committees meet to discuss the Estimates for the various Departments when the budget has been agreed. We go through the motions in the context of questioning the relevant Ministers on different elements of the budgets relating to their departmental Votes without having any capacity whatever to change the Estimates. As someone with a financial qualification, I find this a most bizarre way of doing business. However, we continue to allow it to remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> I accept that it will never be possible to achieve a consensus on what constitutes fairness. The motion has at its core the objective of achieving fairness in the way in which budgets are framed by ensuring that they are based on facts and evidence. In addition, the motion calls for a debate on what is the guiding vision for Ireland. This is a matter which the people and the political leaders who are charged with setting out the direction this country should take no longer discuss. When the Taoiseach discusses vision, he refers to Ireland being the best small country in the world in which to do business. In doing so he touches upon but one tiny portion of what constitutes a vision for the country. Such a vision must be based on enterprise and on rewarding those who take risks but it must also be based on the type of health system we want to develop, on equality of access to the education system whereby people from disadvantaged backgrounds will have the same right as everyone else to progress through that system, on seeing to it that adequate social supports are provided and on ensuring that there is a basic threshold of decency for every citizen. The vision for Ireland should focus on these and other issues. We do not debate this matter on a sufficiently frequent basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> Last week the members of the Select Sub-Committee on Finance debated Committee Stage of the Finance Bill with the Minister, Deputy Noonan. When Report Stage of that Bill was taken in the House earlier, Deputy Pearse Doherty pressed an amendment relating to equality budgeting to a vote. I welcome the fact that there seems to be some movement on the part of Government in respect of this matter. This is evidenced by the amendment to the motion, which refers to a greater analysis of the impact of budgets. The booklet relating to budget 2015 is in no way complete. I accept that it contains an assessment of how John and Mary and Seán and Joan are going to be affected by the budget but it does not capture all of the budgetary measures. For example, the water charges are not included. Last year, the doubling of the property tax was not included. This is because the budget booklet deals exclusively with the decisions announced on budget day. This does not capture the impact of the totality of Government decisions on the citizens we represent. That issue must be dealt with in order that we might engage in a wider assessment. This could be done either by expanding the SWITCH model or by identifying some other way in which we might obtain the type of analysis to which I refer and which is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> We must move beyond the situation whereby we are presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> on budget day. If we are to be mature in the context of how we do our business and if we are to implement the kind of reforms people want, then the type of charade which continues to mark the lead-up to budget day - namely, where the Government consistently leaks elements of the budget in order to manage expectations, where it flies kites in order to shape public opinion and where it influences public reaction to the budget - must be brought to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> I take issue with many of the comments made by the Tánaiste in response to the motion, particularly when I consider some of the measures that have been introduced by the Government. She is the very person who introduced a certain measure which had a disproportionate impact on women. I refer to the decision taken in late 2011 to change the eligibility criteria relating to the State pension. This involved a fundamental amendment to the average annual PRSI contribution band, which disproportionately affected women who left the workforce in order to raise their families. The decision to which I refer is now beginning to have an impact on many women. I will provide an example. A woman with an average of 30 weeks' worth of contributions per year of service was entitled to almost €30 more in her State pension before the change in question was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">That belies the notion being put forward by the Government that rates were not cut. They were cut but in a very sneaky and underhand way. That measure did significant damage to the future incomes of individuals, particularly women. Owing to the way in which entitlement to the State pension is calculated, based on the calculation of average PRSI contributions per year of service, somebody who entered the workforce for a few years in 1965, left the workforce for 15 or 20 years on getting married and then returned to employment ends up with a significantly lower pension than he or she would have had before the changes were introduced in budget 2012. These are the kinds of measures that need to be assessed because they have a very serious and negative impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> The changes for single parents have been discussed in the House on a number of occasions. I refer to the welfare supports and one-parent family payment, in addition to the tax relief. Earlier, I raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the change he introduced last year replacing the one-parent family tax credit with a single-person child carer credit. This took €2,500 out of the pockets of many parents. The overall effect is that many would have to earn double that amount, or €5,000, to have the equivalent of €2,500. These issues need to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> My overall view of equality is that people living in disadvantaged areas, including young people, find it much harder to make the breakthrough and make progress in society than such people 20 or 30 years ago. I speak from experience coming from a working-class background. I do not see as many young people from disadvantaged areas and lower socioeconomic groups making the breakthrough today. We must ask ourselves why this is the case. I genuinely believe the gap is getting greater. Those who have access to resources are making great strides and are availing of all of the benefits of living in a modern country where there are still great opportunities. There are others, however, who see few, if any, of those opportunities. That is one of the greatest challenges the country faces, and it will have a major impact on society. Why is it that a schoolchild living in certain parts of Dublin city or Cork city has a much diminished chance of progressing to third level, be it a university or institution offering a post-leaving certificate course? This is an indictment of all of us. We must address the issue because we are simply not getting it right. There is no equality in this country because there is no equality of opportunity. The various schemes that have been designed to help people from disadvantaged areas and those living in low-income households to make progress are not working to the extent that they should. They worked for people in previous generations but there is now an issue that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> I am disappointed with the Government's response to the motion. It refers to a number of specifics in its reply and it seems it is missing the broad thrust or spirit of what is being proposed by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and others in the Technical Group. The motion is to trigger a fundamental debate on the way we make decisions, the basis on which we make them and how we measure their impact. We are not doing this well enough but we must.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> I wish to comment on the priorities of the current Government because the Tánaiste took a number of political swipes at my party. At the first opportunity last month, when the Government had some resources at its disposal, it chose a tax package that disproportionately benefits higher income earners. There is a tax package of €405 million that goes to only one in six income earners – the earners of the highest incomes. That was the priority of the Government at a time when elderly people who should be in nursing homes are lying in hospital. They must wait four to five months to obtain funding under the fair deal scheme to get into a nursing home. This is a time when parents who know that their children have special needs cannot have those children assessed for many months. There are parents whose special needs children have been assessed but cannot avail of the range of intervention services that have been recommended. There are people in need of hip and knee replacements who are waiting four and five years in my city to have crucial medical intervention. That is not acceptable, yet at the first opportunity the Government had when it had resources at its disposal, it decided its number one priority was to design a tax package worth almost €500 million and give it to the top one in six income earners. These statistics have come from the Minister for Finance himself by way of a parliamentary reply. We can absolutely stand over them because they are factual.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> The Tánaiste's answer earlier seemed to be that we could give more work to the committees to tease out the impact of budgets. The reform of the committee system introduced by the Government, if one wants to call it reform, has left the system absolutely dysfunctional. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, for example, is overburdened with work. It simply cannot cope with it. The committee has 27 members.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">Can anyone tell me how it is possible for any committee with 27 members to work efficiently? Each member has the same mandate. I, as the finance spokesperson of my party, am lucky because I get an early opportunity to contribute and question witnesses at every meeting. However, others, such as Deputy Mathews, who want to make a contribution at meetings, cannot have their voice heard unless they are prepared to wait three or four hours. This is a direct result of the changes to the committee system that the Government introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> It is very easy for the Tánaiste to come into the House and talk about the very tough budgets that were introduced in the past. The budgets introduced by the late Brian Lenihan were extremely tough but it has been independently verified that, while they were extremely tough and contained really painful measures that affected all sectors of society, they were progressive in that their impact was felt far more by those who had the capacity to shoulder the burden. By contrast, the approach of the current Government has been to introduce regressive budgets that have placed the burden disproportionately on lower and middle-income groups. My overriding sense is that the Government's agenda, economically and otherwise, is absolutely dominated by Fine Gael. I wish I could say otherwise because I do not see evidence of the Labour Party input I had expected.</p>

          <p eId="para_1084">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Maureen O’Sullivan as ucht an rúin seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh díospóireacht againn arís ar an ábhar seo. Bhí díospóireacht againn níos luaithe sa Dáil faoi a leithéid de phróiseas i leith an bhuiséid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> Equality proofing and poverty proofing of major Government policies, not just the budget, should be built in. I am one of the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection who travelled to Scotland to examine how the equality budgeting system in the Scottish Parliament works. While it has its faults, it is something that we could consider. More is the pity that the Scottish vote for independence did not go the way I would have liked because it would have presented a challenge to the Scottish Parliament in terms of how it could have expanded the equality proofing of its budget to deal with taxation measures. That Parliament has not been granted power over these, no more than the Assembly in Stormont. There are challenges but they are not insurmountable, and those concerned have done great groundwork for this Government and others. While preparing for a budget, rather than after the fact, one could determine the impact that contemplated measures or changes in departmental Estimates would have on society in general. Equality proofing is to ensure the gap between the richest and poorest in society does not expand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> However, according to my politics, it should be decreasing continuously, budget after budget. If a government stands on a platform of reducing that gap, there should be a measure to show that effect has been seen on its budgetary measures. While some will quote the ESRI's recent report stating that the highest losses were for those in the highest 10% of household income category, which may be true, the highest income categories are those who have a higher disposable income and the impact of higher cuts were not felt as hard by them as by those who were on the lowest pay, those who were dependent on social welfare or low-income earners who had major outlays on mortgages, etc. In attempting to measure the impact of policy changes on different groups, it may be insufficient to consider the percentage changes in income alone. We need, for instance, to take into account the quality of life and welfare equality of different groups in society. There is a multitude of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> All legislation is already supposed to have a poverty impact assessment but it is not obligatory. We need to ensure that whatever measures are taken, it is not a voluntary code and they are implemented in full. In this debate, we also need to look at the concept of maximum income that has developed over years. It is not a new concept. The maximum income concept has been championed, for instance, in the bastion of capitalism in the United States, the US military, where the highest paid cannot earn ten times more than the lowest paid. In Japan, it is a lower figure. Even though there are huge corporations in Japan where one would presume the CEOs would be on a significant wage, they never earn ten times more than the lowest paid in the factory. That is something we need to consider here. This Government made some attempt at putting caps on some of the higher paid in society but it breached those caps quite regularly. It is something on which the Government needs to respond, and rather than producing an amendment to the motion that does not take on board the spirit of the motion from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, the Government should have adopted her motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> If one looks at the recent proposals on water charges which I heard the Minister champion earlier as a type of measure that will address inequality, in fact it does the opposite because the water conservation grant is the same whether one earns €1 million or is on social welfare.

          <p eId="para_1089">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1090"> That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to Standing Order 107E, shall consider the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges entitled 'Relevant report on the relevant proposal for a banking inquiry under Standing Orders and the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013', copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st November, 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">This report comes about under the Oireachtas inquiry system established by the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013. The Act, and the Standing Orders which flow from it, give the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, the responsibility for evaluating inquiry proposals, and making recommendations to the House. Such a report must be considered by the Dáil before the terms of reference are approved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> Given that this was the first time under the new Oireachtas inquiry system that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was called upon to evaluate such a relevant proposal, all steps were taken to be comprehensive in our approach. The committee met on four occasions to discuss the proposals and received expert advice and legal assistance in carrying out this function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> All too often some members of the media and some commentators like to play up the disputes that take place in the Dáil Chamber as a symptom of some problem with Irish democracy. All too rarely do these same members of the media and commentators focus on the productive work that takes place in the Oireachtas committees. In their work in Oireachtas committees, Deputies and Senators put aside their political differences to work together on legislation, on reports and on new initiatives such as pre-legislative scrutiny. I believe that, as a result of the reforms introduced in the Dáil, Oireachtas committees now play a more vital and central role in our Parliament than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> All the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, regardless of political background, approached this work in a professional way and engaged fully in the process. I acknowledge the work of all members of the CPP for that. The Chair of the committee, An Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Barrett, was determined to make sure that the committee fulfilled it role under the Act and Standing Orders. The Ceann Comhairle, the CPP members and the Oireachtas staff worked with the appropriate legal and expert advice to provide the Dáil with a complete and detailed report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> Following its consideration of the relevant proposal of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, the CPP considers that the proposed banking inquiry should be conducted; it should be conducted by the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, which has to date operated on the basis of consensus and has already acquired some expertise in regard to the matters proposed to be inquired into; it should be conducted as a section 7 inquiry under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 - this inquiry could add significant value and increase the public's understanding of what went wrong and help to prevent a repeat of the failed policies that led the crisis; the draft terms of reference resolution for the proposed inquiry should be amended slightly to consider the impact of membership of the euro and allow for additional categories of witness; and the necessary amendments should be made to the Central Bank Act 1942.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> The motion is an important next step in the establishment of the banking inquiry. It is only right that an Oireachtas inquiry review the different decisions, policies and systems that led to the bank guarantee and the financial crisis so as to make sure that we as a nation learn from the mistakes of the past and avoid repeating them in the future. I, and I am sure all members of the CPP and the Dáil, wish the members of the banking inquiry well in the task before them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1097">The Government Whip referred correctly to the important work of the CPP in this matter. I pay tribute to the work of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis because I believe it, too, has worked effectively and cohesively to date. That is why Fianna Fáil will co-operate with the banking inquiry which is now being established by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> We have stated all along that if the inquiry is to achieve its aim of a full examination of the events surrounding the banking collapse, it cannot focus solely on the night of the bank guarantee. It needs also to examine the lending culture which prevailed in the banks, the role of external auditors and advisers, the pressure brought to bear by the ECB not to impose losses on senior bondholders, and the decisions to establish NAMA and liquidate IBRC. We welcome the inclusion of these matters among its terms of reference and also the examination of the design flaws in the euro project itself as a factor in the subsequent difficulties Ireland and other countries endured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> However, we retain our view that the model chosen by the Government runs a real risk of providing an incomplete examination of these events. We have repeatedly stated that the Tribunal of Inquiry Bill 2005, if enacted, offers a cheaper, faster and more efficient method of investigating matters of urgent public concern where other private inquiry mechanisms, such as commissions of investigation, are inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> It is likely that the Irish people will not be satisfied with a parliamentary inquiry that cannot focus on individual wrongdoing and can only deal with institutional systems failure. It needs more than just a record and report summary. The potential of an Levenson-style inquiry, as in the United Kingdom, would allow a fully independent and public inquiry to take place. It is regrettable that the Government did not take our advice in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> For a Government that repeatedly expressed a desire to get to the root of issues surrounding the collapse of the banks, it has shown a remarkable level of ineptitude in bringing this about. There is now a real risk that the inquiry timetable will clash with the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">From having being central to the Government's re-election strategy, there is now a real risk that the inquiry will be jettisoned half way through its work in order to facilitate an early election which looks ever more likely. As well as identifying what happened during the banking collapse, deliverable proposals as to how to prevent a recurrence, building on the measures already implemented, could significantly enhance the work of the inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103"> We know that at some point in the late 1990s and early 2000s a significant cultural shift occurred in the Irish banking sector, which caused some previously prudent institutions to embark on what proved to be a reckless lending spree. Bank of Ireland, for example, took more than 200 years to accumulate €100 billion in lending, yet within another four years it had doubled its amount of loans. The bank loan losses did not simply occur in 2008 - the problem had been in the making for many years, probably as far back as 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> Few, if any, bankers put their hands up and voluntarily assumed responsibility for the credit bubble, either to bank shareholders or to the public who ultimately carried the can for the losses.</p>

          <p eId="para_1106">It is vital that we get an opportunity to understand the workings of the bank credit committees and what level of executive oversight of their work took place. Reports identifying responsibility for bank failures on the part of individuals and not just general systems failures have been prepared in several foreign jurisdictions and could serve as templates for an inquiry in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> Fianna Fáil fully acknowledges that the political background to this explosion of credit also needs to be examined, bearing in mind that at no stage, even during the debate on the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2003, did any political party call for the banks to rein in lending. In fact, at the time, the current Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton said, "IFSRA cannot be expected to ride shotgun with every bank. And banks have deep pockets to resource various wheezes. In the long run, only self-assessment will work, not trying to catch people out." That is very much at variance with what is being said today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108"> In terms of the role of the Central Bank, we must accept that unlike in other businesses, bank failures inflict widespread economic damage on third parties. That is the reason banks are licensed and regulated. The Honohan and Nyberg reports examined the performance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator. They concluded that there were serious failures of regulation and supervision, despite warnings about growing threats to financial stability. There were no calls from the political system to increase regulation or supervision, contrary to the attempts to rewrite history more recently. The Department of Finance was also judged in these reports to have acted in a way that was too little, too late. The reports assigned responsibility to institutions, rather than to individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> I wish to refer to the ECB in the little time remaining. Colm McCarthy said "The ECB, under its former president, Jean-Claude Trichet, consistently pursued policies that were helpful to bank creditors and unhelpful to taxpayers and sovereign bondholders." This policy position has now been effectively abandoned, both by eurozone politicians and by the leadership of the ECB. Any future bank rescues would be modelled on the Cypriot example with losses potentially being imposed on unsecured deposits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> All relevant correspondence between the Irish authorities and the ECB should be released to the inquiry. In addition, it would be appropriate for former ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, to appear before the inquiry to explain why the ECB set its face against the imposition of losses on senior bondholders, including unsecured, unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide even after the decision had been taken to close them down. The indication from Mr. Trichet that he will not appear and that instead Patrick Honohan will address the inquiry on behalf of the ECB is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1111">Cuirim fáilte roimh an gcoiste fiosrúcháin seo agus na téarmaí tagartha atáimid ag plé chun déanamh cinnte go mbeidh seans acu déileáil le ceist mhór na mbanc agus an teip iomlán a tharla ar an gcóras airgeadais sa tír seo thar na blianta deireanacha. Guím gach rath ar an gcoiste sin mar tá obair mhór roimhe. I welcome the terms of reference of the inquiry and I wish the inquiry well. The committee members have a significant job in front of them. I do not think any of them have shirked so far from it. In some ways I wish them well and that they will have the time and the timeframe within which to carry out their work. On the other hand, I hope they do not because I want a general election as soon as possible. However, the issues before the committee need to be investigated, and the committee must reach findings of fact. We must learn very specifically from what happened at that stage to ensure the mistakes of the period are never repeated or heaped upon future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> I am concerned at the delay in getting to this stage. We are more than three years into the Government’s term of office, which got elected on a promise that there would be a banking inquiry. We would be a lot better off if the inquiry was put in place in the first year of the Government’s term of office, but it fiddled and fumbled along the way. However, we are where we are and we must deal with the current situation. Even though there is a tight timeframe, the public has a wish and demand for findings of fact to be made about what went wrong. The public also wish to see the wrongdoers brought to justice. That is not in the terms of reference; that is for a court and the authorities outside of this House to deliver on. We must ensure we do not set the expectations of the public too high. Nobody will be held to account following the inquiry, but findings of fact will be made and people will be able to draw their own conclusions. Perhaps those findings of fact would be useful in court proceedings in the future. Given where we are today, at the very least we must ensure that the breaches of regulations, the obscene greed that characterised that period of the property bubble among some in banking and property speculation in the State, is never replicated and that brakes are put in place. Those brakes can be legislated for in this House, based on the findings of the committee. Some of the brakes are in place but they are not enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> There are serious constraints on the committee in terms of its workload. They will be in the bunker morning, noon and night for the next six months at least trying to extract the teeth of what went wrong from people who to date have not been as forthcoming as they should have been, and why there was a different approach to the Irish banking collapse than to other countries in Europe. Perhaps such information could also be gleaned. We must establish why it took so long to react, why the rules, laws and guidelines that were in place were ignored and continuously ignored and not implemented. Unfortunately, some of the arrogance that characterised that period has begun to creep in again. We, as politicians in this House, must send out the message that we will do our damnedest to ensure the situation does not reach the heights it gained previously and that we will put a brake on that type of speculation and gambling with people’s lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> We know that €64 billion was put into the banks. One of the things we cannot fully quantify is the effect not only on people in Ireland but also on all of those who had to emigrate as a consequence. Many families had to go through the trauma of repossessions or very constrained financial situations. That is something I hope the committee members have at the back of their mind. I hope everyone who is called before the committee to give evidence will remember that their evidence covers a period that will have a consequence on the life of every man, woman and child in Ireland for many generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">The committee members and those who will be coming before it will need to be honest and upfront and will need to endeavour to help society to learn the lessons from that period in order that we can be helped to frame a better future.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1116">I have no objection in principle to a banking inquiry to find out what happened during the critical period which this inquiry is examining as this could be very necessary and very useful in preventing it happening again. However, I have some serious reservations about this inquiry, its composition and its terms of reference. There are serious credibility difficulties attached to politicians investigating politicians. We have seen this in this House before on various issues where serious mistakes have been made, and I would hate to see it done again. I see nothing wrong with politicians carrying out inquiries into matters about which they can be objective, but the idea that politicians in this House, myself included, can go into an inquiry and suddenly throw away their political feelings and motivations and the fact that they are politically compromised when they go into this Chamber beggars belief and asks too much of those whose careers depend upon political patronage and favour and being members of a political team. I do not believe that this inquiry will fulfil that particular objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> Bankers, auditors and, hopefully, nearly all the players in this sphere will appear, but there will be a completely different dynamic to this inquiry when the theatre opens and former members of the regime which sat at the time of the banking guarantee appear. It would be beyond human endurance or belief to expect members of the Government parties to appear in this inquiry and be soft, fair or objective towards the Fianna Fáil or Green Party players who were part of that scene.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> Equally, it would be very unfair, or perhaps unrealistic rather than unfair, to expect the Independent Members not to score political points in this inquiry. We all know that is what will happen because it will be very difficult for them to resist and I suggest they will not. It is a pity the composition of this inquiry consists of politicians whose careers very much depend upon the fact that, at the very least, they should excel and their opponents should not excel in public performances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> The inquiry is flawed in that way and it is a pity that it will have a Government majority in its membership. With all due respect to the Chairman of the inquiry, who is in the Chamber, it would have been better if the Chairman was not a member of one of the governing parties. I have great respect for Deputy Ciarán Lynch and for everything he does but it would be better if it were not a member of the governing parties or any politician presiding over this inquiry. He will be seen so often, whether he likes it or not, as wearing his Government hat and this committee will be seen as a Government-dominated committee, regardless of whether the Whip is officially used or not. That is the perception and I am afraid it is also the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120"> It has taken a very long time for this inquiry to be set up as more than six years have passed. As everybody knows, memories are dimming all the time and many will plead they do not remember what happened, and with justification. The credibility of this inquiry also suffers as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121"> It would be helpful, and it has some helpful roles to play, if instead of demonising the Government and the players of the past, this were to be left to another theatre and to other people. We looked at the present and asked if the situation had been cured, whether we have learned any lessons so far six years later. It seems to me that we do not need an inquiry to decide that little riddle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> I refer to the boards of the banks and it seems to me to be quite extraordinary that one of the solutions produced for the problems of 2008, especially the night of the guarantee and afterwards, was the role of public interest directors. I pay tribute to and lament the death of Joe Walsh who was a public interest director. Public interest directors are still sitting on the boards of banks, drawing very high salaries and are neither answerable nor accountable to anyone. They do not have meetings with the Minister for Finance, they are not subject to re-election and they are doing God knows what.</p>

          <p eId="para_1123">I am pleased to contribute to this debate. The people have experienced extraordinarily difficult times in recent years. In large part the causes are rooted in the financial meltdown triggered by the failure of the banking system. Despite the trauma inflicted, we still have not fully uncovered the truth of what happened in the banking system. Until the source of this crisis is fully examined, the people will not have the security of knowing that there will not be a repeat of the trauma they suffered. It is like walking away in a daze from a car crash but not knowing who or what caused the crash. The people want to know, they are entitled to know and there will be a benefit from knowing. It may be that we cannot fully move on without knowing. For the sake of the nation and of the people, we need the key actors in the financial crisis to explain their roles in public and to speak about their roles during the period in question. The banking inquiry will be a watershed moment when this truth is fully uncovered. The people must be given the truth and they must see that their public representatives can get to the truth on their behalf. Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas are here because they want to carry out public service and to use their skills in this area. The committee members have the skills to deal with the technical issues to which Deputy Ross referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> I was present in the House on the night of the debate on the legislation for the bank guarantee on 30 September 2008. The House was informed that night that the banks' assets were greater than the banks' liabilities by up to €100 billion. Despite this, the public ended up taking on board the banks' liabilities of up to €64 billion. We need to know why this happened. It is not sufficient to focus on the bank guarantee because we must examine the events that led up to the guarantee and the consequences for the people of the financial crisis afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> I commend the Government on introducing legislation to permit parliamentary inquiries to take place with the benefit of investigation and compellability. My colleagues, under the chairmanship of Deputy Lynch, will show that it is the most efficient and appropriate forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">It will get to the truth on behalf of the Irish people, who are entitled to no less.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T21:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1127">Much work has been done by the committee in getting to this point. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has had a number of meetings and has gone through the proposal and the amendments in considerable detail. One of the amendments, with regard to the euro project, is incredibly important. Deputy O'Donnell spoke about what led up to the guarantee and the euro project is central to it. It is important that it is part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128"> We must ask ourselves what we want from the banking inquiry and most definitely we need to learn lessons as otherwise we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. We need to do more than this; we must see how we can strengthen our hand with regard to our relationship with the European Union, particularly with the ECB. The ECB seems to want it every way. It wanted the benefit of low interest rates and big economies, flooding the banking systems of countries such as Ireland with cheap money, but it was very capable of breaking its own rules, particularly in permitting IOUs to be written in the form of promissory notes. We have been utterly short-changed in this regard, and I want to see major attention on this issue because much more on this could be played out if we, as a country, have the courage to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> There are downsides to the banking inquiry, including that those who will sit on it on our behalf will have to give it 100% attention. It will take a great deal of time and effort, and it will not be a question of being able to go in and out. We are asking them to do this in the run-up to a general election. This is a tall order for people who exist in a politically competitive environment and we should not underestimate exactly how difficult this will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> Another concern is the length of time it will take. I know it has a tight timeframe, but there is a presumption the Government will last for the duration, or at least until the end of next year, but I do not believe this is all that certain. We can count the number of Deputies in the Labour Party and Fine Gael, but we are now in a much more volatile environment and how long the Government will last is not something one can predetermine. We will expend a considerable amount of taxpayers' money on this work and there is the potential of serious criticism if a general election is called before the work is complete. We are taking a risk by launching the inquiry at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> There are lessons to be learned, but it is not enough merely to learn lessons. I stress the point that we need to pay particular attention to the European Union, in particular the ECB and what flowed from the Maastricht treaty. I wish those who will sit on the inquiry well. It will be a difficult task and not one without downsides.</p>

          <p eId="para_1133">I want to put on the record, for future reference so people will know what is happening here tonight, that we are discussing No. 18, a motion that Dáil Éireann shall consider a report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, entitled Relevant report on the relevant proposal for a banking inquiry under Standing Orders and the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013. When we complete this another motion will be tabled, on the terms of reference of the banking inquiry, but no debate on it whatever will take place in the House. I want to put down a marker that when somebody asks whether the terms of reference of the inquiry into the banking crisis were debated in the Chamber the answer will be "No" because No. 19 will be taken without debate. Is this a good way to do business?</p>

          <p eId="para_1135">Then, before we go home, No. 20 will be tabled. This is an amendment to the terms of reference of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, which also will be taken without debate. We will debate only No. 18. For the record, no debate will be held on the terms of reference of the banking inquiry, which people will find very strange, and there also will be no debate on the amendment of the terms of reference of the joint committee. The Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis has been established and it has produced a report. Until this point, its terms of reference have only allowed it to produce a report on how to get the business up and running. No. 20, a motion on the amended terms of reference of the committee, which begins on page 1902 of the Dáil Order Paper of today, will not be debated this evening. It is important these procedural matters are right in the interests of conducting the inquiry. I hope the fact no debate will take place will not in some way go against the inquiry down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> Everybody knows there is a need for a full inquiry and everybody I know supports it. Fianna Fáil will support it and will fully co-operate with it. I am speaking not only about current members of the parliamentary party, but also about former members, who will fully co-operate with this approach. We must ask ourselves about the genesis of the three motions before the House and it is very clear. The Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Houses of the Oireachtas Inquiries) Bill went before the public by way of referendum in November 2011 and it was defeated. The people stated they did not want politicians in Oireachtas Éireann carrying out this inquiry. What did the Government do? It did not listen. It came back with plan B, which was to do it anyway regardless of what the people stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 was passed in the Dáil on 3 July 2013. It is very important to state for the record and for anyone listening that the committee received no new constitutional powers compared to previous committees. The committee has not one scintilla more power over and above the famous Abbeylara inquiry. There has been no change to the Constitution and the Oireachtas has no more powers. No matter how powerful it is, the committee can make no findings which can impinge on the character or reputation of an individual. We are dealing with legislation for an Abbeylara-style committee, and all the talk in the Chamber about changing legislation does not change the constitutional framework under which we operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> The Oireachtas has already shown serious bias when the Taoiseach spoke about an axis of collusion between my party and a particular bank. We have always said we believe the most appropriate way to deal with an inquiry is a Leveson-type inquiry carried out by an independent judge. We saw on our television screens that it worked very well in England. It is the best model. It is the model in which the public has trust. The public does not trust politicians to act fairly and impartially in this. That said, it is the only show in town to get some information, and for that reason Fianna Fáil will co-operate fully and thoroughly with every aspect of it. Another route should have been taken, but the Government chose not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> The people of Ireland will rightly ask how much this will cost. The motion before us should have given an estimate of the cost to be incurred by the Irish taxpayer, and the Dáil should not give a blank cheque for the inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">A financial motion should be attached outlining a budget and if it is exceeded they should at least come back on a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> I wish the inquiry well, but it only represents the Government's plan B. It was never its first choice and it is nobody's first choice. It is not the public's desired way of doing business. They said "No" to the Oireachtas doing inquiries in a referendum, but the Government is proceeding with its own Government majority and its own Government Chair. Despite all the shortcomings, Fianna Fáil will fully co-operate with that inquiry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1142">I wish the people doing the work here well, but we should ask a fundamental question. Whom is this inquiry for? It is for the people of Ireland. It is for the 1.5 million people whose lives have been ripped apart and turned inside out, 500,000 of whom are abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> The circumstances, the pathology of what happened, are very simple. We do not need to get expert lawyers or expert forensic accountants; plain balance sheet analysis will do it. Seven years from 2001 to 2008 explains it all. Our domestic banking system grew from three times national income to 5.5 times national income - that is a credit Ponzi scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> Who is in charge of all the banks, whether Irish banks or foreign-owned banks, in the domestic banking economy? The boards of directors are. We had a motion supported by Fianna Fáil, all other Opposition parties and Independent Deputies, stating that the terms of reference should start with a review of the balance sheets of the licensed deposit-taking banks from 2001 to 2008 and that the men and women who were on the boards of directors for those years should be asked to attend and just listen to the narrative of what the balance sheets tell us. They grew at a phenomenal, stupid rate. They grew because the funding was stupid. It is not possible to have stupid lending without having stupid funding. One cannot drive a car somewhere unless one has the fuel - that is the funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> So we do not need esoteric and obtuse-type thinking. We need to be honest to the people of Ireland and get all those men and women, who were on the boards of the banks during those years, to just attend in an assembly, like a school assembly. We then need to talk them through the balance sheets of each of those banks with the auditors behind them in the assembly. It is simple.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> On the night of the bank guarantee Merrill Lynch had given about six days' advice and it had already gone bust in America. So because the headed notepaper looked good the Government of the day was diddled into bringing in Merrill Lynch which had been forcibly taken over by Bank of America. There are facts here which if spoken out in a narrative will give the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> One hundred families tonight are in deep distress that will last for a minimum of ten years and perhaps 20 years because they have legacy mortgage debt from this credit pyramid Ponzi scheme. They do not have an escape. The Tánaiste had two hours hemmed in a car, which was awful for her, but they have 20 years hemmed in their houses because of the irresponsibility of the establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> Our motion in this House was voted down by a Government Whip. That motion would have allowed us to start the inquiry - like a triage - with those balance sheets, but it was not done. Again under a Whip system, NAMA legislation on 16 September 2009 was rushed through with half an hour of preparation. The legislation was still hot from the photocopying machine in people's hands. That is wrong. The IBRC liquidation legislation was again hot with the vote stupidly at 1 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> Down on the desk of the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, there are €25 billion worth of prom bonds that should be cancelled. That would more than cover the €10 billion needed for restructuring, reconditioning and re-setting up the country's water infrastructure, including reservoirs, treatment plants and pipes, instead of trying to squeeze it out of an already mercilessly squeezed population. It is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150"> Taking €10 billion from €25 billion leaves €15 billion which would leave a lot for other capital projects which would generate income, employment and the return of skilled people to carry out those capital works. It would also underpin the social protection for the vulnerable in society who for the past four years have been beaten up and steamrolled by taking away the basic allowances and supports they have. Twenty-six people - one from each county - should go down to the Central Bank and say, "Patrick, give us those bonds. We're cancelling them and we are telling Mr. Draghi why."</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> That is the story the people of Ireland need to hear and not an inquiry that will take up huge amounts in professional costs and get lost. Who here honestly read the Honohan, Watson and Regling, and Nyberg reports? I reckon it was maybe 2,000 people in the entire country. It is meaningless stuff because the balance sheets show that the credit boom here caused it all.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1152">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the work they have done in examining the proposal over recent weeks resulting in tonight's motion. I also thank the Whips for accommodating the speaking time this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> Today is an important day. Later this evening when we agree the motion to empower the banking inquiry committee to conduct an inquiry under Part 2 of the new legislation, we will be putting in place a parliamentary inquiry that has been established to compel and bring members of the public and those involved in financial institutions and other areas before this House to give a public account of their role in the biggest financial crisis the country has ever faced. Once that parliamentary inquiry is established later this evening, it will have those powers and most importantly it will have the powers to make findings of fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> While significant preparatory work has been carried out by the committee and the secretariat over recent months, we recognise the huge volume of work ahead of us. Although we are ready for that work, it is a challenging job, as has been mentioned in many contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> At this part of the journey it is fair to say that we still do not have a full picture of the events leading up to, during and after the crisis. However, at the beginning of this journey, the responsibility rests with us, as a committee, to put the pieces of the jigsaw in place so that a full picture emerges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> This will be the first time an examination of what caused the banking crisis and the decisions made at the time will be looked at in public. A key element is that the inquiry should and will be conducted in an open and transparent manner. This will allow for a first-hand account to be given by people involved in one of the major events in the history of the State. Most importantly, it will allow the people of Ireland to see and hear those called on to give their evidence in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> With the committee going about its work, it is important that we do not just confine ourselves to learning lessons about the past, but we must also look positively to the future. This inquiry will enable us to do just that. This is necessary to ensure that the crisis is not revisited upon us again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> The people have waited a long time for this inquiry to be established. Today is just the first step on a journey of work which I believe is an opportunity to demonstrate that the Irish Parliament can hold a fair and balanced inquiry to find answers to many key questions that remain to be answered about the banking crisis. To do the job we have been given, it is necessary that we, the Members of the Oireachtas and the public, approach this inquiry with open minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and no one should pre-judge the outcome of this inquiry. This inquiry is an opportunity to demonstrate an example of a Parliament at its best. It is an opportunity for us to leave our club jerseys at the committee room door and do an important job on behalf of the Irish people. God knows, they have waited long enough for it and deserve nothing less.</p>
