#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Will the Acting Leader discuss with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the possibility of him making a statement in the House next week on the extent of damages which can be awarded to individual citizens who have been wrongly convicted? I refer to the issue which arises in respect of Mr. Frank Shortt following yesterday's High Court ruling. It is fair to say there is considerable public disquiet regarding the level of the damages awarded to Mr. Shortt following his and his family's appalling treatment by this State for a considerable period. It is also fair to say the award was paltry and I am in no way commenting on the judge in the case or on the court.I wish to refer to the legislation which underpins the possibility of awards in such cases. It is a serious matter that someone who has been wrongly convicted, treated in such an appalling way by this State and who spent nearly three years in jail on a concocted charge would, at the end of the day, be awarded such a paltry figure of €1.9 million. Will the Acting Leader raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask him if he could come before the House to set out the extent of reform he might propose following this case to ensure people in this category — this man is not alone — can ultimately obtain justice from this State? That is what these people seek. Will the Acting Leader have that discussion with the Minister and perhaps report back to the House next week?Two years ago, both Houses passed a unanimous motion allowing the Defence Forces to go to Liberia in west Africa — a much troubled part of the world. To date, over 1,300 Irish troops have served in Liberia. There are 430 troops there at present. I take this opportunity, as I am sure all Members will, to congratulate our troops on their excellent work in Liberia during the past two years. Their work and that of other peacekeepers has ensured that a peaceful election process, with an 80% turnout, could take place there this week. Too often we commit troops to locations around the world as part of our UN obligations but forget the huge commitment being made by them and their families at home and to building peace and democracy throughout the world. I salute their efforts today, given that the House debated the matter two years ago and that it was a joint resolution of both Houses which permitted them to go in the first instance. It is a job well done and we must ensure those brave men and women in our Defence Forces hear the message from this House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I want the Acting Leader to raise the possibility again of having a discussion on the food industry with a particular emphasis on the manner in which it is being treated at a European level. I may take the opportunity to raise this issue, possibly this afternoon. In recent times, I have examined the impact of regulation on the meat industry. I believe we have now reached the point where Ireland is the only country in Europe to find itself under the cosh from extraordinary decisions made at a European level to restrict the development of the food industry. In particular, more than ten years ago the House passed the Abattoirs Act which effectively made it impossible for ordinary butchers to kill livestock raised on their own land and grass. They were obliged to send the livestock elsewhere. While that caused its own difficulties, recently, the problem has become more severe. This is the point on which I seek a discussion.I have spoken to representatives from the Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland, many of whose members supply local hotels with meat, steaks, etc., which is an example of local businesses developing properly. They have now been informed that for as long as they sell to ordinary customers walking in from the street, they are in the retail sector and consequently must meet a high level of regulation. However, if the butchers start supplying their local hotel, which they have done for centuries or generations, they have entered the wholesale market where a new set of regulations exists to prevent them from developing their business and boosting the local economy. This is an example of what should be discussed.I could make similar points about vegetables and other sectors which have been affected such as fish, albeit in a different respect to the issues discussed in the House earlier in the week. I seek a discussion on how European regulation has had a negative impact on the development of the Irish food industry.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I support Senator Brian Hayes's remarks in respect of yesterday's paltry damages award to Mr. Frank Shortt and his family. Members should not forget the misery to which these people were subjected by members of the Garda Síochána, who had nothing but career advancement in mind when they intentionally harangued, hounded, abused and ultimately framed family members for offences of which they were never guilty. We must consider the damages awarded in the context of their suffering. It is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will come before the House to debate this issue because by any stretch of the imagination, the sum of €1.9 million does not in any way compensate the family for the misery and torture to which they were subjected by corrupt and evil members of the Garda Síochána during the 1980s and 1990s.On a related issue, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform came to west Cork recently to open a state-of-the-art Garda station in Bantry, a welcome infrastructural improvement for any town. However, to reach Bantry he was obliged to pass through Dunmanway, where the current Garda station is situated in private rented accommodation. It is not wheelchair-accessible, there is no cell in the privately-rented house and is not a conducive working environment for Garda members. This has been the situation in Dunmanway for the last four years.It is difficult to expect Garda members to work to their full capacity if the station in which they are supposed to work is a private rented house. It flies in the face of proper policing and it is dangerous for a town of that size to lack a decent station in which gardaí can do their job. I ask the Acting Leader to arrange, as soon as possible, a debate in respect of the entire policing issue and the proper provision of physical infrastructure for the members of the Garda Síochána.

Alec Reid has come in for much criticism for remarks he made at a public meeting yesterday evening. I heard some of the transcript of the meeting on the "Morning Ireland" radio programme.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I do not know if the House can discuss this matter.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	8	He has come in for much criticism from some quarters in the North, but his efforts in respect of the peace process must be appreciated. The depth of the reconciliation required in the North has never been more evident than when one considers the current controversy regarding that issue.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I ask the Acting Leader, Senator Minihan, to convey to the Leader, Senator O'Rourke, a request to invite the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to report to the House on the lack of support and interest in Government policy pertaining to the Irish Pensions Board. I refer in particular to the lack of interest in this respect among the self-employed. I also wish to include the lack of a pension scheme for the 850 local councillors, who are being neglected in this regard as a subject for debate. I will not be intimidated by well-paid journalists with good pensions from coming out publicly in support of pensions for councillors. Neither the Irish Independent nor the paper barons will prevent me from so doing.I believe that a scheme could be administered under the Local Government Act 1998. All council staff have a pension scheme and I do not understand why councillors who work full-time, sometimes up to 45 hours per week, should not have the opportunity to avail of a scheme to assist them in their future lives. I would support that and I ask that the Minister be invited before the House to outline the Government's policy in this regard. I believe the Cathaoirleach will support this proposal in his heart although he is constrained by his office from doing so publicly.

As the Senator has remarked, people employed by local authorities rightfully earn pensions and councillors should not be treated differently for their long service.Yesterday, I raised a question on staged payments to which the Leader inadvertently failed to respond. The point I wish to address is that the Government's legislative programme makes no mention of it. However, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, stated in this House that he believed it was an anti-consumer measure. The Acting Leader, Senator Minihan, will remember this comment as he and I discussed the matter together at the time. Members were aware of the negative consequences for consumers, particularly the adverse impact on first-time buyers. The Minister of State promised the Government's own legislation within six months. This was in May 2004. I can find nothing on the matter in the Government's legislative programme and I would like to hear the Acting Leader's comments on it.To return to the pensions issue, in general I agree with the points made by Senator Leyden apart from the question of the councillor's pensions. There is an enormous shortfall to be made up in this country and this is a serious issue that must be addressed. Perhaps the House could have a debate on the resources needed to address it.In the light of recent developments, what is now Government policy in regard to the hiring of consultants? Can the Acting Leader sum it up succinctly for the House?
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Two nights ago, this House had a debate on the Clare Street initiative by the Department of Transport. This was welcome because it at least gave Members some indication as to the Department's intentions in respect of transport and gridlock issues. This morning, I travelled to Pearse station from Castleknock on the 8.20 a.m. suburban train. I can safely state that nowhere else in the western world would such a level of service be provided. People were crushed into the train in an appalling experience which must have bordered on the dangerous. It raises questions of health and safety. Passengers disembarking at Tara Street station must descend by using the emergency exit as the station's escalator has been out of action since 6 June. They then encounter people coming in at the same time to access the station.

After 12 months, why is there no indication of when our railways will receive proper investment? When will we seriously address the issue of gridlock? The situation is appalling. I, a Member of this side of the House, am no longer prepared to stand for what is happening.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	20	We are due another debate on Northern Ireland in light of the defence of Fr. Alec Reid by Senator McCarthy. I respect Fr. Reid, as he has done honourable, good and historic work. However, it was not acceptable for him to say what he did, which I heard clearly. He said the Unionist community behaves like Nazis. This is not correct and many members of that community will be offended because their relatives died fighting fascism in Europe while the IRA collaborated as much as it could with the Nazis. One recalls the tale of Mr. Seán Russell, the IRA's chief of staff, returning to Ireland in a German submarine.It would be dangerous to travel down these roads and we must bear in mind the notion of parity of esteem. People should be very ashamed of some acts, such as the Shankill butchers. However, a good point made was that the Protestant community has never supported these butchers. They never get anywhere politically and are wiped out electorally whereas Sinn Féin, the political representative of the provisional IRA, is now the principal Nationalist party in the North. We should put these elements in context. While I honour Fr. Reid's work, his comments were regrettable. I, like everyone else, have put my foot in it several times.

The President and now Fr. Reid have made such comments; this type of inflated language should stop.Will the Acting Leader determine the exact status of the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004, which I understand has not been enacted? Would it be possible to amend the Bill to include chiropractors in its provisions, as they meet the five criteria listed? The public is unprotected as people who are not qualified despite universal qualifications existing throughout Europe can establish themselves as chiropractors and do serious damage.Will the Acting Leader arrange a debate on the people involved in the Shot at Dawn Campaign? A total of 26 young Irish soldiers who volunteered during the First World War were shot at dawn for rebellion or insubordination simply for not wearing filthy, wet hats in the trenches while they were suffering from shell shock. New Zealand has publicly exonerated its six soldiers treated in this way and awarded the medals their sacrifices deserve. Is the Government pressing this matter?

A reported incident involving the removal of nine blind people from a Ryanair flight is an important issue. We do not know all the details but it was insensitive of a pilot to ask how many blind people were on board the airplane and then ask for nine of them to be removed. They were brought humiliated into the lounge. As our legacy from the Special Olympics, we should ensure this matter is investigated to establish the facts.We held a debate on Northern Ireland recently, in which generous recognition was given to every person who played a role in bringing about a successful conclusion to the peace process. The House owes it to the process to ensure nothing will diminish the contribution made by Fr. Alec Reid.

It is particularly rich for a leading member of the DUP not to accept the apology given by Fr. Reid and say that provocation was not, in itself, satisfactory. We should recall what the DUP's leader has done through the years and the bigotry he has promoted. Fr. Reid was Christian in his comments and apologised immediately.

Coverage is 18% in County Kilkenny while other parts of the country, such as County Kerry, have 100% coverage. It would be appropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to explain this discrepancy to the House.We have not held a debate on education since returning from the summer recess. Perhaps the Minister for Education and Science could address the House concerning her announcements during the summer with regard to schools being built through public private partnerships, PPPs. I have no ideological problems with the decision but it would be fitting for the Minister to explain her reasoning. It has recently been shown that schools built through PPPs cost more money.I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments on the abattoir sector. Senators are aware of small butchers throughout the country who have suffered greatly due to over-regulation. A butcher from Graignamanagh in County Kilkenny approached me recently. Like so many other small shopkeepers, he lives and works on his premises. He must now leave as he must construct a whole array of new facilities, leaving no room for him to live and work in the building. We have witnessed the ruin of a particular sector of Irish society over the past number of years and we need to discuss how over-regulation is the cause of the end of so many of those businesses.

Two people recently entered a public house and ordered two shorts and two mixers for a certain price at 9.05 p.m. However, 40 cent was added to each short and mixer by 10.50 p.m., meaning the same order within trading hours cost an additional €1.60.

I am speaking particularly about women who worked at home and have no pension entitlements. I raised this matter previously with the then Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and am aware that the current Minister, Deputy Brennan, is examining the matter in depth. It relates to yesterday's objectionable editorial in the Irish Independent, where the Government was told that it would give councillors pensions at its peril. Who do the authors of this editorial think they are? It is obvious they have no idea about what councillors do and are completely ignorant of the workload of councillors. If people want proof of what they know, they should read yesterday’s edition of the Irish Independent.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I support the call made by Senators O'Toole and John Paul Phelan for a debate on quality food production, particularly in respect of the meat sector. We need a level playing pitch. Both Senators mentioned the food industry and butchers but we should bear primary producers, namely, farmers, in mind. Farmers are being strangled by bureaucracy and there is no point in us producing quality food at their expense. If this bureaucracy continues, there will be no farmers left in the country.I ask the Acting Leader to call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the EU to put a full ban on imports of South American beef. This beef is not produced to Irish standards and comes from countries which are riddled with foot and mouth disease and which have working conditions akin to slavery. Cattle in these countries are identified and tagged only 45 days before slaughter. It is a scandal that such beef is coming freely into Ireland. The Acting Leader should call on the Minister to come before the House so we can have a debate on the issue and protect Irish farmers.

Unfortunately, we are approximately 20 years too late in coming to deal with this matter because many small abattoirs were put out of business because of overly stringent interpretation of European regulations. These concerns were forced to compete against meat plants which were heavily subsidised under EU grants and which were supposed to export meat but which began supplying the home market after they received their grants and built their plants. We should look more favourably on the small abattoir sector and help it survive. During the period to which I refer, the Small Abattoirs Association bought approximately 5,000 cattle and 25,000 lambs each week.I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on her actions regarding Brazilian beef. We have known that there were problems with such beef for many years. Beef imports from three Brazilian provinces have been banned. In addition, the Minister's proposal to label meat products, particularly beef, lets people know exactly what they are buying and eating. I estimate that 90% of the meat in hotels and restaurants comes from Brazil or Argentina.

It is incredible to think that, in 2005, dead people are being left in the streets and emergency services still cannot reach them. It is shocking to see a so-called developed country such as the US deal so badly with the aftermath of the hurricane in New Orleans. Unfortunately, this situation has been replicated in Pakistan. Could the Acting Leader invite the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, to come before the House to indicate what emergency plan is in place for Ireland in the event of a natural disaster? One would not have confidence in the emergency services based on recent global experience. The pictures we have seen are truly shocking. I know the Acting Leader, on foot of his former profession, has personal experience in this area. It would be opportune for us to ask whether an emergency plan is in place to cope with a natural disaster here. Who would have thought that the US would have been so badly equipped for such a disaster? Hopefully, we can learn from the unfortunate situation in Pakistan at present.

We have taken a lax approach to this issue for far too long because of our stance on GATT negotiations and the effect they have on Irish trade. We have imported substandard products where the meat is not traceable and there is no knowledge about the kind of antibiotics that have been used on the animals. At the same time, we are penalising our farmers who are producing a very good product. I welcome what the Minister has done, on health and safety grounds, in respect of imports of Brazilian beef. I wish to put on the record my belief that there must be further negotiations between the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment so that we do not appear to be bending over backwards regarding the balance of trade with GATT. This issue needs to be addressed without delay.

Everyone has a go at councillors but it has gone too far this time. Public sector pensions are very attractive and agents of the public sector who virtually act as a public relations department and liaise between constituents and Government and county councils should have their work recognised.Surgeons who have treated young people and adults injured by fireworks stated in one of today's newspapers that the public awareness campaign highlighting the dangers of fireworks has failed. Could the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come before the House and outline what he intends to do on this issue because there is a degree of hypocrisy surrounding it? Fireworks are illegal in the Republic of Ireland but we see extensive breaches of the law at Halloween. The law should be either amended or examined. Last year, I spoke with two tourists in Dublin who said the city looked like a scene from a film by Quentin Tarantino. I explained to them that fireworks were illegal, which they could not believe, so we must try to amend the law.

If one adds this figure to the €2 billion that would have been invested in SSIA products, one sees that it is approximately 12% of GDP entering the economy in very short period. Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Finance to come before the House to discuss what will be done to ensure that an orderly transfer of this money takes place so that the economy does not overheat and that people get value for money in products or services? At different times, the Central Bank would have increased interest rates to ensure that inflation would not have occurred. We must now plan for the period to which I refer and I ask that the Minister come before the House with proposals on how to deal with the entry of this money into the economy.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Senator Brian Hayes and a number of other Members raised the issue of the recent court awards to Frank Shortt. We all acknowledge and recognise that awards are a matter for the courts. Senator Brian Hayes asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be requested to come before the House to debate legislation on this issue. We will ask the Minister to do so but court awards are a matter for the courts rather than this House.Senator Brian Hayes also raised the issue of the Defence Forces' presence in Liberia and we all join him in complimenting them on the service they have given in that country. Many concerns were raised about sending troops to Liberia when a debate was held on this issue in this House two years ago. The Defence Forces proved they can carry out such an operation very successfully as a result of their professionalism and preparation for their presence in Liberia. We should all be very proud of the role played by our Defence Forces on the international stage and the great credit they bring to this country. I join with Senator Hayes in complimenting them and it was right and fitting that this was raised in the House this morning.Senator O'Toole raised the issue of how the food industry is dealt with at European level and was joined in his request for a debate by Senators Dooley, John Phelan, Coonan and Scanlon. Such a debate would be welcome and I will ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, come to the House, not only to discuss the specific issue raised but also the wider area of regulation in the food industry.Senator McCarthy raised the issue of the case involving Mr. Shortt and I have already referred to that matter. He also raised the issue of Garda Síochána facilities in Dunmanway, of which I am aware. As Senator McCarthy is aware, a meeting was held between the community of Dunmanway and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon. The community does not want the Garda station to leave the centre of the town and is trying to renovate the existing premises. However, a legal difficulty exists with regard to a wayleave at the back of the station. Senator McCarthy should put the specific matter down for debate on the Adjournment and a request will be made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discuss the broader issue of Garda facilities.Senator McCarthy also raised the issue of Fr. Alec Reid's comments, as did Senators O Murchú and Norris. We are all guilty of using inappropriate and emotive language in the heat of the moment and we must allow for human nature and emotion. Senator Ó Murchú and others stated that if one is big enough to apologise for remarks made in the heat of the moment, such apologies should be accepted and the comments should be viewed as unfortunate and unnecessary. Requests for debates on ongoing issues such as Northern Ireland will be made. However, I do not know if one will be forthcoming in the short term given that one was held so recently. I will bring it to the attention of the Leader.Senator Leyden raised the issue of the lack of take-up of pensions and this has been flagged for some time. A discussion to highlight the need for people to take up pensions would be welcome and I will request that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, come to the House. Senator Coghlan raised the issue of stage payments. My recollection of events with regard to the comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, is the same as that outlined by Senator Coghlan. I cannot answer the question with regard to the Government's legislative programme as I do not know the answer but I will remind the Minister of State of the commitments made in the House and will seek to have that matter put back on the agenda.Senator Morrissey requested a discussion with the Minister for Transport on the five year strategic plan for transport. A discussion on the Clare Street initiative was held in the House on Tuesday. A request can be made that the Minister come to the House again to discuss the progress made on the five year plan.Senator Norris raised the issue of adding chiropractors to the designated groups of professionals included in the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill. I understand the Bill is on Report Stage in the Dáil and once it is passed it will be at the discretion of the Minister to add extra professions once they meet the necessary criteria. We have all been lobbied by a number of different groups that are not included in the Bill, and I have met the chiropractors group. I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children. We must examine whether the Bill will be delayed in order to add other groups or whether it will go through and other groups will be added by ministerial order. I do not know when it is listed to be completed in the Dáil.Senator Ó Murchú requested that the Minister for Transport examine the issue with regard to the removal of blind people from an aircraft. That must be brought to the attention of the Minister and I will be happy to discuss the matter with Senator Ó Murchú to ensure his message is clearly communicated to the Minister. Senator John Paul Phelan requested a debate on the national education psychological services and the use of PPPs in building schools. A debate on education in this House is due and I will request that the Leader seeks such a debate.Senator Glynn gave an example of price practice in certain public houses and catering outlets and requested a debate with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Director of Consumer Affairs has both the authority and the inspectors to investigate such issues and I hope this specific matter has been brought to her attention. The matter will be raised with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Senator Browne requested a general debate with the Minister for Defence to ensure the national disaster plan is up to date. I assure the Senator that such a plan does exist and it is run in conjunction with Government and local authorities. The request to the Minister for Defence for a debate will be made.Senator Browne also raised the issue of type 2 diabetes. Last night Senator Henry spoke on that matter, which overlaps the areas of health, education and sports. It has been highlighted in the House on a number of recent occasions in discussions with the relevant Ministers.Senator Feighan raised the issue of fireworks, which comes to the fore as we approach Hallowe'en. I presume the Senator has made his views known to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and has written to him in this regard. I am happy to highlight the Senator's observations.Senator Hanafin requested that the Minister for Finance come to the House to debate how we can plan for the influx of moneys from the SSIAs into the economy within in a short period of time. Such a debate would be welcome and useful, if for no other reason than to highlight the matter and encourage people to reflect on what will happen and how to deal with the money wisely. It would also be useful in ensuring that the economy manages the influx properly and efficiently. A request for a debate will be made and as we approach the Estimates process perhaps a debate with the Minister for Finance on a number of issues would be welcome.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I thank Senators for raising this matter and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on progress on this important issue. Even before I assumed responsibility for this area, I was struck by the complexity of the problem of domestic violence and of the need for a multifaceted approach to tackling it. Domestic violence is a serious problem, one which we may not have properly acknowledged or faced up to as a society in the past. This has changed significantly in recent years and we now have a much greater awareness of its extent and gravity. I hope this will give us the basis for dealing with it in a serious fashion.I do not propose to lecture Senators this morning on the scale of the problem or its seriousness. We now know that domestic violence can appear in many forms and is rarely an isolated or sporadic event.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	55	We also know it happens all around the country, that it affects people of all ages and social classes and is present in both urban and rural communities. I consider that it would be useful to outline what the current and planned response is to this problem. The starting point for the State's response in recent years, as many Senators will be aware, is the 1997 task force report. Arising from that, the Government established the national steering committee on violence against women, which I am very pleased to chair. This committee involves all the Departments and agencies tasked with responding to the issue as well as representatives of a wide range of voluntary groups working with victims of violence.The committee has a number of objectives, including promoting public awareness of the problem and co-ordinating responses from both the State and voluntary sector. Above all, the committee acts as a forum for co-operation and cross-fertilisation of experience and insight between the groups involved. A system of regional planning committees is in place, based in each of the old health board areas. Local State and voluntary groups are also represented on these planning committees.A great deal has been achieved by the committee and the regional groups since their establishment. Their work has focused mainly on the recommendations of the task force report. However, in more recent times we have realised there is a need to re-focus our efforts. Earlier this year we commissioned the development of a new strategic plan for the steering committee. This will take account of developments since its establishment and chart our work for the next five to ten years. It will also review the effectiveness of the mechanisms in place for delivering on our objectives. I have no doubt there is room for improvement and that we will be able to identify necessary improvements as part of this exercise. This project has involved consultation with a wide range of organisations and individuals throughout Ireland and is now coming to fruition. I expect it to be finalised early next year when we will begin its implementation.While it is essential that we have a strategic direction for our efforts in this field, it might appear that discussion of plans and strategies are a bit removed from the harsh reality of domestic violence. What we are dealing with is a crime. Society must treat it as such and punish offenders. Unfortunately, it is a difficult crime with which to deal, in large part because the relationship between perpetrator and victim is not a normal one. There are usually barriers of influence, authority, shame and even affection which militate against reporting and prosecution. Ireland is not unique in this; the international experience is identical. The key is for the State to seek to break down these barriers.I am pleased to report that the Garda has done a great deal to ensure domestic violence is dealt with as a serious criminal matter. A domestic violence and sexual assault unit was given a national role in 1997 and an assistant commissioner has been assigned specific responsibility for the area. To direct its approach, the Garda has a written policy on domestic violence intervention. That policy is arrest oriented which means the decision to arrest or not is not down simply to the stated wishes of the injured person upon arrival at the scene. The policy recognises the vulnerable circumstances in which the victim finds himself or herself. Any evidence of fear or harassment is brought to the attention of the court in the event of a bail application.The Garda role is, in a sense, to come between the power and dominance of the offender and to seek to break the hold over the victim. This domestic violence policy is an integral part of Garda training and is reinforced continually. The feedback suggests that the policy is well regarded nationally and internationally and has made for an improved response. Nonetheless, the Garda has been involved in a major review of its features, with a view to modernising and honing them further. As is proper, wide consultation has taken place on this and we expect to see the finished product very soon.In order to respond effectively, however, a legal framework for tackling domestic violence must also be in place. Again, this is an area where good progress has been made. A comprehensive range of offences is available to the Garda with which to charge perpetrators, including measures which take account of previously unacknowledged phenomena such as harassment or stalking behaviour. This is also an area where, I understand, our European colleagues believe we represent good practice. A key element in this framework is that established by the domestic violence legislation. As Senators will be aware, this provides for a range of orders to protect the victim from the threat of abuse and to punish breaches of those orders. The Garda policy is to always arrest where there are reasonable grounds for believing that such an order has been breached.Despite the progress that has been made, there is no doubt that the level of reporting remains low. We know this from a range of studies, the most recent being the authoritative National Crime Council report which found that a little under a quarter of all people surveyed who had experienced severe abuse had reported it to the Garda. The crime council report looked in detail at the reasons for non-reporting and pointed towards areas in which we must work. Lack of confidence in the system and-or the Garda feature in these responses but the overall picture is complex. More than half of those surveyed attributed non-reporting to such factors as a belief that it was not serious enough, that is was the victim's own fault in some way or that it could lead to the end of the relationship. This highlights how difficult an issue this is to tackle and how we need to do everything we can, not just to improve the response of the criminal justice system at all levels, but also to build up the confidence of victims in the system. Victims must feel they can rely on the system and that what they have experienced will be taken very seriously. We must convince them of this through our actions and in continually improving the effectiveness and the co-ordination of our responses.An important element in our response is also to improve society's awareness of the problem, to emphasise that domestic violence is a crime and that help is available. Some of the best work of the national steering committee has been in this area and I believe it has borne fruit. The steering committee has run national print, poster and broadcast campaigns and the response received has been positive. We have also funded local groups to run awareness raising programmes in their areas. A key element in much of our campaigning work has been to let people know they can play a part in ending domestic violence. We hope these campaigns will encourage members of society to help make a safer and better life for those affected by violence.Another less high profile but invaluable task has been to make available information leaflets and other publicity material. These are widely distributed. People experiencing violence must be able to easily access information in a simple format about where they can turn for help and what are their rights. We have also provided funding on a pilot basis to programmes which involve awareness raising among older secondary school students and are interested in working with the Department of Education and Science to ensure this is expanded.There is obviously much more to be done to encourage further and earlier reporting and to improve the criminal justice sector response. I expect this will form a central part in our new strategic plan and we will not be afraid to look critically at every element of what we do. As I stated, however, we will need a multifaceted approach to this problem and thus we are incorporating a range of more novel solutions into our overall approach. Consequently, the Department funds a number of perpetrator programmes designed to promote changes in personal behaviour and prevent future abuse. This is challenging work and far from being straightforward but, in some instances and with the right safeguards, it does have a role to play in tackling the problem.In recognition of the difficulties experienced by persons appearing in court under the aforementioned circumstances, the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime within my Department also provides funding to Women's Aid and Rape Crisis to assist with running court accompaniment services. We also fund a pilot domestic violence intervention exercise in the Dún Laoghaire and Bray areas which aims to work with all of the agencies in the locality, including the Garda, the courts and the probation and welfare service so as to make the criminal justice system and other response systems work together better. I look forward to reviewing the lessons we can learn from this exercise.Our record demonstrates that we will examine any model or listen to any advice that may contribute to tackling the problem. If it seems to have the capacity to add to the solution, we will test it and seek to integrate it with other efforts. We also work closely with non-governmental organisations, academics and others in commissioning and funding research into all aspects of domestic violence. We realise that the problem is complex and that the solutions need to be evidence-based. As already stated, the problems experienced in Ireland are similar to those in other jurisdictions and we are involved in regular co-operation with other authorities. In particular, we co-sponsor a very productive forum, Raising the Standards, which involves a wide range of official and voluntary bodies in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales.I am conscious that my comments so far have focused on the criminal justice response. In emphasising that we need to treat domestic violence as a crime, we should not lose sight of the fact that victims will need services that are outside the capacity of the criminal justice system. If these are effective, it may encourage people to report crimes but, even if they never do, it is essential that their health and welfare needs are met as a priority.The Department of Health and Children is responsible, through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to victims of violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. As the Senators will know, these are mainly provided by non-governmental organisations. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government assists in the provision of crisis accommodation, including refuge accommodation for people who are forced to leave their homes as a result of domestic violence.All of our work with the relevant non-governmental agencies takes place on a partnership basis and I am very conscious of the need to ensure they are adequately funded to provide their vital services. As many Senators will be aware, the scarcity of resources in this area has been a matter of concern for some time. Funding from the Department of Health and Children, for example, has been increased to €12 million from the base of less than €4 million that obtained when the national steering committee was established but there appears to be a need to consider increasing this further. I am sure this issue has been raised with many Senators — as it has been with me — by various groups throughout the country.The funding question was, as many Senators will be aware, highlighted last week by Women's Aid when it presented its annual helpline statistics. I do not want to engage in a micro-discussion on the funding needs of any particular group but I appreciate that Senators will have an interest in this instance. It certainly calls attention to the issue generally. I am pleased to say that the Health Service Executive will be meeting Women's Aid shortly and that the funding issues can be raised directly with it, as the responsible agency. My Department already provides funding to Women's Aid under a number of headings and is also in discussions with the organisation regarding certain of its needs that fall within our funding remit. I hope this will enable it to direct resources towards frontline services such as its helpline.On the more general funding question, arising from concerns regarding this issue I established an interdepartmental group earlier this year to examine funding for the whole sector. The group is examining the needs that exist, the funding already available and the co-ordination of funding across Departments. The aim is to ensure that the sector is in a position to provide proper treatment and support services to all who need them and that the national budget for these services can be planned in a co-ordinated way. The group will shortly be making its report and I hope to be discussing the recommendations very soon and planning their implementation with my colleagues in Government, including in the context of the Estimates campaign.I pay tribute to the many non-governmental organisations that have, over the years, provided services and support to victims of domestic violence, many of whom I have had an opportunity to meet. As I said, we are open to suggestions on how to take this work forward and I look forward to hearing Members' views on the subject.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House to discuss this very important issue. It is very often neglected and we do so to our cost. If we choose to neglect the many women — it is mostly women — who suffer from domestic violence, we are doing them a great disservice.The Minister of State will be aware that the Women's Aid helpline received almost 20,000 calls this year. This is an increase of 5% on the number of calls last year. There was also an increase in the number of calls the organisation missed because it did not have enough personnel to take them. I would welcome any commitment to make available to the organisation the funding necessary to provide an adequate helpline service.It sends shivers up our spines to think of what it must be like to be in a setting where there is domestic violence. It is usually not just the women who are in such a setting because, in general, children are also present. Surveys show that women admit that children were present during the majority of violent incidents in their homes. This is certainly not good for any child.There is evidence to prove that a person who has been abused himself or herself as a child, or who has witnessed abuse, may grow up to be an abuser or be abused. It is an issue that affects the entire family and others and, therefore, must be tackled. We have been talking about this subject for many years and I feel we are not making enough progress. The problem will get worse because of our changing society. We now have many foreign nationals living in our country who come from different cultures. It is possible that in the countries from which they come, and certainly some of the eastern European countries, women are not as well respected as they are here. I know dreadful violence is perpetrated against many women in such countries. The people are now living here, some of them living in circumstances where there is domestic violence. When the Minister of State is drawing up a report, he will need to consider the cultural differences and practices of people of other nationalities who are now living in Ireland and make them aware of how we value women and the fact that we will not tolerate domestic violence.Another issue that arises because of our changing society is the trafficking of women. This practice highlights the plight of another group of people who are being abused. I would like to see this issue addressed in any report the Minister of State produces. Only last week we saw reports in the media on the opening or proposed opening of a lap dancing club by a well-known personality from the United Kingdom. The sex industry culture is coming into the country and this needs to be addressed. The question as to whether this is to be allowed might warrant a Seanad debate for another day. However, strict guidelines should be in place to assure the safety of women participating or working in those premises. These are vulnerable groups coming into Ireland and they need to be dealt with, quite apart from Irish people already living in situations of domestic violence.People living in these situations put up with matters for some time. They may ring the Women's Aid helpline or seek help in other places. When all else fails and the situation cannot be improved, the last resort is to leave home. That is why we need to have a very good support mechanism in place, namely, refuges throughout the country. It is well known that these excellent facilities cannot cope with the demand. It is sad to reflect that if women have to leave home, in many cases bringing their children with them, they cannot find a place either in a local refuge or one that could be many miles away from home. There is the question, too, of children being taken from their schools and environment, thereby compounding the problems. The lives of the children involved are being upset. It is therefore very important to have refuge accommodation in every county.I was very disappointed to learn recently that the refuge that was planned for the Dublin 15 area in Blanchardstown is not to go ahead. That is a great mistake, given the area has a population of nearly 100,000. If a refuge is located locally, it means at least that if children are brought along, they can continue to attend their own schools so that their daily routines are not upset too much. More direct action needs to be taken. The Minister of State is dealing with this matter through the voluntary organisations but he cannot wash his hands of it like that. If the voluntary organisations are to do this work, which is the way in which the Government is dealing with the problem, they must be given the necessary funding. It is no use paying lip service to the problem by saying the money has been given to the organisations concerned and they should simply get on with it. The organisations say they do not have enough money and need to be adequately resourced. Otherwise it is a matter of paying lip service and that is not good enough. We also need to ensure that the services being provided are appropriate to all women, whether native Irish or immigrants.As regards the legal system, fewer than one in ten women victims of sexual violence reports the matter to the Garda. We are really looking at just the tip of the iceberg. Very few women will have the courage to go to the Garda. They see reports in the newspapers about rape cases. The number of rape cases brought to court do not reflect the overall number of such incidents every year. Consider what a woman must go through when she goes to the court, say, in a domestic violence case with all that this entails, whether she has been beaten up, emotionally damaged or, indeed, raped. Very few women are strong enough after such experiences to put themselves through the courts. The courts system needs to be looked at to see if it can be made more user friendly. Women in such situations feel an enormous amount of hostility towards them. It is a matter about which people do not want to talk. Men certainly feel uncomfortable talking about this and the issue tends to get brushed under the carpet. We can no longer do that and must address these issues. Tackling the courts area would do a great favour for many women so that this problem can be properly addressed.I hope the Minister of State will continue to fund the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women. This committee certainly does a great deal of good work and needs to be funded. I look forward to the report it is to publish shortly. However, it has taken a long time to get this report and the committee is to present a five-year plan. What have we been doing for all those years? Women have been living in this type of situation for a very long time. Let us get on with it without delay and make it work.I will finish with a statistic to show how serious is the issue. In 2004 Women's Aid reported that 107 women were murdered since 1996, 69 of them in their own homes. This is the extreme when we talk about murder, but it is happening on an increasing basis. A year later those numbers are higher. Obviously this situation is unacceptable. Women are in danger today and want to see action.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate the Leader on putting this issue down for discussion. It is almost two years since it was last discussed in the House. It is a matter of such major importance that it should, indeed, be debated much more often. We should be monitoring the progress being made, if any.I compliment the many voluntary organisations that work at the coalface, in this regard. Women's Aid, in particular, springs to mind as one of the great strengths for unfortunate women who suffer from domestic violence. The level of comfort and commitment that organisation gives to these people is unquantifiable. Unfortunately, Women's Aid is working in a vacuum, attempting to cope with fire brigade situations on a basic needs level rather than in any type of co-ordinated manner. That is regrettable because it means the organisation's efforts do not measure up appropriately, through no fault of its own.Those of us who have never experienced domestic violence can only begin to imagine how lonely a place it must be for a woman and her children, where these are involved. It is through the tireless efforts of the voluntary bodies concerned that we are now discussing the issue of which there is a much greater awareness. Through their efforts we now realise this is a serious, complex and social issue. We spoke of this matter nearly two years ago when I recall quoting a statistic that out of 81 women murdered, 53 had been killed in their homes. I was reading some of the information that came to us which indicated that these figures related to 1996 and we were talking about it early in 2004. The figure has now gone up to 111, they tell us, with 72 women murdered in their homes. In the intervening period 30 women have been murdered, 19 of them in their homes. That is a damning statistic.The research also indicates that one in five women suffers this type of mental, physical and sexual abuse. Imagine how difficult it can be for a woman to leave an environment such as that. Research indicates that those who take this step are in greater danger than they were while in a violent relationship, which is hard to believe.It is imperative that we take all necessary steps to ensure women experiencing domestic violence are adequately supported when they take the onerous decision to leave a relationship. We must remember that a woman who makes such a decision leaves behind all her aspirations and desires for herself, her partner or husband and any children she may have. Many victims leave their homes accompanied by their children and with only the clothes on their backs. It must be a devastating physical and emotional experience for a woman to risk leaving a violent relationship knowing full well the mind of her abusive partner. She will experience the trauma of leaving home, the apprehension that her partner will carry out reprisals and the emotional distress of worrying about her future and those of any children she may have. I cannot even begin to imagine what must go through a woman's mind in such circumstances. Mothers will put their lives on the line for their children and many will stay in violent relationships and endure the pain in the belief that it is the lesser of two evils because leaving would result in their children having no roof over their heads.It is a sad reflection on society that so many women live in fear. As Senator Terry noted, domestic violence is primarily a women's issue and most perpetrators are men. The fact that it occurs in the home, supposedly a loving and protective environment, makes the experience even more devastating for victims. It is dangerous to regard the fact that perpetrator and victim live together as a mitigating circumstance or a grounds for preferring a lesser criminal charge. The opposite is the case as there is nothing more distressing that having one's partner turn on one in a violent manner. One cannot repeat loudly or often enough that domestic violence, rape and sexual result are heinous crimes, which are committed against people of all ages, colours and creeds and impact both on individuals and their wider family. Such violence can also take place in a loving environment.One need only imagine the confusion felt by an innocent child faced with domestic violence. Research indicates that children are in close proximity when 80% of recorded cases of domestic violence occur. As a result of this exposure, they have difficulty adjusting to particular circumstances, become withdrawn, secretive, silent and bitter and, in certain circumstances, engage in self-blame. I can imagine the confusion they must feel about their parents' relationship. They tend to suffer sleep and eating problems, experience sadness and depression, have trouble with learning and school and, in certain cases, inflict self-harm. This is a terrible start on life's journey for a child. God knows life is tough enough without having to deal with domestic violence.It is clear from these facts that action needs to be taken quickly and resources provided to deal with the problem. I am pleased to note the Minister of State's comment that he is open-minded in this regard. Senators should meet those working on the front line of domestic violence as often as possible because they can give us a great insight into the action required to address this dreadful problem.There is probably no one present in the Chamber who does not know someone who has experienced domestic violence. Unfortunately, the terrible silence surrounding the issue means we probably do not know half of what takes place. The fact that women will be assaulted an average of 35 times before reporting it tells us a great deal. Thankfully, stronger laws have been introduced which I hope will alleviate the problem. There is an onus on the Oireachtas to do whatever possible to improve the horrible position in which women affected by domestic violence find themselves. We need to create an environment in which it is easier for those affected to come forward in the full knowledge that they will receive the protection of the community. We need to establish education and awareness programmes to highlight the many forms this terrible crime can take.Sometimes I believe the name given to the crime is inadequate. Domestic violence should be seen for what it is, namely, a cowardly act, carried out by a cowardly individual who preys on someone he knows to be weaker than himself and carries out acts he would not do to a person who could fight back. The Oireachtas has a primary responsibility to make a major effort to bring about change in this area. We owe this to the women and men — one in 16 males will suffer domestic violence — who experience domestic violence and the voluntary groups working in this area. These organisations have my support and I encourage the Minister to allocate more resources to tackling the horrible cancer of domestic violence.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I am moved by the sensitive approach taken by Senator Kett in his excellent contribution. I always find non-confrontational debates of this kind very useful because they provide the Seanad with an opportunity to play a positive role and it is good the House discusses these matters. I was reminded the other evening that it was only 25 or 30 years ago that women Senators, for instance, the then Senators Mary Robinson and Gemma Hussey, tried to raise issues such as violence against women, contraception, the law on criminal conversation, which allowed a cuckolded husband to sue his wife's sexual partner for the value of her sexual services which had been distrained from him. These and other issues, including rape within marriage, were first raised in the House by a series of courageous, forward-looking women who were roundly trounced from all sides for having the temerity so to do.At roughly the same time, organisations such as Women's Aid became involved in the issue. I salute the presence of a number of distinguished representatives of these organisations in the Visitors Gallery. I recall doing a James Joyce one-man show to raise money for the women's refuge in Rathmines around ten or 15 years ago. This was one of the first concrete examples of a building being constructed to house women who had been victims of violence.I was interested to read in one of the briefing documents I received about the immense impact of Roddy Doyle's television series, "The Family", shown on RTE in 1994. This general artistic theatrical presentation resulted in an immediate and enormous increase in the numbers of calls received by organisations working in this area. I salute Roddy Doyle, an author sometimes dismissed rather too easily, not only for the programme but also for an immensely moving book, The Woman who Walked into Doors. The interesting title tells it all. That was immensely moving because it looked at the syndrome, mentioned by Senator Kett, of women who wait until the 35th attack and justify it, make excuses and pretend it did not happen or their injuries were the result of an accident.We last looked at this issue in January 2004 and it is important that we continue to monitor it. I am glad to see that there have been a number of advances since we last debated it and I compliment the Department on this. Civil legal aid has been given increased resources. Waiting times have been reduced to four months. This is not ideal. A situation where one feels one's welfare is in danger is a critical and urgent one. Even though it may be an improvement, a waiting time of four months is simply too long. There is no doubt that in the case of domestic violence, in particular, justice delayed is justice denied.The in camera rule has been amended and women now can be accompanied to court by a third party in support of them. One aspect I appreciate very much about the work of Women’s Aid, in particular, is that it engages in one-to-one interaction. In these circumstances that sort of humane approach is important.However, the situation is not entirely rosy, as the Minister of State knows because he has responded to it during the week and also in a glancing reference today. There is further support needed from central resources because of the frequency with which the telephone service, for example, is used. The freefone helpline is open every day, except Christmas Day, from 10 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night. In 2004, 19,901 calls were made to the service, an increase of 5% on the previous year. Women's Aid responded to 12,147 calls. That leaves some 7,700 missed calls because Women's Aid did not have sufficient resources of personnel, offices, machines, etc. Those 7,700 missed calls are the ones which should worry all of us because there should not be any missed calls.If people are in situations where they are being subjected to violence, they are desperate if their calls are missed. It is our responsibility to support those agencies to make sure they are not missed. There were 30% more missed calls last year. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who has done good work in this area indicated, according to newspapers, that he also was concerned about this and that he understood from Women's Aid that a sum of €70,000 might resolve the situation. That is a tiny amount of money. If that would mean that next year 7,000 calls were taken rather than missed and 7,000 people in misery were given some support, that would be the best spent €70,000 imaginable. I hope this comes about, although I noted that the Minister of State in his speech spoke of the need to increase the amount. We must salute and acknowledge the fact that, historically, it has been increased. This is an issue which should be looked at.There is also the question of the origin and nature of the calls. It is worrying that so many of the cases of violence are generated domestically. We can tell this from the figures. Another aspect of Women's Aid I like is that it does not collect statistics because it is interested in the human dimension. When the telephone call is made Women's Aid wants to support that other human being and the gathering of statistics is only incidental. It would be inappropriate in a cold-hearted way to ask a caller's age, marital status, etc. People want support and they get it. Women's Aid is quite good at getting statistics of various kinds, however, not just the number of calls received but a profile of the perpetrators of the abuse, which needs to be addressed.It is shameful that over half of the abuse disclosed was perpetrated by the current partner of the woman. Marriage remains the most common context for domestic violence among the calls to the service, with 38% of women disclosing it was their husband. That is a chilling statistic. While there are many decent husbands and many good families, it means we must look with a critical eye at the reality within so many families. A further 13% of these acts were perpetrated by either a male partner or a male co-habitee. We all know of situations — often we see them on television and read about them — where not just a husband or a partner, but occasionally a male who has had the relationship terminated will not allow a woman say, "I am sorry, we made a mistake. I am bringing this relationship to an end.". She may then be met with murder because she is not considered to be allowed this freedom. That is very worrying.We also need to look at broadening the range of services because so many of the calls come from Dublin and it is a Dublin centred organisation. We should ensure that this service is spread throughout the country as far as possible. I take it the Minister of State has received Women's Aid briefing documents containing all the points on the budget and changes in legislation which it requires to be made.It is regrettable that groups like Amnesty International, which have taken this matter on board seriously, and Women's Aid should be attacked regularly by certain columnists in principal national newspapers.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The attacks are unbalanced and unworthy. One must put them in the context where they challenge whether this is a gender-based issue. The United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women states:...violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the most crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men...That is a world view and is not adequately challenged by people who are against it.Aspects such as the rights of co-habitees must be looked at. If I had more time, I would draw the parallels with violence against the gay community. Having said all that, we must not close our eyes to the fact that there are circumstances in which men are subject to violence and while the violence is predominately against women, we should ensure that no citizen is badly treated.There is an automatic assumption that if a woman engages in violence against a man, it is his fault and he is responsible. There was a notorious case in the courts in Dublin recently where an unfortunate man was stabbed 21 times, hit 26 times with a hammer and flattened to death. There was a record of violence by his wife against him which was not presented to the jury and she got off with manslaughter. We need to accept that there are a minority of cases where, within marriage or relationships, men can be subject to violence and we are not doing any justice to the cause by ignoring that. No doubt it is essentially a gender based issue and our arguments will not be reduced or diminished by accepting what may be, in a small minority of cases, the reality.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	61	There are times topics come before us when it is difficult to know where to start. This topic is so disturbing that I reflect on it and wonder how to make a valuable contribution on the task facing us. I spoke here on the issue in January of last year and referred to the physical and psychological marks and scars which domestic violence leaves and which one person can inflict on another. I described it then as an evil form of violence and that is how I feel about it.I want to examine both the dark and the light, the awfulness of domestic violence and the courage and brilliance of the people working in this area. Reports on the extent of the problem in Ireland, as in many other countries, make depressing but essential reading. Almost 20% of Irish women experience domestic violence at some time in their lives. This is one in five wives or partners, mothers, sisters, daughters and friends.It is quite difficult to get one's head around what this statistic means for the many women who experience this evil and the effect it has on them. Research shows that domestic violence is typically ongoing and therefore may be known as a type 2 traumatic event. Studies suggest this can have a significant impact on the woman or child's functioning and can affect their emotions, concentration and reactions or cause them to withdraw from society. It can also cause nightmares, flashbacks etc. When we see the significant level of this kind of behaviour among adults and children, we realise there are many hidden stories. We may be unaware of what is going on in the background.Domestic violence problems led to approximately 8,500 Garda responses in 2003, some 23 per day. More worrying studies suggest that only one in three women who experiences severe abuse reports it to gardaí. I do not want to confine domestic violence to women. I acknowledge that men and the elderly are also subject to it. We seem to forget that the elderly may be abused. In our changing society where many adult children remain in the home, there has been a significant increase in the number of barring orders being taken by parents against their adult children. We must acknowledge this as part of the domestic violence area.The problem is complex and difficult to deal with, both for society and Government. The issue spans many political areas and six Departments. The Government is committed to annual funding for awareness programmes to tackle domestic violence and to ensure that housing and shelter programmes fully address the needs of those who have experienced such violence. This is a testing commitment. I recognise and appreciate that the specialist budget for violence against women programmes in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for example, increased by 40% in 2005 to €1.124 million. In the run-up to the next budget, we need to examine carefully how departmental budgets collectively shape up against the needs in this area. Will the total approach the €19 million specialists say is necessary?The second element of the Government commitment to ensure that housing and shelter programmes fully address the need is a challenge we must meet. We must address the fact that Women's Aid was unable to answer two out of five calls to its national helpline in 2004 and that 7,754 calls were left unanswered. When I hear that just under half of the 2,800 women who sought emergency refuge accommodation in 2003 could not be accommodated, I am distressed. The Government is committed to ensuring that housing and shelter programmes fully address the needs in the lifetime of its programme. We know there is some way to go when over half of these accommodation refusals are because the refuge is full.I said I wanted to examine both the dark and the light, and there is some light. We have shining examples of dedication, courage and stamina from groups such as Women's Aid, which provides information and support on a voluntary basis to women experiencing physical, emotional and sexual abuse. It has been dealing with this issue for over 30 years and has my immense gratitude and respect.I will be parochial and refer to the Cork counselling service which has worked for 20 years in my community supporting families experiencing the terrible trauma of domestic violence. I commend that service. Statistics from January to June of 2005 show that 48% of all clients who initially presented themselves for help stated "relationship problems" as their reason for seeking counselling. However, the Cork service recognises that behind these statistics rest enormous numbers of stories of domestic violence, ranging from physical to psychological or sexual abuse. Based on its 20 years of work in the community, it states that until relatively recent times acknowledgement of domestic violence across various classes was a problem. We must be mindful that domestic violence is a problem across classes affecting both genders. I note that the National Crime Council study, which examined the victimisation of both women and men, found that one in 16 men had experienced domestic violence.Groups such as the Cork counselling service play an important role in helping families in distress. When we consider the consequences of domestic violence, the task of counselling is critical. We need to examine the issue of funding when we see funded statutory bodies taking calls and offering people an appointment 12 months down the road and then referring them to agencies such as the Cork counselling service. Funding must be given to the people who can provide the necessary immediate service and attention.It is right that we highlight and recognise the needs in this regard in the House at this pre-budget time. We must ensure when the frustrating annual debate on economics and the distribution of resources takes place that those working at the coalface on issues such as domestic violence have their case heard. Statements in this House may be part of that process. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I assure them that we will do all we can to ensure their voices are heard so that we make more progress on this pressing issue.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I thank the Leader and the Senators who pursued this issue for ensuring this important debate took place. Domestic violence is a serious issue. We do not know what goes on behind people's doors from the time they close them at night to coming out the following day. The situation has been and remains merciless and traumatic for the hundreds and thousands of women, in particular, who have been subjected to violence by partners, husbands or male relatives, down through the years. I can only begin to imagine what it is like for people to be in such a life-threatening situation.I want to focus on services in rural areas. Senator Minihan pointed out the many fine services in Cork city, in particular, the Cork counselling service. However, in rural areas where people are victims and are subjected to horrendous abuse they do not always have the ready option of leaving. The question of where they can go arises, particularly when they have young children because people do not want to see somebody landing on a doorstep with three or four young children because they have been forced to leave their home as a result of violence. There are some good centres that offer a haven. However, there is a risk that the perpetrators of violence may go looking for the girlfriend or partner and threaten the safety of that haven. Some people do not wish to go to shelters. We need to examine the broad range of services and how they can be extended. There are no limits to domestic violence in terms of towns, cities or villages. The problem is everywhere and this must be reflected in terms of Government action. We must recognise that these services have a role in rural areas. Like Senator Norris, I welcome some recent developments, including the increase in civil legal aid, the amendment of the in camera rule and the development by the national steering committee of a strategic plan to tackle violence against women. While I hope such welcome and practical measures will improve the services offered to people who encounter domestic violence, I am concerned that they will not go far enough to combat the problem.I compliment Women's Aid on its publication of an informative, detailed and well researched briefing document on domestic violence. While I do not wish to bore the House with many statistics, I would like to highlight some of the issues raised in the document. The national domestic violence helpline, which is open for 12 hours a day seven days a week, received almost 20,000 calls in 2004. It is a phenomenal level of use of any service. One of the most regrettable statistics — it is tinged with sadness — in the Women's Aid document is that two in every five calls to the helpline are not answered due to a lack of resources. That is not good enough in this day and age. During Private Members' time last evening, the House discussed the level of funding given to sport. Many Senators mentioned that the economy can afford to allocate the money that is needed to implement real measures in such areas. It is important to emphasise again, in the context of this debate, that the State is in such good fiscal health that it can facilitate the allocation of resources to all sectors.I would like to highlight a chilling quote from the report of the Government task force on violence against women: "Whether it be sexual assault, rape, physical assault or emotional abuse, women are at greater risk from husbands, boyfriends, male relatives and acquaintances than from strangers." That is quite disturbing and extremely worrying. When we think of violence, we think of being mugged or having one's wallet taken in a dark alley. I did not think, until I encountered the statistical evidence I have mentioned, that the cowardly thugs who perpetrate the evil abuse of other human beings are most likely to be husbands, boyfriends and partners. Such people are not fit for society.Local authorities have a real role to play in combating domestic violence. I recently encountered the case of a married woman who had to leave her home when her children came of age and started to tackle their father. The squabbling between her husband and her children was particularly bad at weekends when alcohol had been consumed. Her home life became unbearable as her children started to retaliate against their father. The woman in question, who required private rented accommodation because she was leaving a local authority house, had to borrow a significant amount of money from a relative to pay her deposit and rent. The local authority has informed the woman that it cannot consider her housing need and that of her family because she and her husband are officially listed as joint tenants of the family home. The local authority's explanation that it is not in a position to meet the housing needs of a woman who was being kicked, punched and beaten every weekend, until she finally plucked up the courage and acquired the means to leave, defies logic.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Yes.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The authority claims that it cannot help the woman in question because she is a joint tenant of a local authority house, along with a thug who has perpetrated evil acts against her. I have tried to convince the local authority to examine the case with the humanity it demands and to give the woman a house on the basis of her needs. She is currently in rented accommodation, which offers her a safe haven from the abuse she has endured, but she has a long-term housing need. Issues of child custody also need to be considered in this instance. There is a persistent threat of violence when her husband calls to her house to collect their children. The man in question is liable to do anything when he leaves the pub at the weekends. Local authority tenancy agreements are clear on the steps which will be taken in cases of anti-social behaviour, but I suggest that similar provisions be put in place in instances of domestic violence. People who perpetrate such violence should be evicted from local authority housing as a matter of course. Not only would such measures ensure that difficulties such as those I have mentioned do not arise in cases of joint tenancies, but they would also help to resolve some domestic problems by removing abusive thugs from family homes. We need to end the bureaucratic nonsense that means that local authorities cannot look after the housing needs of women who take the brave decision to leave their homes, having acquired the means to do so.It is important that we attempt to increase awareness of domestic violence and modify society's attitude to violence in general. If one watched the "Prime Time" programme that showed two drunk people holding each other up and another person getting stuck into them, one will not doubt that society is accustomed to a certain level of violence on television screens. Incidents on football pitches and outside nightclubs feed into the psyche to which I refer. There is a need for a dramatic change in society's attitude to violence. For example, we need a "get tough" policy in respect of those who perpetrate horrific acts against other human beings. I appreciate that a broad range of measures is required, but we could start by putting in place educational programmes, for example at national school level, to increase awareness of the problem of violence. We need to ensure that everything that can be done to change attitudes is done. We should not underestimate the role of alcohol abuse in cases of domestic violence. The Leader has allowed Senators to debate the issue of under age drinking and the broader issue of alcohol abuse on many occasions. It is obvious that there is a inextricable link between alcohol abuse and domestic violence. I assume that most cases of domestic violence involve alcohol abuse.I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is in possession of a copy of the well researched and thorough Women's Aid briefing document, which contains summaries of its extremely well thought out recommendations. We should not consider the issue of domestic violence in financial terms, but in terms of its urgency. Acts of domestic violence will be perpetrated tonight and tomorrow. While I appreciate that there are funding constraints, I appeal to the Minister of State to deal with the issue of domestic violence as a matter of urgency. He should examine the salient and fine points made in the Women's Aid document. I wish the Minister of State well in that regard. While it may not be appropriate to wish Women's Aid success, I wish it well in the future. It provides a marvellous service to frightened people who have been bullied, harassed and assaulted. Any organisation that offers support services to such people deserves the good wishes of the House.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	65	When I met Mr. John Connolly just over a month ago, at the request of Women's Aid, he sought my support as a politician in highlighting the issue of domestic violence. I said I would do my utmost to raise the matter in the Seanad and at meetings of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. Last week, the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, and I attended the launch by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, of the 2004 statistics relating to the national Women's Aid helpline. I was impressed not only by the Minister of State's speech, but also by the empathy he showed with those who have been victims of domestic violence, a diabolical crime against women that is being suppressed within our society. As Senator Kett said, the Members of this House will continue to raise the profile of the campaign against domestic violence. It is about time that attempts were made to tackle such violence, which is a secret, dark and murky crime that takes place in the shadows and about which people find it embarrassing to speak. The Leader of the House swiftly arranged these statements on foot of the launch by the Minister of State last week. I have invited eight representatives of Women's Aid to attend this debate as part of my response to Mr. Connolly, who asked me to help in any way I can.The National Crime Council and the Economic and Social Research Institute have published an interesting study of the domestic abuse of women and men in Irish society. Dr. Dorothy Watson of the ESRI and Ms Sarah Parsons of the NCC did some superb work as part of that process. The reality is that an estimated 80% of women and men who suffer domestic abuse do not tell gardaí of this because they do not believe the issue is serious enough or because of shame and embarrassment.The ESRI report to which I referred stated that 15% of women and 6% of men in Ireland have experienced severe abuse. It is worth spelling out what constitutes severe abuse. The report notes that domestic abuse is a pattern of physical, emotional or sexual behaviour between partners in an intimate relationship that causes or risks significant negative consequences for the person affected. It involves physical abuse and threats, including slapping, shoving, pushing, punching, kicking, threatening to hurt and choking. The report states that sexual abuse involves attempted, actual or forced sexual relationship or intercourse, forced viewing of pornography or other forced behaviour. Emotional abuse involves deliberately embarrassing someone, name-calling, preventing contact with family, threatening to take children and preventing the partner from having money.The impact of severe abuse often involves injury to the severely abused. Half of those who have been severely abused have been physically injured. Women who are abused are more likely than men to have injuries needing medical treatment. The impact of emotional abuse, which affects more women than men, involves fear, distress and loss of confidence. Members will understand how they would have difficulty standing up in the House to give an opinion if they had to suffer such emotional abuse. I was asked last week to give some advice to a young girl. She told me that her partner calls her stupid when they have a row. I asked why she could not get out of that relationship and move on. How could any of us fully participate in society if we had to suffer the brutality of being told we are stupid?The ESRI report suggests that 59% of those abused are under 25 years of age. An interesting point is that in two thirds of cases the abuse happens early in the relationship, in the first two years. The abuse is triggered by various factors. In 38% of cases, the report suggests it was triggered by nothing in particular or minor incidents, while alcohol was a factor in 34% of cases. Those most at risk are women, young people, single people and those with weak ties to extended family or community.It is irrelevant what region victims live in, what level of education they have, or their income or social class — abuse takes place across every strata of society. It is a deep, dark secret that is not getting exposure. However, I am confident my parliamentary colleagues and I will support the Minister of State when he makes his case in this regard at our parliamentary party meeting in November.At present, family cases only come up in the middle of all other court cases. I call for the establishment of regional family courts which would hear cases in private. More people will come forward if cases are held in private and if family courts are established throughout the country. We need to give more support to organisations like Women's Aid, which last year could not respond to two out of five of the telephone calls it received. The organisation received 20,000 calls last year from people who need immediate help.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I thank Senator White for providing such important statistics to the House. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on the amount of work he has done in giving additional support to Women's Aid and for bringing the issue of domestic violence into increased public view. He and I met recently at the launch of the Rape Crisis Centre report. The Rape Crisis Centre is now 25 years old and it is depressing that so many rapes still take place in a domestic situation, where the assailant is known to the victim and is perhaps a family friend or family member. These are the cases which are least likely to be pursued through the courts because victims feel they will not be believed if they tell what happened within their homes. I am glad Senator Minihan referred to the issue of elder violence. As soon as helplines are installed, it is found that they are used by a considerable number of the older age group.Reference was made to the courts. It is unfortunate that barring order cases take so long to come to court. Frequently, the woman — if it is a woman — can be intimidated or placated into withdrawing her complaint, which is a pity because the abuse can often be repeated. The Judiciary has had some education in the area of domestic violence but more would probably be useful. Senators will remember a case from some decades ago when, with regard to a very violent situation, the judge advised the husband and wife to go out to dinner, have a couple of steaks and a bottle of wine, and all would be well. The judge was living in a very different milieu to the one in which the unfortunate couple lived.I accept that drink has some influence on violence. However, the Joint Committee on Health and Children heard an interesting presentation some weeks ago by women from the west who are involved in the Rape Crisis Centre there and in helping women in violent situations in rural areas. I was taken by the contribution of one of the women. She said that while a man may get drunk in the pub, he does not start to beat up the barman. He might then get a taxi home but he does not beat up the taxi driver. However, when he gets home, he somehow feels he can beat up the person at home. While drink is important in making people lose control of themselves, they manage to control themselves with a barman or a taxi driver and it is only when they get home that the beating begins. While the role of drink is an important factor, we must not let it become an excuse for everything. It is fine for people to apologise the next day and say they were drunk, but it is worth remembering that woman's point.I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, with regard to this issue — I am glad the Leader is in the House to hear this. Yesterday he launched the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, report on World Population Day. In particular, he referred to that part of the report which deals with gender-based violence, which happens not only in developed countries but in developing countries as well. We must encourage governments in these countries to set up programmes.The explanatory memorandum of the UNFPA report states that gender based violence kills and harms as many women and girls between the ages of 15 and 44 as cancer, that the toll on women's health surpasses that of traffic accidents and malaria combined and that the cost to countries in increased health care expenditure, legal fees, policing and losses in educational achievement and productivity are commensurately high. It further states that national campaigns against gender based violence are one of the quick win solutions recommended by the UN millennium project and that in some countries, efforts are already under way because gender based violence is so widely tolerated, successful action ultimately requires social transformation, effective law enforcement and a strengthened judiciary aimed at ending impunity and that gender sensitive education and the mobilisation of communities and opinion leaders are needed to prevent violence. Needless to say, men must be engaged to take a strong stand on this issue.I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has raised this. I note he is to engage the former Senator and President, MaryRobinson, who has a long history of promoting human rights and has great knowledge of gender issues, to help in his campaign. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for all the work he has done in this area.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I am glad to contribute to this debate and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. When Senator White and others put it to me that we should seek such a debate, we contacted the Minister of State's office and he freely and quickly agreed to attend. One might ask what such a debate will achieve. I believe it is important because what we say highlights the issue and gives us a chance to review what has happened and to mark a way forward. Like Senator White, I also attended the Women's Aid conference and was greatly struck by the practicality of its members, to whom I was able to speak informally, and by the way the facts were presented. Those facts were clearly researched and were put in a non-argumentative way. We were given the information we needed.Women's Aid is a long-established and highly respected organisation dealing with family abuse and domestic violence. That it is long-established means we respect it and appreciate the facts it gives us are correct. Senator Henry has a long involvement with Cherish, one of the earlier women's organisations for single women who found themselves pregnant, and with many other women's organisations. I am glad the views of men and women have been expressed in this debate.When I started doing county council work many years ago, this issue was beginning to come out into the open. People were beginning to talk about it as a real issue. I remember many late night calls to my house from women who were emotionally as well as physically bruised and who had travelled there by taxi. We would talk over the matter. At that time, there was still an unspoken assumption that somehow a man had a right to abuse because, after all, he was master and lord within his domain. Thankfully, we have moved miles away from that point of view.People often had large families. If a man wanted to assert his married rights, or whatever he called them, the woman, who knew nothing about condoms which were perhaps not available or who had no contraceptive advice available to her, would not want to succumb and become pregnant because there might be seven or eight children in the home. I remember a woman telling me that she had gone to see a priest who told her it was her job to succumb to her husband. It sounds so antiquated now. When we take the marriage vows, we say "to love, honour and obey", although I know some great feminists will not say "to obey".The idea that one would have to succumb to violence so that one would keep one's place in the home seems so antiquated now but elements of that remain in that this must be the most unreported crime. The Minister of State correctly said that it is a crime and that the Garda assault unit dealing with it is highly regarded, not only in this country but internationally. At the same time, how many crimes go unreported but are hidden with the victims saying that tomorrow might be a better day and that perhaps all of this might go away? How many women face each day without knowing whether it will be their lot again that evening?Some 20,000 calls in this regard is a huge number. These calls are made by women who are driven to do so because of the dire situation in which they find themselves. We are in this lovely Chamber having an informed debate and it is difficult to place oneself in such women's or, indeed, men's minds and identify with the anguish they experience. It is difficult to describe, in a few sentences, the fact that love, sex and abuse may form the palette of emotions in one small unremarkable home. I still find vestiges of the idea that women somehow feel they are to blame for the violence wreaked upon them. How could people place themselves in a position where they would have to bear the brunt of such violence? To take up Senator White's point, some women continue to think that they are inferior human beings and that they, perhaps, are at fault for the violence perpetrated against them.The interdepartmental group established by the Minister of State is to report shortly before the Estimates. I would be glad to speak at our parliamentary party meeting on this issue and to ensure adequate funding is provided to what is a very worthwhile cause.I pay tribute to Women's Aid. I do not do so only because its esteemed members are in the Visitors Galley. I would do so if they were not present. It does unsung, unpraised and unheralded work. Murky and distasteful as it is, that work must be done. Many young women operate its telephones on a voluntary basis. I hope all the calls will be answered because the Minister of State gave approval in that regard at the launch of the report. Those anguished telephone calls must not go unanswered. Those who make the calls and who are in dire distress must hear a voice which will give comfort and succour. I am glad to contribute to the debate, from which, I am sure, some good will come.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I concur with what previous speakers have said. Domestic violence against women is only a political issue in respect of funding and intervention and we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on this sensitive and delicate matter. Some €20 million per annum is provided for services for female victims. That is a great deal of money and it acknowledges the fact domestic violence against women is a major problem. We need ongoing intervention and communication between the Departments concerned. This is an issue that will not go away and we should focus closely on it.Most of the arguments and discussions today have been in respect of domestic violence against females. I wish to refer to a letter which was recently sent to the editor of The Irish Times by Ms Mary T. Cleary of the AMEN group. I understand that a report was launched this summer by the National Crime Council in association with the Economic and Social Research Institute which contained some startling figures with regard to domestic violence against males. I am glad this letter appeared in The Irish Times because the statistics are startling and frightening and it is important they be put on the record. A total of 15% of women and 6% of men suffer severe domestic abuse. A total of 29% of women and 26% of men suffer from domestic abuse when the categories of severe and minor abuse are combined. The next figure baffled me. A total of 13% of women and 13% of men suffer physical abuse. There is parity of esteem between the genders in this respect.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	69	If it can be so described.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Exactly. A total of 29% of women, or one in three and only 5% of men, or one in 20, report these incidents to the Garda. While I do not wish to take from the arguments regarding domestic violence against females, there is an issue if only one in 20 males report domestic violence to the Garda. The three figures I have highlighted must be considered and evaluated. We must ask whether we are addressing the needs of the male gender. Is the issue of domestic violence being addressed from the perspective of a single gender or is it being examined holistically from the perspective of both genders? This is something we should examine closely. Before my colleague Senator John Paul Phelan makes his contribution, I want to ask one question of the Minister of State. On 21 September, the AMEN group met the Minister of State and asked whether he was in a position to provide funding to the group for male domestic violence. While I am open to correction, my understanding is that at the time, the Minister of State did not reject the request outright. However, it was made clear that it was highly unlikely that the group would receive any ongoing Government funding to provide support for male victims of domestic abuse. Is this true? If this is not the case, what is the Minister of State's position with regard to providing funding to male victims of domestic violence?
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thank Senator McHugh for sharing his time and I thank the Leader of the House for arranging the debate. Most points have already been covered. Senator McHugh is correct in noting that there are not great differences between Members as far as this issue is concerned. I wish to reiterate an issue raised by Senator McCarthy, namely, the role of local authorities with regard to housing difficulties in which people in domestically violent situations find themselves. I encountered a situation fairly recently in Kilkenny whereby a woman who was being abused by her partner in another jurisdiction was asked by the local authority to travel back to England to try to secure her share of the family home, before being considered for placement on the housing list and before becoming eligible to receive rent allowance for her accommodation. Clearly, if she felt it necessary to travel across the Irish Sea to get away from her partner, it was entirely unsatisfactory for the local authority to act in this manner. This is an anomaly which the Minister of State and the relevant Department, which is probably the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, must examine. Housing or accommodation for people who find themselves in such situations is essential but thus far, it does not appear to have been tackled to any degree.I agree with other Members with regard to the problems with funding. While there has been a small improvement this year, over the last four or five years there was no improvement whatsoever in funding for the different organisations supporting domestic violence victims.The Government might need to consider initiating preventative measures for people who find themselves in domestically violent situations. I refer to situations whereby the gardaí might be called to a house two or three times but the abused women may not wish to press charges against her partner or to proceed any further than the call-out on the night. However, a case could be made that in such situations, a mechanism should be triggered whereby the offender would be obliged to go on an anger management or similar course. This could be done instead of pursuing the individual who suffered from the domestic abuse to go to court and all that rigmarole. Quite often the victims have children by the offenders, have a strong relationship with them and do not want to take the legal route. Perhaps there is an opportunity for a mechanism to be put in place whereby some sort of intervention could be made by the gardaí that does not require victims to go to court. That would be a source of relief for many who find themselves in domestically abusive situations.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I thank all the Members who contributed to this debate which has been useful to me and to my officials. In particular, I thank the Leader of the House for initiating the debate. As she remarked, it is worthwhile to have this kind of debate, not least from my perspective whereby I can learn from the Members' contributions, but also in terms of continuing to maintain a high profile on this issue.There are three important aspects to the strategy being pursued at present. All are under consideration in the strategy that is now being developed under the auspices of the national committee which I chair. One is that the perpetrators of domestic violence are brought before the courts and that justice is done as quickly and effectively as possible. Clearly, that is not happening to the degree it should at present. It takes far too long and the required burden of proof is such that only a small minority of cases actually get to the courts where the perpetrators are brought to justice. This issue is being addressed at several levels and I am particularly anxious to make progress on it quickly.Second, the resources required to support the work being done by the NGOs are insufficient. I have addressed this problem since taking this job. In the past 14 or 15 months, I have only brought one deputation to meet the Minister for Finance. It was a group from this sector, including the Rape Crisis Centre network, Women's Aid and other organisations. I did so because the Department of Health and Children had not increased the allocation of resources to this area during the previous three years. I hope this issue will now be addressed in the context of the Estimates, because I accept there are not sufficient resources to do the job being demanded of those organisations. They should be provided with funds if for no other reason, because such organisations carry out significant and preventative work. Given that the cost of curing many problems from a health, psychological and sociological perspective is so much higher, it makes sense to invest more money in preventative measures than is the case at present.The third aspect pertains to the critical issue of awareness. Again, I hope to try to improve the level of support for the good work being done on awareness across the spectrum.We want awareness among the general community. As a number of speakers, including the Leader, have said, this crime was traditionally accepted in this country as the male in the household was thought to be dominant. We are moving away from a cultural tradition that was unacceptable then and is certainly unacceptable now. We must empower women to come forward and report any forms of domestic violence. I have attended a number of seminars over the past 12 months and I listened to women who were the subjects of domestic violence say the burden lifted from their shoulders when they realised there was someone they could talk to. This was the first major positive impact for them. We must get the message across that these women should come forward, services are available and people, such as those present in the Visitors Gallery, are prepared to listen.As a society, we must accept this is a heinous crime that is just as bad as, if not worse than, most other crimes. We cannot tolerate it and will not do so, a message our society must accept. At a recent launch, Women's Aid stated €70,000 would ensure calls that are unanswered by their services now would be answered. It was in this context that I responded immediately, saying we would try to find the money. We are doing so. It is a matter for the Department of Health and Children and the HSE but my officials and I are in discussion with both. We are also in discussion with Women's Aid to try to put together the resources it requires over the next 12 months.I thank the Senators for their contributions. On AMEN, I have met a number of men's groups over the past 12 months and acknowledge the existence of an equality issue. The State does not currently respond in any way. I have indicated this to my officials and, last week, to the national committee. The Department must examine the issue. Various men's groups feel very bitter that they do not receive equality of treatment in courts or elsewhere. It is a matter we must examine, which we are prepared to do.I responded negatively to AMEN as the vast majority of money sought for was for office accommodation and other types of costs I am unprepared to fund. Much money is being spent on offices and staff throughout the HSE and we will certainly not fund anyone else in the same way. I am prepared in principle to help people who wish to put services in place but I will not do any more. My advice to AMEN was instead of seeking offices, equipment and salaries from the Government, it should seek money to provide advice and assistance, which I am prepared to discuss. I thank everyone for participating in the debate and hope we can make progress on this important issue.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on European issues. The European Union is currently going through a period of uncertainty. The rejection of the draft EU constitution in the French and Dutch referenda marked a setback for the process of European integration. This was compounded by the failure in June of the European Council to agree on the future financial perspectives of the EU.Neither is Europe doing well on the economic front. The core European economies are battling high unemployment, rising public sector deficits and social systems faced with funding the needs of ageing populations. In addition, across the EU there are difficult national debates about how best to integrate immigrants into society and about the geographical limits of Europe. Externally, the EU faces an ever increasing competitive challenge from the rising, low cost and highly productive economies of Asia, particularly China and India, and from the huge agricultural producers of Brazil, Argentina, Australia and the US. Against this background, it is easy to become pessimistic. Many commentators suggest that the EU's original vision has become obsolete and needs to be radically updated.I reject this pessimism and this bleak view of Europe's prospects. Europe is a stunning success on a political level and is hugely underestimated on an economic level. Fashionable Europessimism is dangerous. It only serves the interests of those who want to weaken the EU. Such weakening carries the risk of returning Europe to an earlier age of competing, loosely linked nation states. That Europe was one where the mightiest pursued exclusively national agendas at the expense of the small and the weak in the short term and the entire Continent in the longer term.Last year, the Union took in ten new member states which are being fully integrated into the EU family. They have accepted the values that underpin the EU and their relatively new democracies are anchored in the EU. They will prosper economically and will benefit from European solidarity through the Structural and Cohesion Funds. We have not fully appreciated what a monumental achievement this represents. The fall of the Iron Curtain ushered in massive change on the Continent, change that could have resulted in political instability and conflict. One need only consider the former Yugoslavia to see how easily territorial conflict and ethnic hatred can raise their heads in the absence of strong institutions and policies which support co-operation, solidarity and partnership.Instead of economic disruption, political instability and social upheaval, the fall of the Iron Curtain has brought the spread of peace, democracy and human rights across the Continent. The EU has been the instrument of this transformation, just as it underpinned the new democracies in Spain, Portugal and Greece in earlier enlargements. The people of the western Balkans know and recognise the immense value of the EU and are now looking to us to help secure their future peace and development after the ravages of the Balkan wars. Turkey is looking to the EU as its home in a globalising world.Europe faces daunting challenges on the economic front and there is much work to be done in facing up to the challenges of globalisation. On the other hand, Germany is the world's largest exporter with a corporate sector that is reaping the benefits of restructuring. The dynamic Nordic economies and Spain are growing strongly, while France is home to one of the most productive workforces in the world and to many of the EU's most successful global companies. The economies of our central and eastern European partners are set to grow strongly. The eurozone has generally strong external economic balances and enjoys a trade surplus with the rest of the world. The recently published UN human development index featured 12 EU member states in the top 20 in the world, with Ireland at number eight. These countries have the best quality of life in the world. Let us not, therefore, delude ourselves into thinking that the EU is in terminal economic decline.The rejection of the draft EU constitution in the national referenda in France and the Netherlands was a major shock. Their Governments, without our experience of holding national referenda on EU issues, were taken aback to find that many voters did not see the EU as relevant to the concerns they faced in their daily lives. The fact that the EU has lost the confidence of many people across the Union is not a complete surprise to me. The result of the first referendum in Ireland on the Treaty of Nice was an early manifestation of a sense of disconnection with the European project which is now general throughout the EU and which was never specific to Ireland.In June, the European Council initiated a process of reflection and debate on Europe in all member states. The European Commission will launch its own contribution to shaping the debate on Europe in Brussels today. The Government wants our national debate on Europe to be open, inclusive and informative. The Government and the Oireachtas will play leading roles in this debate and the National Forum on Europe will also play a key role.Today, we are publishing the Government's White Paper on the European Constitution, which is an important contribution to our national debate on Europe. It explains in clear and accessible language what the EU constitution is about and why it is important for Ireland and Europe. The White Paper also stands, on its merits, as an important statement of the Government's policy on the EU, on how the enlarged EU can best work effectively in the interest of all and, most important, on the common values that all EU member states share. In publishing the White Paper, we are also affirming the Government's view that the EU constitution is a good document that we would like to see implemented. I accept the outcome of the votes in France and the Netherlands. However, I firmly believe that if we are to equip a Union of 25 or more member states to deal with the challenges facing it, we will inevitably return to the EU constitution. While the ratification process may be suspended and the future uncertain, I cannot see the EU constitution going away indefinitely.The national debates on Europe should be used as fora for frank discussions on dealing with the challenges now facing the EU. I do not believe that Europe needs root and branch reform. I agree, however, that the EU needs to better use its institutions, common policies, Internal Market, development aid and external trade to face up to the challenge of globalisation.Globalisation is a fact of life and has, on the whole, been a positive force for global development. We see the daily advances made by China and witness the progressive transformation of India into a major trading nation. These two countries, which between them constitute two fifths of the world's population, are using trade and investment as the way out of poverty. They, along with many developing countries, often quote Ireland as one of their models for economic development.Globalisation is having a dramatic effect on the plight of the poorest people. In China for example, the number of people living on less than $1 a day fell from 490 million in 1981 to 88 million in 2002. At the end of this month, I will attend an informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government in Great Britain. This meeting will allow all the EU's leaders to discuss the management of reform in Europe and how Europe can reconcile its strong commitment to social solidarity with the competitive pressures and challenges of globalisation. This is a timely meeting that will help restore momentum and confidence to Europe. It is important that the meeting is not sidetracked into a fruitless debate about the relative merits of different social systems. Instead, it will hopefully focus on how we can best co-operate through the EU in facing up to globalisation.We need a clear and well thought out strategy for dealing with globalisation in the EU. This strategy must include social partnership and must have a strong focus on research and development. It must harness the benefits of our internal market, include a more effective use of our common policies and a more coherent approach to our political and economic relations with China and other new trading nations. It must also include a strong commitment to a successful and balanced outcome to the WTO Doha round negotiations. In the coming months, as the member states debate and reflect on Europe, the EU must provide strong and convincing evidence that when we in the EU act together, we make a real difference to people's lives.I fully support the British Presidency's objective of securing agreement on the EU's future financial perspectives at the European Council in December. Agreement on this important issue would be a real boost for the European Union. For Ireland's part, we will continue to insist that the agreement reached by the European Council in October 2002 on the future funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is fully respected. We will also work to ensure that the European Union has the resources it needs to meet the demands we place on it. We will strongly support the provision of generous structural and cohesion funding to the new member states.Over the past weeks I have set out a clear and cogent argument in defence of the CAP. Simplistic and negative statements about the CAP, many of which are driven by self-interest, are continually being made. These statements are becoming lodged in the public consciousness. In my statements, I have stressed the following key points — the CAP is the only fully funded common EU policy; it plays a vital role in securing Europe's food supplies; average farm size in the EU is much smaller than in our main international competitors and the CAP has given Europe relative price stability when viewed against the huge price oscillations in international commodity markets.Over the past 15 years, the CAP has been subjected to three major broad-based reforms, in 1992, 1999 and 2003. The 2003 reform was based on a unanimous agreement reached by the European Council on future CAP funding up to 2013. The 2003 CAP reform was also the most radical since the CAP was established because it decoupled subsidies from production. Farmers will now produce in response to market signals alone and not simply to receive a subsidy. Expenditure on the CAP is falling significantly. The ceiling agreed in October 2002 for the EU of 25 member states for 2013 is less in real terms than the ceiling agreed for the EU of 15 member states for 2006. In addition, charges that the CAP damages the ability of developing countries to trade are not correct. The EU is by far the largest importer of agricultural products from developing countries, and absorbs approximately 85% of Africa's agricultural exports and 45% of those from Latin America.I welcome the opening of the enlargement negotiations with Turkey and with Croatia on 3 October. I also want to see Bulgaria and Romania take up their places as full member states. Last December, the European Council agreed that enlargement negotiations should be opened with Turkey and Croatia in 2005. It was important that the EU lived up to the commitments it had given, particularly because the two candidate States involved had made extremely strong national efforts to comply with the conditions set down by the EU.Widespread public unease and concern clearly exist across Europe with regard to the further enlargement of the EU, particularly the possible accession of Turkey, a country of 70 million people where economic development is considerably behind even the poorest EU member states. In the coming years, as the accession negotiations progress, much work must to be done to convince people that Turkey can meet the requirements for EU membership, that the EU has the capacity to absorb Turkey and that full membership is very much in the long-term interests of both the EU and Turkey.I do not doubt that the accession negotiations with Turkey will be tough and difficult for both sides. While the negotiations are not preordained to succeed, and accession should only be on the basis of full compliance with the requirements of membership, we must make every effort to ensure they do succeed. The enlargement of the EU essentially involves enlarging the community of countries that subscribe to the European Union's values. These values are explicitly set out in the constitution for Europe, namely respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Obviously a demonstrated commitment to these values will be central to the future success of any accession negotiations.Other issues on the EU's agenda which need to be pursued in the coming months are the fights against terrorism, organised crime and drugs. In areas such as these, the added value of collective action by the member states is self-evident. Finally, the EU must implement a legislative programme that is relevant and aimed at strengthening it to face up to the challenges of globalisation. I welcome the EU Commission's recent decision to review and withdraw more than a third of the proposed laws pending at the European Parliament and Council. This does not mean the EU is abandoning regulation. It means that Europe is now focused on better regulation which is an approach we have been advocating for the past two years.In the coming months, the Government and the National Forum for Europe will promote the national debate on Europe. As part of this process, we will schedule a full debate on Europe in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I look forward to receiving the contribution of the Seanad to this national debate. The Government coincided the publication of its White Paper with this debate, and that White Paper is part of the process. I welcome the continuing engagement of the Seanad on the European issue during the months ahead, particularly as we approach the Austrian Presidency next June, when decisions on whether to move on the constitution will be taken. I thank the House.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I welcome the Taoiseach to the House. He concluded his remarks with reference to the publication of the White Paper which we received within the past couple hours. I welcome it and it will be of assistance in the necessary ongoing broad debate we will have on European issues during the coming months.I thank the Taoiseach not only for his attendance but for the work he and his Government have done on European issues during the past number of years, particularly with regard to the proposed constitution for Europe. However, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, the question of Europe and our role in shaping its future is back on the agenda and we are once again at a crossroads.Questions with regard to the enlargement process, expanding the territory of the European Union, the financial perspectives, the Lisbon Agenda and many others remain unanswered. Into the vacuum caused by doubt on these issues has come a worrying and dangerous level of indifference and apathy in this country. A central challenge facing the Taoiseach and the Government is to re-engage the people on European policy and direction in order to help lead and shape the broader European debate on matters relating to the future of the continent.In recent years, those across the political spectrum in this House have taken part in numerous debates on the constitution for Europe. It is disappointing that research shows almost half of the public do not have an opinion on that constitution. Since the defeats suffered in referenda on the constitution, particularly in France, the period of reflection and consultation that was due to take place here has become more a period of silence and inaction. I welcome the fact that the ratification period has been extended beyond the original deadline of November 2006. It is absolutely vital that the additional time allowed will lead to active engagement by the Government with the public on the issues of Europe's future and our role in that process.The fact that nine out of every ten people tell survey companies that they believe we have benefited from EU membership is welcome. However, it is disappointing they have so little interest in the constitution for Europe. We must politically challenge the public with regard to the importance of the European project, its role in the social and economic development of this country over the past 30 years, and the importance of Europe progressing and expanding politically and not standing still. We must reiterate the point that in today's world, one can move backwards or forwards politically but one cannot stand still. We must attempt to drive on.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Hear, hear.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	76	This morning at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs attended by some of my colleagues, we had a discussion with the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Georgia. It was certainly good to hear from a Foreign Minister of a former Soviet bloc country who now sees the future of her country as part of the broader European family.That brings me to the question of Turkey, to which the Taoiseach referred. I welcome that significant progress has been made with regard to Turkey and the idea that Turkey may eventually become part of the European Union. However, I appreciate the many miles which must be travelled prior to this happening. Significant reform has begun in Turkey from an economic, human rights and social point of view.One of the greatest attributes of enlarging and developing Europe is that those countries which seek to become part of the European family must agree to take on board the democratic, open values of equality and justice that are very much part of the European agenda. We hope to see that developing in Turkey, which I believe will eventually join the European Union. Turkey will bring a young and vibrant population that will be in marked contrast to the current demographic profile faced by the European Continent. We have an aging population and a reducing workforce. That is an enormous challenge facing the present European Union of 25 members. This matter requires urgent attention. We have not faced up to the fact that our economy will have to import hundreds of thousands of immigrant workers. We have not taken on board the political and social debate on this issue. The same is true of the rest of Europe.We are not making enough progress on the Lisbon Agenda. Perhaps other speakers will also refer to this matter. The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, impacts to a great extent on this country, especially rural Ireland, which has traditionally been a big supporter of the European project. Sadly, it is now clear that the only political aim of the present British EU Presidency appears to be an attack on the CAP. We must strongly resist the British efforts to dismantle the CAP both here and in Brussels. I welcome the Taoiseach's recent speech on that issue.The domestic considerations of Mr. Blair, Chancellor Brown and the broader British political establishment should not result in the dismantlement of the CAP. It has stood the test of time and achieved what it was set up to do in the Treaty of Rome. It has guaranteed the production and supply of top quality food for the benefit of the consumers of Europe, not just the agricultural community. We must defend this vital component of the economy. I encourage the Taoiseach to keep up his efforts to ensure that the CAP will stay in place until 2013 and that the British efforts to dismantle it will be resisted in full.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for coming here to talk about the European Union and its constitution. I congratulate him on the fact that it was under his leadership during the Irish Presidency of the EU that the constitutional treaty was brought to its conclusion. Unfortunately, since then it has been rejected in referenda in France and the Netherlands. This was a major shock. The message appears to be that people have lost trust and confidence in Europe and the constitutional treaty had no relevance to their daily lives. This setback has led to a difficult period in which we must take time for reflection in all member states. As the Taoiseach stated, the constitutional treaty can be revisited again during the Austrian Presidency. We must ask why this has happened. Some soul searching will be required in the debate during the next six months on the future role of Europe, its vision and what is the purpose of the European constitution.Last year ten new members acceded to the European Union. Many of these countries came from deprived backgrounds with political instability and social upheaval. The Iron Curtain has fallen and many of these countries have only recently experienced democracy. The constitutional treaty sets out the Union's values following enlargement. Its purpose is to try to make the workings of the institutions more effective with less regulation required to bring about institutional reform. Initially the European Union had six members, now it has 25 member states. It is understandable that the workings of institutions had become cumbersome and bureaucratic and it was necessary to try to make the workings of the Union more effective, manageable and accessible to people. The Union is different today to how it was 50 years ago.There is a perception that decisions are made without consultation, that everything is decided in Brussels and that we are losing our Irishness. It is necessary to get across the message that this is not the case. Europe is about co-operation and cohesion. National Parliaments will have the big say under the new principle of subsidiarity. Every initiative proposed in Brussels will now have to be vetted by the national parliaments. That is an important and key area. From here on, when Brussels proposes an initiative an impact assessment will be carried out on its effect on our people. We must get that message out. This will mean that the Commission and the Council of Europe will have to be accountable and connect more with the public. Less regulation will be in place.As a member state, we have had the experience of the failure of the first referendum to ratify the Nice treaty. We quickly found out that it was lost because of the fear of being absorbed by the bigger states and that their was no sense of accountability or relevance. We have learned that lesson, so it should not be too difficult for us to continue that debate and to open it up. I welcome the Taoiseach's launch of the White Paper. As he said, there is no going back. We have benefitted from membership of the European Union, which has transformed our country. We must not forget Ireland is committed to the European constitution. We have benefitted to a great extent from the Structural Funds and from the cohesion policy. We made full use of those opportunities so it is necessary that we ensure that other member states will get the same opportunities we got in the past.We must have economic co-operation among member states. We have free movement of goods and people and our industries are regulated but we must create that confidence among other member states. That is the challenge for the future. The National Forum on Europe, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, will lead that debate forward. The challenges that face us include globalisation and enlargement of the European Union. Turkey has entered into negotiations on accession, and Romania and Bulgaria are due to enter the EU in two years' time.I congratulate the Taoiseach on his firmness regarding reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. There can be no cherry-picking. We are all in this together and we must confront matters. Having said that, while globalisation is a fact, economic co-operation is important, as is the fight against terrorism. We must continue to take a collective approach but at the same time we must not forget social justice. The debate that will take place will centre on how we can best protect our citizens and how national Parliaments will make decisions rather than having them imposed by Brussels. If we get that across, we will not have any difficulty achieving the right result in the referendum.I again congratulate the Taoiseach. When the debate begins we will have a duty to make sure we connect with the public. We must start here in this Chamber. By using it as well as the other Chamber and the National Forum on Europe we will make a success of it when the time comes.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Taoiseach is most welcome. I am an enthusiastic European and I defend Europe wherever I go. Last week I was in southern Africa where I met disadvantaged people. They do not understand how we can support agriculture in the manner in which we do in Europe yet claim to be interested in the Third World.The old quote I often cite, is: "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for life." As long as we continue to support the Common Agricultural Policy in Europe in the manner in which the Taoiseach has defended — I understand that national interests are defending it — then we are not truly supporting the developed world. Can the Taoiseach state how we are to address the fact that we in the developed world are open to the accusation that we are not doing our bit for developing countries? Giving them cash and help is not sufficient as we must find some way to stop subsidising uneconomic growth, as we are doing in Europe.On my way back from southern Africa on Tuesday morning, I stopped at Heathrow Airport. As I sat in the business lounge I picked up The Economist and saw therein an Austrian advertisement stating how Austria could compete with a country in north-western Europe with which it is competing for jobs and business. I could see at least five or six Europeans reading it. The advertisement was a reminder of Ireland’s great success and of how much the country is admired, principally due to our economic success in recent years. We must not end this success by failing to pass the relevant legislation. The onus is on us in this regard. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure a regulatory impact analysis of all legislation is carried out, particularly that concerning the enforcement of European directives. An example arose yesterday in that we had a very good and useful debate on the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill.On the Lisbon Agenda, as has been mentioned, we really must sell and market the benefits of the European Union to the people of Europe. We have not done this nearly well enough. The great benefits need to be sold if we are to succeed in making sure the citizens of Europe understand what is involved. I urge us to continue to sell the benefits just as Senator Maurice Hayes is doing at the National Forum on Europe.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I welcome the Taoiseach and the fact that I have just received in my pigeon hole the White Paper on the European Constitution, which will be very valuable and useful. It has arrived at a time when the European Union has formed a new plan D, which it calls "Dialogue, Democracy and Debate".I am not sure I share entirely the Taoiseach's optimism regarding all the newly acceded states sharing the fundamental values of Europe. In this regard, consider in particular the countries that were in the former Soviet system. Poland has experienced a dramatic lurch to the right and some of the leaders of the countries in question have taken extremely regrettable positions on human and civil rights. In light of the great increase, by ten countries, in the size of the Union, I am not sure we can say with confidence that all of them share our views on fundamental human rights.I know my distinguished colleague, Senator Ormonde, said the directives from the European Union will be sent here for ratification by Parliament. The Taoiseach and I both know, because we are cynical old birds, that this is just a rubber stamp. So much material is generated by Europe that it is impossible for us to monitor it accurately. When the regulations concerning copyright were being produced, I spotted the problems that would arise regarding the Joyce estate and asked to be told when the regulations were due to be introduced. However, they went through on the nod and nobody raised a peep; therefore we should be careful about assuming we have a certain kind of regulatory influence.I am also worried about the biometric passports issue because of the undemocratic way in which it was rushed through. The procedures were rather odd. The European Council pressed the European Parliament to accept the relevant report despite the fact that it had been changed. The question of facial identification was in the initial report and that of fingerprints was not. At least fingerprinting was considered an option. In the second report, fingerprinting was mandatory. Normally when there is this much change in such material, there is a requirement to pass it again, but this was not done. The Council blackmailed the European Parliament by saying it would not pass instruments regarding immigration and asylum issues, in which it the European Parliament was interested, if it did not play ball. We should consider the legal analysis by people such as Professor Steve Peers, who questions the legal basis. I will not elaborate on it at this point. I am worried about the use of biometric identification for monitoring innocent, decent citizens and the impact of Eurodac on the asylum-seeking population.I support Senator Quinn's remarks. It is very interesting that a major business person, with a very extensive interest in supermarkets and food, should take such a decent and idealistic position on the question of the Common Agricultural Policy and its effect on third countries. I noticed that the article the Taoiseach wrote in the Financial Times was picked up on because of some of the statistics contained therein, which I am sure the Taoiseach did not generate. These statistics could be challenged on the basis of the supports for agricultural producers both in the United States and Europe. They should be examined in both these regions. We must get the facts absolutely accurate or our position will be exposed. I thank the Taoiseach very much for coming to the House.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I appreciate the few minutes I have been allowed to speak on this topic and I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.Like many of the other speakers, I will refer to Turkey's proposed membership of the European Union, the constitution, the role of parliaments and the issue of subsidiarity. After a campaign of some 40 years, Turkey has officially entered membership talks with the European Union. This has been a fraught process, even up to the last few hours before the agreement, but we must all welcome the fact that an agreement was reached. Provided Turkey meets the specified criteria, its membership of the European Union is to be supported.The issues of human rights, reform of the military and judiciary, and the circumstances in Kurdish areas receive the most attention when Turkey's membership is discussed, but Turkey's goal is to meet the entire set of criteria for membership and accept the acquis communautaire. It has a long way to go, but for those of us concerned with the specific issues, including human rights, reform and the Kurds, its goal must also be ours.The whole process, including the need to satisfy present EU member states, has unhelpfully been characterised by some as tantamount to running a Christian club. We need to counter this argument firmly and be absolutely clear that the European Union, rather than being a Christian club, is a family of democratic countries committed to working together for peace and prosperity. Europe is a continent with many different traditions and languages, but also with shared values such as democracy, freedom and social justice. The European Union defends these values and is right to do so.These values are not exclusively Christian values — they may sit with them — but values that all peoples, genders, faiths, creeds and races must accept. The values of democracy, freedom and social justice threaten no one except those who oppress and harm, and suiting or appeasing such people should not be what we are about, regardless of accusations of the European Union being a Christian club.On the issue of the EU constitution, I echo the words of the President of the Commission in his congratulations to the Taoiseach, his officials and the Irish Presidency generally for achieving an agreement that proved difficult, and for achieving something that is transparent and runs deep. Compare the constitutional position in Ireland and that in other parts of Europe. Since 1937, Bunreacht na hÉireann has provided Irish citizens with a single, clear and living document that sets out their rights, their system of governance and the limits on the State. It is accessible and has been relied upon by the courts, and nobody can say it has not delivered in the past 68 years. Unfortunately, the same cannot yet be said of the European Union. We must remain committed to rectifying this.The decision of the French and Dutch peoples to reject the treaty was a setback, but one that has provided us with an opportunity. Some benefits may actually accrue from the refocusing of minds on the basics of what we, as a people, actually want from the European Union. Those benefits must accrue. The issues of what we want as a people, the size of the Union and how democratic it should be are closely related to my points on Turkish membership, as are the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands.We have time to do some useful thinking. The November 2006 target for the entry into force of the constitution is unlikely to be met and there is no pressing need for Ireland to hold a referendum immediately. We can wait to see how progress is made across the European Union and we can address the concerns of its citizens and work to strengthen its democratic operation. The media have a constructive role to play in this regard.National Parliaments can and should play a central role. Citizens expect their national parliaments to scrutinise the Union on their behalf. I will conclude with one concise point. Much is made of the so-called democratic deficit in Europe, of nations losing control, etc. These claims emanate primarily from parties of the left, namely, Sinn Féin and the rest. The point is that the proposed constitution confirms the status quo. If the EU is allowed to legislate in an area of policy, its law will overtake any national laws. Equally, in areas where it does not legislate. national law prevails.The proposed constitution will stop the Union from encroaching on the rights of member states other than in areas where they have given them away. We should not allow simplistic and ill-founded arguments to confuse and frustrate progress on the values of democracy, freedom and social justice, which are at the heart of the European project.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for taking the time to come before the House to spend a couple of hours with us.Others have made the point that we need to sell the European Union more. I guess we must do so but I suspect I am more sanguine on this than others who have spoken. I do not believe we can reasonably expect to fill town halls throughout the country, out of context, as it were, with people mad to learn something new about the European Union. The citizenry will never be filling the streets with flags and balloons, saying how great the European Union is. In Ireland, the European Union's greatest success is the fact that people take it for granted and that it is part of our democratic architecture. Nobody in this country, in politics or civil society generally, seriously suggests that we could or should leave the European Union. That is a fantastic measure of success in terms of the Union.This is not to say that we should not have a debate and neither should we take it for granted. However, we have it within us to get a "Yes" vote on the European constitution. Naturally, if we put referendums to the people every two or three years there will be a "No" result every now and then. I have said before that if the people of Kerry are repeatedly asked whether they want to remain part of the Republic of Ireland, sooner or later there will be a "No" vote. If it is a bad day and people are feeling grumpy or have lost an all-Ireland, there will be a "No" vote. I do not want to dismiss it but, nonetheless, we cannot expect to put the same question to the people over and over and expect them to get it right every time.I want to say something about Turkey. Broadly speaking, I welcome the decision of the Council but with some reservation and not a great amount of enthusiasm. I appreciate that the motivation of the Austrians was not entirely pure but they did us some service in making the point that, essentially, this is a two-way thing. The people of Turkey and their political taskmasters obviously want to make a decision as to whether they want to be part of the European Union. It is a something the rest of us must also consider. There is a very real question as to whether we can absorb Turkey. If it is a matter of today or tomorrow, the answer must be that we cannot. The political, cultural and social differences are just too great. Turkey is just too big and too poor. The difficulties that would arise if the EU was to try to absorb Turkey tomorrow are too great. It would cause the Union, as it currently exists, to founder.Whether that can alter over a period of ten years of negotiation and change within Turkey is another matter. Very possibly it can do so but we have to at least consider the possibility that perhaps it will not. In ten years, people in France, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands or Ireland might actually not be willing to take that step. The Austrians have at least done us a service by flagging this issue and it is important that we should acknowledge that possibility. A year or two ago I would have argued that we should, perhaps, take the Austrian route and say that privileged partnership is the way to go. I visited Turkey last year and one cannot ignore the fact that anyone of a liberal mind there wants to cling to the notion of EU membership. They feel this quite strongly and are of the view that it is an essential part of making progress within their own country. I do not believe it is possible for us to abandon those people, namely, Prime Minister Erdogan and many others. We met, for example, women's groups, trade unions, people in business, a full range of people with political views as well as people from Kurdistan and elsewhere. One cannot ignore the fact that anyone of a progressive mind in Turkey wants to be part of the European Union and sees membership of it as being an essential anchor towards making progress. I came away feeling that we could not abandon them. We should not pretend, either to them or ourselves, that the process will be easy because clearly it will not.I want to deal briefly with Romania and Bulgaria. If they are not exactly on the fast-track towards EU membership, at least they have only a short time to go. There is some speculation that they may not be ready. If they are not ready, they are not. If this means they have to delay for another year or two, then it is better that they do so. It is necessary for the rest of the Union and for them to be absolutely sure. If one looks at the experience in the aftermath of the Bulgarian election and what has happened there in the past year, it is clear that progress has still to be made and matters should not be rushed. We should not bring them in too early.Similarly, I want to make a point about Croatia. It has been somewhat worrying during the past year or so, looking at the machinations on the margins of the Hague and the war crimes tribunal there. It is as though compliance with the requirements of the tribunal has become a moveable feast. One day Croatia is meeting the requirements and the next day it is not. One cannot escape the conclusion that judgment on whether it is meeting the requirements varies, depending on who is asking the questions. That is simply not good enough. We need to send a clear message to Serbia and Montenegro to the effect that we require full compliance with the requirements of the Hague tribunal.The Leas-Chathaoirleach has indicated that I have one minute left. I am sorry about that because I wanted to make a point that is relevant to this country. When the Union enlarged, we were told — and most of us believed — that there would not be a large influx of people from eastern Europe, tens or hundreds of thousands of people coming here to work. We were wrong. The fact is that there have been approximately 100,000 or so immigrants from the Baltic states and Poland, principally during the past year. This poses serious questions for us, to which we do not yet have answers. To be honest, we do not know what the questions are either. We do not know how many want to stay or how many will come here for two years and go away, hopefully with a pocket full of euro to make better lives for themselves in their home countries. We do not, therefore, know whether we must cater for a transient population of migrant workers or begin to assimilate a long-term population that will stay here. I suggest that we must work on the basis that at least some of these people — even only 10% of them, which is still a significant number — will stay here and transform the manner in which we do things so that they can be assimilated and that they, in turn, assimilate. The evidence so far, purely anecdotal, is that they do not assimilate. It suggests that we are, in fact, getting little Polish communities in different parts of this city. I find that worrying. We are very much in the early stages of this experience and it is new to us. The first stage in dealing with it is to be aware of it. That much at least we should take on board. I again thank the Taoiseach for coming before the House.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I also welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for his efforts as regards the European Presidency and the developments that have taken place. I thank him, too, for his kind remarks concerning the National Forum on Europe.Following on from something Senator McDowell said, the forum does not claim any monopoly on the discussion. I would worry if it were to be given a type of monopolistic position in this debate or if people were to take the view that these matters were being discussed within the National Forum on Europe and not necessarily anywhere else. At best, the forum sees itself as a catalyst and, perhaps, an energiser or facilitator. It is important that the debate should be carried on more widely through society and by people who are sceptical about Europe just as much as those who are not.I congratulate Senator McDowell on the thoughtful nature of his contribution. It is the type of contribution we need. It is not a question of us all being cheerleaders or whatever but of our examining the real difficulties that arise and the importance of dealing with them. I detect no sizeable or even sensible body of opinion in favour of leaving the European Union, although there are different views about how it should be run. My view is that membership of the EU has enabled us to find ourselves as a nation. By pooling a small degree of sovereignty we suddenly found ourselves as a nation psychologically and economically. This has been extremely helpful with regard to developments in Northern Ireland in that Britain and Ireland are equal partners. The Taoiseach has recognised and utilised this development and I congratulate him on his efforts in this regard.As Senator McDowell noted, one of the problems facing us is that a generation has grown up not knowing what it was like not to be a member of the European Union, just as a generation has grown up which does not know what it is like to be poor. Every now and again we need to plug into reality. My main concern about the European Union has always been the likelihood of apathy developing.As chairman of the National Forum on Europe, I do not often involve myself in policy decisions but I wish to touch on two or three decisions. I agree that Turkish accession to the European Union will be extremely difficult to digest and will be a long, slow process that will require a great deal of adjustment on both sides. Nevertheless, having begun the process, it must continue not only on behalf of Turkey and the European Union but because it creates a bridge to the Islamic world.I am rather closer to Senator Quinn's position on the Common Agricultural Policy than that of the Taoiseach. The major social change taking place in Europe must be managed. The impact of our actions on the developing world, particularly Africa, is of such importance as to require that we address the issue of the Common Agricultural Policy.On another point raised by Senator McDowell, if we are to sustain current economic growth, we will need approximately 70,000 to 80,000 people to come here in each of the next ten years. While some of these will be returning Irish people, many more of them will not be Irish. It is vital, therefore, that we begin to address the other side of this equation, namely, how to accommodate this group of people who can and will contribute to society not only in terms of their labour but also the richness of the cultural experience they bring with them.I congratulate the Taoiseach and his officials on the White Paper on the European Constitution which has just arrived on my desk. I took a cursory look at the document which is bright, readable and mercifully free from jargon. It is important that the Taoiseach, all political parties and all organs of civil society sustain the debate on the importance of engaging with Europe, the nature of that engagement and where it is leading Ireland. I thank the Taoiseach for coming before the House and congratulate him on his work.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I understand the Taoiseach must leave and thank him for staying for so long. I welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy. It is important and useful to hold a debate on the European Union in the House on the day the White Paper on the European Constitution has been published. For some years, I have been belly-aching about the tendency to launch major Government papers outside the House and thereby exclude the House from the process. The Seanad has a role, albeit a small one, in the debate on the European Union. One of the most successful initiatives taken by the House in recent years was to invite MEPs to participate in a debate on Europe earlier in the year. This was a useful experiment which should be replicated in future.Senator McDowell made an interesting contribution in which he referred to early estimates of the number of citizens from the new member states who would come to work in Ireland following accession. There is a straightforward explanation for the decision of such large numbers of them to come here. Unemployment, particularly among young people, is substantially higher in the new member states than here. I recently read in a magazine that Poland has the worst unemployment problem, including youth joblessness, in the European Union. It comes as no great surprise to learn that many Poles are coming to Ireland and other member states where work is available. How many of them would stay if the employment market were not as flexible as it is now?I concur with Senator McDowell that segregation in our cities would be an unwelcome development. The emergence of distinctive Polish or Latvian neighbourhoods would not be the way to integrate the new communities. This issue must be discussed now to ensure communities moving into Ireland are fully integrated.I have an open mind on the issue of Turkish accession which has been raised by many Senators on all sides. I disagree with Senator Minihan, however, because we cannot escape the fact that concepts such as the separation of state and church, universal suffrage, gender equality and freedom of the press are Christian and European ideas which were developed largely in response to the awful killings we saw in the First and Second World Wars. Turkey will have to measure up to a variety of criteria which reflect these European ideas — I make no apology for describing them as such — of which we can be proud. Turkish membership of the European Union is a strong possibility and has clear advantages, for example, it would offer a way into the Islamic world and the east and constitute a recognition of the role of Islam in the new Europe. Countries joining the European Union must, however, subscribe to the inherent democratic norms and values, including respect for human rights, which are widely accepted in EU jurisdictions.I support the applications of Romania and Bulgaria to join the European Union. Given that both countries were in the eastern bloc, why has the economy of Hungary taken off in the past 20 years while that of Romania has not? We must encourage Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU and ensure they meet the criteria we have set.Senators have referred to a new wave of euroscepticism, a development inextricably linked to a rise in neo-nationalism. Given that the Hapsburg empire lost out to the Turks and vice versa, it comes as no surprise to learn that of all the EU members Austria objects most to Turkish membership. The issue is rooted in the neo-nationalism at the heart of Europe. In many respects the rise in Sinn Féin is no different from the rise in Jean-Marie Le Pen’s Front National in France, Jörg Haider’s Freedom Party in Austria and the British National Party in Britain. It is a wicked form of the most virulent neo-nationalism because it is based on a segregationist notion. It reflects the words of D. P. Moran that Ireland should be for the Irish and the John Bull notion of Britain for the British. There is virtually no difference between the neo-nationalism of Sinn Féin, the British National Party and Mr. Le Pen’s Front National. We must cherish the everyday benefits of the European Union alluded to by Senator McDowell and continue to remind citizens of them.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Like my colleagues, I welcome the Taoiseach's attendance in the House and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy, to the House. I emphasise the importance of our continuing to focus on European issues.I was pleased that the Taoiseach gave a confident reassertion of the importance of Europe to our ongoing prosperity. He also promoted the EU constitution, which is a rather courageous position when one considers mainstream European political and media thinking would seem to suggest, depending on the part of Europe, that the EU constitution is all but dead or stillborn. There are continuing debates in Europe on the way forward following the rejection of the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands, for example, that if the 95% of it about housekeeping issues and administrative detail were dropped, the more complex issues relating to common foreign policy and defence issues could move ahead.I might also suggest that one of the failings of the concept was calling it a constitution in the first place.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Yes.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	94	That was negative. The reason I suggest that is because about 12 months ago I had the experience of being in Norway where I spoke with various Norwegian politicians and inquired why Norway is of, but not part of, the European Union. Norway cannot be in the European Union because its people rejected joining twice in referenda. The margin, in the early 1970s and again in the 1990s, was much the same, a rejection by 52% and 48%, but it was suggested by practically all of the politicians across the political divide to whom I spoke that it was rejected because it was referred to as the European Union. The folk memory in Norway of the union between Norway and Sweden was not positive and, therefore, the people were not too keen on entering something they perceived would somehow erode their nationality and sovereignty. There are, of course, echoes of the debate and argument in this country in the 1970s. I make that point for what it is worth. Politicians must grasp the nettle on this matter at European level.I can understand why the Taoiseach is taking the position he is. He has come out unequivocally, unambiguously and, as I stated earlier, somewhat courageously. It seems to me this is because, as was referred to in Senator Ormonde's excellent contribution earlier, the Taoiseach invested such a significant amount of time, effort and credibility in a statesmanlike tour de force as President of the European Union at the time this constitution was being debated; he effectively pulled the disparate parts together. I can understand he probably feels it is his baby in that sense. I do not wish to minimise that perceived feeling he may have of ownership with his wider responsibilities as Taoiseach and the fact that he has taken this position, one which we all would support, in the national interest.There is widespread concern about enlargement and I am glad the Taoiseach referred to this in his speech. The rejection of the referenda in France and the Netherlands was rather complex, as are most referenda. Senator McDowell correctly touched on the inherent flaw in holding a referendum and the concept of a referendum. To those who feel I am somehow assaulting one of the bastions of our democracy, I would suggest that all politicians realise that the question asked is not always the question answered, and that is what happens in these instances.The widespread concern arises from the social directive. While the Taoiseach commented on not having sterile debate on different social systems at the forthcoming EU Heads of State meeting in London, questions must be asked about the EU and about its competitiveness. The Lisbon Agenda, which was referred to, still has not advanced to the point where Europe can provide prosperity for all its citizens.Two issues which deserve more emphasis, certainly from an Irish perspective, are the significant roles of the EU in overseas development aid and in human rights. As one of my colleagues in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs stated, Ireland does not do wars; we do peace and human rights. Ireland has a central role to play, not only in shaping the Europe of the future in the constitutional debate but also in pushing out the boat and advancing those issues and values which have been the European Union's beacon of attraction for all the member states that joined in the recent past and for those countries, not only the candidate countries but even those in south-east Europe and beyond, who wish to join. It is about human rights values. It is about our role in ensuring rights for those who are less well off, whether under the CAP or overseas development aid. That is the value of Europe and that is why I would be, as Senator Quinn stated aptly, a committed European.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	95	We should express our thanks to the Taoiseach for giving of his time here again this afternoon. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the debate. I appreciate his being here. I am sure he will take back what we have to say.This kind of debate, with five minute contributions, is lively and good. I have listened to it in my office for the past hour and it flowed quite well. It is a tight timeframe but it is good. We should have more such debates.I was in France this year on the day of the referendum on the European constitution. That night I met five people who told me they had voted against the European constitution, which was not surprising. The surprising piece was contained in the next sentence of each of them. Each one of the five was in favour of the European constitution but they all had voted against it for different reasons. There are two lessons to be learned. Senator Mooney is correct. My history teacher in Dingle long ago always said that the most powerful person in a referendum was the one who wrote out the question, and he was so correct. If the question is wrong, the answer will never be correct.In future we should hold a series of referenda, not just one referendum on something so complicated. I realise this is a terrible future to behold but if one does not take an aspect of the European constitution — I agree with the point made about calling it a constitution, which it is not, but one may call it what we wishes — and put that part to the people for stated reasons, then we will get a result similar to those received on many occasions. In the past three referenda we got this coalition of extreme right and extreme left. We got people who had nothing in common coming together opposing it and we made it easy for them to do so. We should not do that again. One thing we should do is break down the issues and deal with them one by one.In that regard, we should observe how people perceive Europe. On the point Senator McDowell made earlier, people see themselves as European. They are comfortable being European, whatever that is. One does not hear people in the pub saying that we want to get out of Europe. It is not happening there and that is not where the debate is taking place.The Taoiseach made reference to Turkey. The Turkish issue is a classic example of that of which I speak. There is a huge majority against Turkey's accession and I could give at least six reasons for this. First, it is a Muslim state and a considerable number of European Christians are opposed to the idea of a Muslim state joining the European Union. These Christians will never say so but that is what they believe. Second, a significant number of racists do not want these Asians. There are the geographers who will tell us that Turkey is not part of Europe, which finishes at the Dardanelles. There are also the people who are worried about the size of Turkey. Then there are workers who are genuinely worried about their jobs if 70 million people suddenly become available to the European workforce. These are different objecting groups and they must be dealt with one by one. Then there is the issue of Cyprus. Did anyone else note that during the debate on whether the EU would start the accession talks with Turkey two weeks ago there was no mention of Turkey's attitude towards Cyprus? The idea of an EU member state which did not fully recognise another EU member state would be untenable. In fairness, Turkey has made more moves than Cyprus in trying to alleviate that. The House will recall that the referendum on that island last year was accepted by the Turkish end and rejected by the other end, contrary to all expectations a year earlier. We must look at these issues and also tell the Turkish authorities that they keep doing everything wrong. They deal with every problem the wrong way. They should just simply recognise what they must do. They should out-wit and out-strategise the people who are delighted to see them making errors.There are issues about Europe that bother people. The euro has been the greatest success story of the European Union and people like it. The aspect of the European Union that has driven people mad is, as I mentioned here this morning, that we no longer can have local market producers. Such markets exist in every other place in Europe. Every small town in France has such a market where people may sell their own vegetables. Each day in north Dublin people dump the kind of vegetables that are polished up in Provence and presented as being perfect. They would not be allowed on the Dublin market because they do not meet European Union legislation regulations. The position is the same as regards meat, the VRT on cars and credit cards. I cannot get my credit card at the cheapest place in Europe because we are tied by the regulations. Why can I not transfer euro from one country to another without undergoing an extraordinarily difficult, expensive and complex procedure with different banks?Many Irish people travel abroad two or three times each year. Why must they queue up at customs? Why do we not say "Goodbye" to the British, as we did in the case of the euro, and buy into the Schengen Agreement? The situation is too complex and complicated so we should take the next step and move on. These are some of the steps we could take to make people more at ease and bring forward the principles of the Treaty of Rome, namely, free movement of people, labour and capital.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The constitutional treaty was drafted following a uniquely open and transparent process and represented a fairly carefully balanced compromise between the member states. No state got everything it wanted. I thought, for example, that there should be a reference in the preamble to our Christian heritage, not to make it a Christian constitution but rather to establish an historical fact. Instead, we end up with a Masonic preamble which refers to the Enlightenment and other such matters.There was widespread consensus following the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda that reflection was required across Europe. In the words of the June 2005 declaration of the European Council, a period should "enable a broad debate to take place in each of our countries, involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments and political parties". As Members are aware, from the experience of referenda in Ireland, particularly in more recent times, it can be a challenge to our collective efforts to engage the wider public in debates on European affairs. I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of that fact. Perhaps this has occurred because we have neglected to underline the fact that European affairs are increasingly domestic affairs. Collective and co-ordinated European action is often the only means to address domestic issues across the Union.It is important to recall that there are developments that impact on us all which are worldwide rather than EU specific. I refer here to the challenges and opportunities of globalisation, to which the Taoiseach referred. It is also important that we be mindful of the need to address issues at the most appropriate level for corrective action, the so-called principle of subsidiarity. Action might be best carried out at the level of the region, the nation, the Union, or a combination of all three. On occasion, initiatives will only be effective if given a global perspective. In that context, I refer, in particular, to the environment and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.It was appropriate that the constitutional treaty sought to advance the existing work of the national Parliaments with regard to monitoring in respect of the principle of subsidiarity. The role of the National Parliaments with regard to subsidiarity was previously recognised in the Amsterdam treaty. The Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny takes its role under the current legal arrangements very seriously in this regard. It is regrettable that there is not a greater appreciation of its valuable work and the dedicated efforts of its members.I am aware, from working with colleagues in other European affairs committees in the national parliaments of the Union that meet under the umbrella of COSAC, the  Conférence des Organes Spécialisés dans les Affaires Communautaires, that the issues of particular concern across the Union include the free movement of services and people and the neighbourhood policy. The latter seeks to include all the countries throughout Europe in a stabilisation pact ensuring stability, security and prosperity. It includes almost all the countries that touch on Europe in some way. In June 2004, at the final meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council during Ireland’s Presidency of the Union, a decision was taken to include Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. In this regard, it was particularly timely this morning to meetthe Georgian Foreign Minister, Ms SalomeZourabichvili, to exchange views on how the Union might develop structured relations with her country and the wider region.Ireland has been economically and culturally enriched by the presence of people from the newer member states. Freer movement brings many pluses but also challenges that must be addressed. These are practical issues that are being explored by the Joint Committee on European Affairs in its work on migration. This is an example of how the period of reflection facilitates the addressing of the concerns and worries of citizens.I intended to refer to the National Forum on Europe but Senator Maurice Hayes has already done so. The European Council has indicated that it will return to the matter of the constitutional treaty in the first half of 2006 to make an overall assessment of the national debates and to agree on how to proceed. It is, therefore, particularly timely that we are considering this valuable contribution to the debate.We should note that the consensus reached at the time of the writing of the constitution, created from the European Convention and the IGC, was not sufficiently democratic. The consensus must now go deeper into political society. We should not be afraid of this. There is much happening that we can recommend and of which we can be proud. I am conscious that the Taoiseach and his colleagues face a vital period in terms of negotiations on the EU financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013. I thank him and his Ministers for their involvement and for their determined approach to the debate so far. I wish them well with their negotiations, which are now on the agenda for December's European Council.The European project has served Europe well. It has allowed the peoples and nations of Europe to unite in co-operation in a vision of peace and prosperity. As the European conflicts and wars of the last century fade from memory into history, it is timely that we now reflect on the future of Europe. I am confident that this White Paper will become a framework for future discussions and greatly assist in clarifying the issues at stake. I look forward to continuing to play an active part in this ongoing debate..
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, and his official. I also welcome the White Paper, which I have not yet had the chance to examine.One of the respects in which we have a superb public service is with regard to Europe. Tremendous commitment is found across Departments that is a blend of idealism and enlightened self interest. We are exceptionally fortunate in that regard. This showed through when we were able, where others failed, to get agreement on the draft constitutional treaty.The undoubted malaise in regard to the constitution is both economic and political. Economic stagnation, particularly in continental Europe, has much to do with our current situation. The outcome of the German general election, in terms of government formation, is not unsatisfactory. I hope a grand coalition continuing along the path started a year or so ago by the outgoing Chancellor Schröeder will succeed in returning business confidence into the German economy. This is important for all of us because that engine has been missing. There is also a certain political malaise, perhaps more in France than in Germany, where, following enlargement, there is no longer the feeling that France, or the Franco-German partnership, is running the show. There is some uncertainty as to from where the impetus comes.It is right that there should be a period of reflection on the constitutional treaty. If one were to attempt to force ahead at this point, one would only get further rebuffs. I sense that people here may argue that we could say no to the treaty because other countries have done so and, therefore, there would be no serious consequences, which puts us in danger of finding ourselves in a situation similar to that which obtained following the first referendum on the Nice Treaty. This would not be helpful.I was interested to note that the Taoiseach expressed belief and confidence that the constitutional treaty would, sooner or later, be back on the agenda. I suspect that one or two elections in continental Europe may have to take place before this is possible. Unlike Senator Maurice Hayes, I am implacably more on the side of the Taoiseach than on the side of Senator Quinn as regards the Common Agricultural Policy. Without casting aspersions on anyone's idealism, it must be borne in mind that Senator Quinn comes from a commercial sector of the economy that has rather different interests from the productive agricultural sector. I do not buy the argument that the Common Agricultural Policy as a whole is detrimental to developing countries. The ACP countries, especially the Caribbean countries, have made it clear they are not in favour of the reforms of the sugar beet industry being proposed by the European Commission. They have explained that the present system, under which they can buy in, suits them much better.I applaud the Government on its courageous position on issues like the EU's accession negotiations with Turkey. As the Taoiseach acknowledged in his speech, many people have reservations about the opening of negotiations, which I think is the correct thing to do. It is clear that Turkish accession will be possible only if a series of conditions which are not right at the moment come right in the future. I am glad Ireland has taken its position on the appropriate side of the argument.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I thank the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for agreeing so freely to come to the House for this debate when it was mooted. If Senators think they have been short-changed by the allocation of time during this debate, I assure them that the decision to impose tighter speaking slots was taken after more than ten Senators were unable to speak during the debate on Northern Ireland last week. We had no idea that we would run out of people wanting to contribute to this debate. Perhaps it is a reflection of Senators' priorities, although I am not sure what to make of it. I think punchy debates of this nature are better than the long and rambling debates to which we have been subjected on many occasions. It is good to ask people to express their thoughts in a tighter timeframe. I appreciate the Taoiseach's decision to take time to come to the Seanad on two successive Thursdays.This debate has been very useful. We usually hear about EU issues when a crisis is developing, or when a referendum is forthcoming. People act like busy bees on such occasions. I am glad that the White Paper on the European Constitution has been published, as it will provoke argument and debate, including on the letters page of The Irish Times. I am concerned about the failure to promote European studies in our secondary schools. I am aware that the history of the EU can be studied within the history curriculum, but we are not promoting EU matters in an adequate fashion. Young people should be encouraged to initiate debates about the whole European project.I agree with Senator Mooney that the decision to use the convoluted and incomprehensible phrase "constitutional treaty on Europe" was unfortunate. When people hear the phrase "constitutional treaty", they think of this country's Constitution and argue that we should not give it up in favour of some European carry-on. The title that was given to a document that merely brings together some ideas which have been accepted by the people of this country in various referenda is too heavy and weighty. The grandiose title in question was frightening for some people.Although this country has woken up to the fact that many people feel removed from the EU and find its business incomprehensible, it has not been able to make it clear to people exactly what the EU is all about by tearing away the veils of incomprehension which mask the entire EU project. I am not sure that Mr. Barroso's symbolic gesture of tearing up 70 EU directives will encourage more people to favour the EU or help to make EU matters clearer to European citizens. I do not like the idea that much of the time I spent working on legislation and statutory instruments to bring various EU directives into force has gone up in flames. I do not think the burning and tearing up of the directives is symbolic or important. It will not invoke a feeling of European comradeship among EU citizens. Mr. Barroso's gesture, which was an attempt to be fashionable, reminded me of the comments of the former Tory Minister, Mr. Michael Heseltine, who had a big mane of hair, about tearing away the layers of bureaucracy. I imagine that some adviser, with apologies to the nice adviser who is present in the Chamber, suggested to Mr. Barroso that he would be a wow and everybody would say "hear, hear" if he burned some papers.We have come to love many of the European Union's values, such as human rights, employee rights and parity. I met a man the other night who took a case to the European Court of Justice. His case related to quite a small matter — it was not the kind of thing that would attract headlines. When he was unable to obtain justice in this jurisdiction, he took his case to the European Court of Justice and got a favourable ruling. He told me that his experience has convinced him that the EU works. Greater publicity should be given to matters which can be explored and decided on at EU level.This is a healthy debate. I am sure that the White Paper on the European Constitution is excellent. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's closing remarks.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis an Seanad as ucht an díospóireachta iontaigh maidir leis an Aontas Eorpach a bhí againn sa Teach inniu. Táimid an-bhuíoch don Taoiseach as ucht teacht anseo chun páirt mhór a ghlacadh agus ceannasaíocht a thabhairt don díospóireacht. It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad. I followed the earlier part of this debate from my office before I came to the House to listen to the contributions of Senators. I thank Members from all sides of the House for the positive contributions they have made this afternoon. It is obvious that the European Union is of great importance to all Senators. It is clear they are focused on and committed to the European project and have a fine understanding of it. They seem to have a clear vision of where the EU is going and what it should be about. Senators have lauded the contribution the EU has made to the development of Ireland since it joined the Union in 1973.I pay tribute to the Taoiseach and thank him for coming to the Seanad to lead this debate, for making a significant contribution to it and for officially launching the White Paper on the European Constitution on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland at this important time of reflection for the European Union. The European Council of the Heads of States and Governments has decided that we need to reflect on the failure of the proposed EU constitution to be accepted by the electorates of France and the Netherlands. It is important at this time to reflect on the progress that has been made by the Union and the path it should take into the future. We need to consider how quickly the EU has reached its current status. There has been a substantial expansion not only of the EU's membership, but also of its population. We should think about the EU's future borders. We cannot continue to expand the EU in an ad hoc manner without considering the ramifications of such machinations on the existing member states. The period of reflection should be used to ponder the many changes which have taken place as well as the great challenges and opportunities which are faced by all member states.As the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I had a very small input into the White Paper on the European Constitution, which is a fine document. I pay tribute to the work done in this regard by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the management officials within the Department of Foreign Affairs. I refer in particular to the outgoing director general of the Department's European affairs division, Mr. Montgomery, who is now in charge of the Department's political division. He played a key role in writing, co-ordinating and putting the final touches to the White Paper. It should be noted that the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs worked on the White Paper without any external assistance — it was an in-house operation. I pay special tribute to the Department's political director, Mr. Montgomery, who made a huge contribution to the White Paper. It is an outstanding document that is a credit to him and his colleagues in the Department who helped to compile the document ahead of its ultimate analysis and ratification at Government level. Now that it is a public document, the citizens of this country have an opportunity to engage with it and I hope they will do so. In particular, I would like those of us involved in political life, such as the Members of the Oireachtas and the members of local authorities, to examine the White Paper.Although the European Union is critically important, we seem to take it seriously only when a crisis or a problem is developing, as the Leader of the House said. It is a part of our everyday lives that has a key role to play. It is critically important that we recognise that it makes a massive contribution to equality, economic development, market opportunities and the transfer of resources. We need to continue to speak about the EU and to get our message across in primary schools, secondary schools, third level institutions, business organisations, voluntary bodies and political movements. That is also critically important.We must all embrace this debate. Nobody has single ownership of it because it is a collective responsibility. European meetings are held throughout the country and in this regard I pay particular tribute to the Forum on Europe under the outstanding leadership of Senator Maurice Hayes. It is important that we all support the forum and, as elected political representatives at national and local level, that we engage with the public so they have a better understanding of what Europe is about and where it is going. I appeal to everybody to use this opportunity for reflection to study the document. We must engage with and support the forum in its efforts to get the message across to the people, which is important for us all.I wish to reinforce Ireland's strong and outstanding leadership pertaining to European issues but particularly to the Common Agricultural Policy. It is in this regard that the Taoiseach in particular has given such outstanding leadership. He is a former President of the Union, universally respected within the European Union for his negotiating skills and wonderful leadership, and probably the most respected leader in Europe at this time, when leadership is critically important. The CAP has been critical to Ireland with regard to the massive transfer of resources we receive, the modern agricultural industry we have developed, our production capacities and our ability to supply not only European but world markets. It is critically important we maintain the CAP and speak with a united voice.I am pleased to represent Ireland in an observer capacity as part of the Friends of Cohesion group of countries. At this stage some 20 countries have reached agreement that the financial perspectives negotiations which took place up to 30 June last indicated the best way forward for the future. The 20 countries believe we should get a decision during this term, under the UK Presidency. I hope this can be achieved in December so Europe will have the financial and political leadership and sustainability that is critically important for the future, and that any uncertainty will be eliminated as a matter of urgency.On behalf of the Taoiseach, I thank all Members for their contribution to this debate on the European Union. I hope that, collectively, we can encourage the citizens of the nation to engage with regard to the critical role that Europe has played in the development of our country, the critical role Ireland can play within Europe and the great challenges and opportunities ahead. Working together in a consensual way, I hope we make our contribution to Europe and, in turn, that Europe will continue to support us in our economic development and the creation of equality of opportunity for all of the citizens on this island and across Europe in the decades ahead, which will be challenging, exciting and rewarding.

I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely. A week does not go by but newspapers are beset with rumours of nefarious happenings at Shannon Airport, that flights to and from the US are carrying cargoes of prisoners and, more particularly, that such aeroplanes are exempt from carrying manifests of cargo, passengers, crew and all that is on board. As the House is aware, all other flights must carry manifests, as a ship would. I need to have this matter clarified. I hope the reply will be definitive and will put an end to the matter. However, I fear I will get a half-answer. If so, the matter will have to be pursued through other channels. I look forward to the Minister's contribution.

It is an important issue and should be fully clarified, as she requested. I hope the response prepared for me will adequately deal with her concerns. Should it not, I would be happy to arrange an appropriate meeting with relevant officials so the matter could be fully clarified.For the purposes of this debate, American civil aircraft travelling through Shannon can be broken down into three categories: first, normal scheduled and charter operations by US airlines; second, operations carrying US soldiers and munitions; and third, ad hoc flights arriving at or transiting through Shannon. Military aircraft travelling through Irish airports are regulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs.With regard to the first category — normal scheduled or charter flights by US airlines — the crew, passengers and cargo are subject to stringent security procedures in the US before they arrive in Ireland and, of course, are always subject to the normal border and customs controls at Shannon airport, without exception. With regard to the second category — operations by US airlines carrying US soldiers, munitions and weapons — each application for such a flight is subject to detailed scrutiny by my Department and by other Departments, and each application is submitted to the Minister for Transport for approval.It is worth going into more detail about these flights, for the information of the House and to reassure the House that careful consideration is given to each one. Flights by civil aircraft carrying weapons or munitions are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport. Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended in 1989, civilian aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions over Ireland or into Irish airports unless they receive an exemption from the Minister. The existence of this long-standing prohibition on the carriage of weapons or munitions is listed in the aeronautical information publication, an Irish Aviation Authority publication that specifies the rules and regulations that must be observed by aircraft flying in Irish airspace. In addition, when it became clear in 2002 that there were increased numbers of US troops moving through Shannon, the Department of Transport issued reminders about the prohibition specifically to the airlines transiting through Shannon with US troops and munitions or weapons. Procedures were put in place so that airlines wishing to use Shannon for these types of flights would have to submit a detailed application in each case. I can confirm that the Department of Transport has received full co-operation from the airlines concerned.I would like to explain what happens when the Department of Transport receives a request for an exemption from the prohibition of carrying weapons or munitions. As a standard procedure my Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Irish Aviation Authority. The Department of Defence is also informed in each case. Each of these bodies that are consulted fulfils a different and specific role in regard to the matter. The Department of Foreign Affairs advises whether there are any foreign policy reasons why the exemption should not be given. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform advises whether there are security reasons for refusing the exemption and it also informs the Garda Síochána. The IAA gives advice as to whether dangerous goods, such as munitions or explosives, are being carried in a safe manner.On receipt of the views of the two Departments and the IAA the Department of Transport prepares a recommendation for consideration by the Minister. If there are any objections to the issue of the exemption, the Minister will refuse the exemption. In the majority of cases, the exemption is granted. The main reasons for refusals are because an application comes in very late or because the flight may be carrying munitions, such as landmines, to which Ireland is, for foreign policy reasons, opposed. There are no exceptions to these rules. Any aircraft carrying munitions or weapons must apply to my Department for exemption.The third category of flights concerns ad hoc flights to or from the US. Generally, where these flights are carrying passengers into Ireland for the purposes of business or tourism, each flight must apply to my Department for a flight authorisation, where details of the aircraft and flight schedule must be submitted for approval. The documentation is examined by officials in the Department as well as by the IAA and if everything is in order, the flight can be approved. There is no requirement in Irish or in International law for a list of the passengers to be submitted, although when the passengers arrive they are subject to the normal border and customs controls when they leave the airport. The commander of the aircraft must have documentation concerning the crew and baggage on board should it by required by the authorities in Shannon.Where flights are simply stopping at Shannon for technical reasons, such as to refuel, there is no requirement under international or Irish law for those aircraft coming into Ireland to notify the Department of Transport in advance.As Senator O'Rourke said, there has been some speculation in the press regarding the carriage of prisoners through Shannon going to Guantanamo Bay or elsewhere. The Department of Foreign Affairs has raised this matter with the US and I understand that the US authorities have confirmed to the Department of Foreign Affairs that prisoners have not been transported through Irish airports to Guantanamo or elsewhere. The US also confirms that it would not use Irish airports for this purpose in the future without seeking the authorisation of the Irish authorities.I hope the reply is somewhat informative and helpful to Senator O'Rourke. The Senator will understand from the reply that Departments other than mine are involved in this matter. That is why I am happy to offer further clarification to Senator O'Rourke or to any Senator.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House. I am happy he is here but I would have thought the Minister would have attended because this is an issue which has been exercising many people, not least the last leader of the Labour Party, as evidenced for 15 minutes on radio on Sunday. I do not say that to castigate the Minister of State, for whom, as he is aware, I have the height of respect. I regard the scant rather than hard information given as a lot of waffle. The Minister of State said, "The Department of Foreign Affairs has raised this matter with the US and I understand the US authorities have confirmed to the Department of Foreign Affairs that prisoners have not been transported through Irish airports". I wanted to know if such aeroplanes had been boarded by gardaí or security people to check what was on board. Do we just blindly accept the word given? I am rather dissatisfied with the reply but I accept it is what the Minister of State was given and I thank him for it.
