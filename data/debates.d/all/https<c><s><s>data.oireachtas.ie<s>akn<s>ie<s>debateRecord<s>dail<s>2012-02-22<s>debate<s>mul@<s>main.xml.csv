#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Despite all the election promises and Government spin, many people's experience of the health service is becoming worse by the day.  Dismissing the board of the Health Service Executive without putting in place an alternative has prompted inquiries as to who is in charge of the health service.  Many medical card holders, particularly those with chronic illnesses, are waiting far too long for renewals.  This is unacceptable and unnecessary.  The HSE service plans that have been published provide details in respect of hundreds of beds being closed in acute hospitals and, critically, in community nursing units throughout the country.  Dr. Ronan O'Sullivan has articulated the fact that there has been a sharp increase in the number of children who are waiting on trolleys in paediatric hospitals.  Dr. O'Sullivan has also stated that the situation is worse than ever and that bed closures are the cause of this overcrowding.Since the National Treatment Purchase Fund was subsumed into the special delivery unit, SDU, waiting lists and waiting times have increased dramatically by over 47%.  This means that 11,500 people are waiting more than six months for treatment.  The increase to which I refer occurred over a very short period as a result of a policy change.  Almost 45,000 people are awaiting day procedures at present and some 16,000 are awaiting inpatient surgery.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund had reduced waiting times in the vast majority of cases to between three to six months.  It had put in place clear targets and appropriate measures and had a dramatic impact on waiting times.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Does the Deputy have a question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The National Treatment Purchase Fund worked.  However, the moneys allocated to it have now disappeared into the big black hole of the SDU and the wider system.  As a result, waiting lists have become longer.  Masking the real story, rather than tackling the lists, has become the priority.Will the Government consider reinstating the National Treatment Purchase Fund, with an exclusive focus on reducing waiting times and waiting lists for people who desperately require surgery?  Will it resolve the issue relating to medical card renewals for those with chronic illnesses?  Will it deal with the overcrowding in paediatric hospitals?  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees that such overcrowding is unacceptable.  There are clear alternatives available which would assist in resolving this problem.  I am of the view that the Government should consider exempting bed closures in paediatric hospitals.  Those are the three key questions I wish to put to the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Deputy Martin has raised a range of issues which are clearly of concern to the Government.  Those issues relate to the structure of the health service and also to the way in which services are delivered to patients, either those in hospital or those who are unfortunate enough to be on waiting lists.  I listened to a radio interview this morning with a paediatric professional from Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  The individual in question made a very reasonable case and pointed out that what has happened in respect of adult waiting lists began in a small way and then just grew to unacceptable proportions.  He made a very reasonable point to the effect that we should consider and deal with waiting lists relating to children.  He also highlighted the fact that it is easier to deal with short-term illnesses, be they respiratory infections or whatever, that children contract than it is to deal with those which affect adults.  The point he made is one which the special delivery unit and the Minister for Health will be anxious to examine.  The proposition the individual in question put forward in the context of attempting to deal with this matter before it grows in the same way that the problem relating to adult waiting lists did should be given due consideration.As Deputy Martin is aware, paediatric hospitals work together and take a unified approach.  Children are obliged to await admission in personal cubicles or isolation rooms in circumstances where beds are not yet available.  Those children who are admitted have access to the full range of specialist care when they are in emergency departments.  I understand that the three Dublin hospitals work very closely together in order that children can, where necessary, be admitted very quickly.  The hospitals have a single approach to bed capacity and a joint escalation plan is also in place.  I also understand that the HSE's regional director of operations and its clinical director, Dr. Costigan, is covering the three hospitals and is arranging to meet representatives of the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine as soon as possible.  The HSE has already started the roll-out of national paediatric clinical programmes under the lead of Professor Nicholson.Deputy Martin referred to medical cards.  I understand that matters in this regard have been alleviated to an extent in that medical cards will continue to be valid until people's applications have been dealt with, one way or the other.  I have asked Deputies to highlight individual cases and I intend to visit the medical card section.  The process relating to medical cards should not be operating in the way it is at present.  I must stress, however, that in many cases the information submitted may not be clear or may be insufficient.  The personnel who work in the medical card section are more than anxious to have the process streamlined in order that they can operate in a professional and very efficient manner.  I hope we will be able to reach that point quite quickly.The special delivery unit established by the Minister for Health is specifically focused on ensuring competency and reducing waiting lists and trolley times.  It is also focused on dealing with cases where people have been waiting for over 12 months.  I read reports in some newspapers in respect of people waiting four years for procedures relating to varicose veins and two years for orthopaedic assessment.  I do not have evidence of this.  Like the Minister, I would welcome details regarding the cases that are being highlighted in order that action might be taken in respect of them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Taoiseach did not answer my question on waiting times.  The 12 month period was a reinvention by the Minister to cover the fact that the international target of six months was the target set for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and that the vast majority of categories had come within the period of three to six months under its stewardship.  What has happened is a con job.  The €85 million allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been subsumed by the special delivery unit which uses it for a variety of purposes.  We have gone back to the days when there were perverse incentives and hospitals that did not deliver efficiently and on time were rewarded.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund had clear measurable targets and was achieving clear results.  Will the Taoiseach reinstate it with its exclusive focus on waiting times because this would mean a better experience for those on surgical waiting lists?  That is the key point.With regard to medical cards, it is not good enough that the Taoiseach will visit the unit to gain a photographic experience.  The bottom line is-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Deputy is over time.  Will he, please, put a question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Last week I raised a number of issues.  The Taoiseach's office got back to me on a particular case, which I acknowledge.  However, it should not have to come to this.  As soon as one case was referred to the Taoiseach, I was made aware of another of people having to wait too long and getting bad results from the centre.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	8	This needs to be sorted out.  This morning a consultant was speaking about emergency medicine in paediatric care, not waiting times.  The issue of emergency medicine needs to be sorted out through dealing with a bed capacity issue in paediatric hospitals.  It can and should be done immediately.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	9	If it is of interest to the Deputy, I have no intention of announcing when I plan to visit the medical card unit.  I am not interested in that type of operation.  What I am interested in is ensuring people throughout the country who lodge applications for a medical card or to have one renewed will be dealt with swiftly, efficiently and professionally.

I have received representations from many of my own Deputies.  The problem became acute when an application received was deemed to be incomplete and sent back to seek further information.  A response to such an application might not have been received for a long time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	13	We are speaking about 75 year olds who generally are entitled to have their medical card automatically renewed.  In one case the waiting period was four months.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I understand changes have been made after applications have been received to continue medical card coverage until they are dealt with.  Therefore, there should not be a situation where, as the Deputy pointed out, people fear they will not receive their medicines because their medical card have not been renewed.  I hope this issue is being sorted out by the personnel working in the unit.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	20	It is terrible for patients who, in some circumstances, can be on a trolley for a considerable amount of time.  However, it is nothing new.  Deputy Martin made the comment way back when he was Minister for Health about ending waiting lists permanently.  The number of adults waiting for more than six months rose between the end of 2010 and June 2011 which reflected the difficulties experienced in the health system.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Government has undermined the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That is what has happened.  The fund is being buried by the Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The total number waiting at the end of June was 11,200 and at the end of August,12,000.  Between August and December the number decreased to 11,688, a drop of just over 5% in four months.  It is obvious the special delivery unit began to make an impact on waiting times.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The number has increased by 47%.

The Government is selling off successful self-financing commercial State companies such as Bord Gais and the ESB.  Instead of flogging off the State's assets to earn a quick buck, it should make commercial State companies part of the solution in creating jobs and generating growth.  Both Government parties - bad enough Fine Gael but mór mo náire le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre - have stated the troika is making them do it.  Sinn Féin has met the troika and its members have told us that while they believe in privatisation, they do not assert - they state it is a matter for the Government - that the memorandum of understanding binds the Labour Party and Fine Gael to following this course of action.  It is the Government's decision and well may the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources smile.  He is the Labour Party Minister who will give away what is left of our assets.

It was made public that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would give details of the decision at a press conference this morning.  It is important for the Deputy to understand the original intention was that every cent that might accrue from the sale of State assets would go towards debt reduction.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Every cent was to go towards debt reduction.  Yesterday the Government decided on the sale of State assets, not in a fire sale but for the optimum amount at an appropriate time, to reach a target of €3 billion.  The outcome of the discussions between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Finance and the troika was that once the figure from the disposal of State assets reached more than €1 billion, a figure of one third would apply.  In achieving a figure of €3 billion in the sale of State assets the State would have €1 billion to invest in job creation initiatives.With regard to the State assets mentioned by the Deputy in the energy market, the intention is that when the Government decides on the details, there will be a real impact in terms of competitiveness in the market which will be in the interests of consumers and the economy generally.  It is not intended to dispose of everything associated with these assets.  In the area of energy, it is the energy element of Bord Gáis and some of the power generation facility within the ESB that will be involved.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will consult and in due course will bring to Cabinet his recommendations for the disposal of that element of power generation within the ESB.

I do not envisage that any of this will happen this year but I envisage the commencement and realisation of some of the sale of State assets in 2013.

Today we heard there are historically high numbers of children in sick and dangerous condition on trolleys; that is the matter I wanted to raise.  However, I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was to make this announcement outside the House.  Is there something odd in that it takes a leader of Sinn Féin to tell this Chamber what the Government is doing, or that the Government does not tell Deputies what is happening?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	57	It was on national radio.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I ask Deputies to show some courtesy to speakers and not have a conversation across the floor interrupting people.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I congratulate the Taoiseach on delivering 1,000 jobs to Deputy Adams's constituency in County Louth.  Jobs are a success story for the Government this week.  I welcome that some of the privatisation money will go to job creation.  We should congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government for achieving that and it is right that we should do so on both counts.  However, I issue a little warning.  Although the Taoiseach, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the IDA have very successfully delivered jobs this week, I am very worried, as many Members should be, about another project which will lose jobs.  This is the project, revived this week, whereby the State will pass the cost of statutory sick leave to small and medium-sized businesses.  That is a serious transfer of a problem.  It is a hospital pass in which the Government states that although it or the last Government created the problem of absenteeism it intends to give that problem to small and medium-sized businesses to solve.  The result of this, as any small businessman under pressure will tell us, is that these businesses will be forced to lay off members of their staff because they cannot afford to pay for this.  It is absolutely wrong that a small sector of society which is doing so much for the economy should be victimised in this way.  The cost to the State of such lay-offs will negate any benefit which the Minister for Social Protection sees being made in social welfare payments.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House there will be no transfer of this burden - a creation of the State - of the cost of sick leave to small businesses which are already so hard pressed and teetering on the brink?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I thank Deputy Ross for his courtesy in recognising the value of the renegotiation of that element of the agreement, namely, that 33% of the value accrued from the sale of State assets will be used for job creation purposes.  I also welcome his observation on the success, in particular of the IDA, in continuing to be a very strong authority for delivering foreign direct investment into the country.  The comments by President Clinton and a range of chief executives of major American businesses, and the interest shown by the Chinese Vice President in investment in Ireland are encouraging signs although we have a long way to go.I refer to the Deputy's question on sick leave.  What is needed is an efficient system that is equitable and fair.  This matter was raised before the budget.  The Government decided not to run with it for the simple reason that it is clearly focused on not putting barriers in the way of small and medium enterprises and small businesses being able to expand and employ people.  This problem is far more serious in the public sector than in the private sector because arrangements apply differently to small firms at private level than they do in the public service where, for a variety of reasons, several thousand people are out on sick leave every day.  For this reason the Minister for Social Protection has launched a discussion on this matter which will require a real conversation.  The Deputy may rest assured the Government's priority is to focus in the best way possible on having no obstacles or barriers to business and in having opportunities for small and medium enterprises to grow.  They are the life blood of the recovery of the economy.  From speaking to many small operators I understand their concerns about this.It is a case of a discussion initiated by the Minister for Social Protection taking place to have an efficient and equitable system that operates in the best interests of everybody.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I thank the Taoiseach.  The problem is absenteeism, which has been created by the State.  Smaller businesses cannot afford to take this burden.  The Taoiseach is as sympathetic as every other Member and he is aware that it is not just a matter of small businesses being crucified by the banks.  I am sure members of the Cabinet know there is a large build up of arrears because of small businesses not paying their rates.  Their failure to pay rates is not because they are involved in a boycott or a strike on them but because they cannot afford to pay them.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is a lot of money.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	88	This is not a militant group of people who are taking up the cudgels against the State or the Revenue.  They simply cannot afford to do this.  I suggest the conversation about them taking on this burden should end now because to suggest they can do so is unrealistic.  Some businesses could but they will lay off large numbers of their workforce or they will close down.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	89	They will be gone.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	90	In addition, if they have to pay for sick leave, they will have to pay for the substitutes for those out on sick leave.  I beg the Taoiseach to assure the House once again that, whatever conversation is going on in the Department of Social Protection, this proposal will be stillborn and small businesses will not be asked to bear that burden.  He should give them reassurance today that this measure will not be in the budget next December.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I am aware from speaking to a range of small and medium enterprise owners of the pressures they feel.  I met representatives of the banks yesterday evening and I had a constructive conversation about a number of areas ranging from plans to live up to their commitment for lending this year in parallel with the steps being taken by the Government in the jobs action programme and the alleviation of difficulties for business.  The meeting was very constructive.There is little absenteeism in the small and medium enterprise sector and persons who are ill are genuinely out sick.  The problem is that the entire bill for sick leave in the public sector comes back to the Department of Social Protection.  What is required is a pretty rational discussion about what is happening because this system needs to be managed more efficiently.  I am not sure if a real analysis has been done on the reasons several thousand people are out every day in the public sector.  When one compares the numbers with those for the SME sector, the rate of sickness is very much reduced.  The average number of working days lost in Ireland is higher than the European average because of this.  The Minister for Social Protection has started a realistic and rational discussion about how we can have a more efficient system which does not result in an enormous bill going back to her Department on an annual basis.I am conscious of the difficulties faced by business and that is why both in the budget and in the Finance Bill 2012 every effort has been made by Government to alleviate the difficulties faced by SMEs.  That is why we have proposed the microfinance scheme, the partial loan credit guarantee and other facilities they have been looking for to ease the pressure on them.  I am also conscious of the fact that local authorities, by and large, have made every effort to stabilise or reduce rates and individual managers, as they have always had, still have flexibility in looking at the account books of individual businesses that are suffering.  Let the discussion begin.  No decision was taken by Government on this matter.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	94	With regard to forthcoming legislation and to put the record straight, there was no mention of €2 billion or €5 billion for the sale of State assets in the original memorandum of understanding agreed with the troika.  That was something the Government decided to include in line with Fine Gael's policy, in particular, and it is wrong to continue to mislead people about this fact.  The Minister for Finance is on record articulating on a number of occasions in the House how the sale of State assets in terms of what is being proposed and revealed was introduced into the Government's memorandum of understanding with the troika.  Perhaps that is being done to appease Labour Party backbenchers and that is why Labour Party Ministers are deliberately misleading about this.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Will the Deputy get on with it please?

The valuations on those will be carried out by NewERA and the Government will make its decision following the presentation by the Minister.  I have mentioned that if a decision is made in respect of Coillte, it will relate to timber and not to land, and where Aer Lingus is concerned, it will be in respect of the shareholding.  From that point of view, Members can have a debate.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	152	That was one direct question for the Taoiseach.  Another direct question for him is how soon the taxi regulation legislation will be altered to allow for the use of new low cost hackney licences which are proposed to be issued?  I welcome this initiative as it was I who proposed it in this House a number of months ago.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Thank you, Deputy.  Is legislation promised on this?

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are discussing that matter.On the question of the taxi regulation report, that is under discussion and being handled by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  I am glad the Deputy welcomed that element of it.  I am sure it will be very beneficial in Kilgarvan and surrounding areas.  Down there near Robber's Glen the hackneys will be busy in the evening.  Obviously, the Deputy will have the opportunity to discuss that in the House when it progresses.

There are to be no other speeches.  There are other ways of raising these issues, by tabling a Topical Issue matter or a parliamentary question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	197	What about broken promises?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Deputies, you are not in Croke Park now.  Will they please show a bit of dignity in the House?
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoi na gealltanais go léir atá briste ag an Rialtas.  Tá a lán acu briste agus beimid ag cur na ceiste sin gach seachtain.  Under promised legislation, and this is a matter Deputy Ross tried to raise, there is a promise in the programme for Government to help small businesses.  He mentioned the rates review.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	216	He may have mentioned the rates.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Is there promised legislation on this?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	220	No, it is not a matter of "is there" but a matter of about what promised legislation the Deputy is inquiring.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Valuation Office was reviewing the rates because-----

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	223	On promised legislation - this arises from the neglect of the local authority housing sector by the previous Government - the housing Bill has been promised for some time.  It should have been dealt with by the people now in opposition, but it was not.  To what extent has progress been made in bringing the heads of the Bill to Government, and when can it be expected to come before the House?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Thank you.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Please hurry up, because there are other Deputies who wish to speak and there is a time limit.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I know.  The Opposition Members have taken up all the time.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I am trying to satisfy all the Deputies, so cut out the speeches and get on with the question.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The unfortunate Members on this side of the House have a view as well.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Plenty of leeway there.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I wish to ask about a Bill that has been needed for years, including during the time of the previous Administration.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Is that a speech?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I refer to the companies Bill, the aim of which is to update company law to ensure that we do not have breaches of company law that could result in serious liabilities for the Exchequer.  What progress has been made on this?  I know it is a detailed Bill with many sections.  Would it be possible to bring some parts of it to the House at an earlier stage to address the issues that have become apparent?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Deputy Durkan raised two questions.  The heads of the housing Bill are being worked on.  It is expected that it will come before the House some time this year.  The companies (miscellaneous provisions) Bill the Deputy mentioned is a consolidation Bill.  This is an enormous volume of work, with 1,300 sections.  I expect it will come before the House some time this year.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	235	With regard to the criteria for the establishment of technological universities, which were recently announced by the Higher Education Authority, when can we expect to see the heads of the Bill that will be required to give these criteria legal effect?  I am aware that this is a priority according to the programme for Government.  This is an important issue for the south east, which is the only region in the State that does not have a university.  It must be given priority by the Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The process is under way.  This is an important advance that the Government decided upon shortly after the demise of TalkTalk in Waterford.  There is a process that must be carried out to trigger the achievement of the criteria and to decide what groups of institutions will come together to achieve technological university status.  It is not a case of introducing legislation just now, but the process is clearly under way.  This will obviously be of advantage to the south east region, among others.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, issued a guidance document on surrogacy and citizenship yesterday evening.  This is a serious issue for a number of families.  In the document he promised legislation to deal with these matters.  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate when he expects that legislation to come before the House.  In the interim, I ask him to take a personal interest in the issues pertaining and examine whether passports can be issued to children whose DNA is unquestionably Irish.  The current situation is unacceptable, and I ask him to take a personal interest in it.

The clarification document issued yesterday by the Minister is beneficial in setting out the range of circumstances that apply in this enormously complex area.  Not just I but everybody else has an interest in ensuring that clarity and legal certainty is brought to this area.  The Minister commented on this earlier today.  He will take the opportunity when it is available to address the House on the matter.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, to delete lines 18 and 19.The net effect of the amendment is to remove section 1(2) from the Bill.  The Bill would therefore come into effect when it was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President.  I am trying to eliminate the element of retrospection back to 5 December.  We have the rather peculiar situation that the employment agency is the body that is obliged to pay the agency worker.  It is obliged to fulfil the terms of the new legislation.  However, the employment agency will not be in a position to know precisely what those terms are until this Bill has been passed into law.The Minister said on Committee Stage that the hirer has an obligation, but it is the employment agency that has the obligation.  In fact, the hirer has no legal obligation to inform the employment agency of the appropriate rate of pay for comparable workers currently employed by the hirer.  That is a serious gap in the Bill.It is not just a question of trying to assist employers in this case.  Admittedly, I have received representations from one or two employers who told me they are employing a number of agency workers and that there could be a very big bill in this case.  At least one of them told me they are contemplating a legal challenge.  If there is such a challenge to the legislation, the agency workers whom the directive and the legislation are designed to help might not get their benefits for a long time, perhaps years.  It depends on how far the legal process goes.The other point I made on Committee Stage is that the courts lean against retrospective legislation.  I quoted the authority on Committee Stage.  The test the courts usually apply to retrospective legislation is the one laid down by Chief Justice O'Higgins in the case of Hamilton v. Hamilton 1982.  He was quoted in the last case dealing with retrospective legislation before the Supreme Court, which was the nursing homes issue.  Chief Justice O’Higgins said: “Retrospective legislation, since it necessarily affects vested rights, has always been regarded as prima facie unjust.”  If it is prima facie unjust or if there is a presumption, as it were, against retrospective legislation, there must be very good reason for making legislation retrospective.To the best of my knowledge, although I am open to correction, this is the first time an EU directive in the labour law area has been made retrospective.  There have been a number of directives but this is the first that is retrospective.  I have learned from my inquiries that, despite the Government's great anxiety to have its operation in place as and from 5 December last, a number of EU countries have not yet, surprisingly, implemented this directive.  They include Denmark, Sweden, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece.  A number of countries have only partly transposed it, namely, the Netherlands and Belgium.I ask the Minister to re-examine the proposal I have put forward, which is to remove the element of retrospection from the legislation.  That retrospection will leave the legislation open to challenge and if it is challenged, it will delay the entitlements that should flow to workers as a result of the legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Deputy raised this on Committee Stage.  I have received advice from the Attorney General that this is the correct way to proceed, arising from our EU obligations which include that this be effective from 5 December.As the Deputy knows, there was considerable negotiation and hope that there would be a provision for a qualifying period before equal treatment would apply.  That did not prove possible.  To ensure that agencies and hirers were informed of their obligations we undertook very considerable communication with employer organisations and agencies.  The obligation comes under our EU obligations.  Already the Constitution recognises that obligations caused by our membership of the European Union have precedence, and the Constitution cannot invalidate Acts that are in accordance with our obligations under the Constitution.  On the basis of the legal advice I have received, this is the proper way to proceed.It is true that the agency has the obligation in the first instance.  If an agency worker complains of its failure, the matter will go to the rights commissioner and the rights commissioner will adjudicate.  There would be a separate issue of the agency recovering from the hirer if there was a failure of the hirer to co-operate properly with the agency.  That would be a matter for the civil law, with the agency taking an action to ensure recovery if there was inadequate co-operation.  This issue was well flagged and agencies were engaged in the consultative process.  Therefore, it did not come as a surprise.  There was a clear understanding on all sides that this obligation would take effect from 5 December.  There was, of course, hope its could be deferred under an element of the directive that allowed the social partners, acting exclusively on their own, without a specific role for the Government in making the decision, to seek a qualifying period.  In the event, that negotiation was not successful.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	292	As this issue was well ventilated on Committee Stage, I do not want to labour the point.The Minister cites an instance in which a hirer did not co-operate with an agency, leaving it with a liability.  The Bill makes it clear that the agency does not have a case against the hirer in such an instance.  Until the Bill becomes law the hirer is under no legal obligation to co-operate with the agency.   That is a non-argument.I take the Minister's point about a derogation.  Instead of trying to negotiate a derogation which he ultimately failed to do and waiting until the last minute to draft the Bill which has left us in the situation in which we find ourselves, the Department could have drafted the Bill several months ago, as the effect of the directive was well flagged.  A one line section could have been added to the Bill if a derogation had been granted.  That the Department was waiting for a derogation to be granted is no excuse for not drafting the Bill in time.The Minister harps on about our EU obligations.  Denmark, Sweden, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Belgium, countries that have a better record of social legislation than Ireland, have not yet implemented the directive.  What about their obligations?  Do we have more obligations than these EU member states?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Many other member states operate under a different system, with substantial collective agreements which de facto implement the directive.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	295	The arrangements in other countries are different.  These extensive collective agreements are specifically provided for in the directive.  I suspect that is why other member states are in a different position from us.  Ireland is implementing the directive.  We have an obligation under its terms to ensure agency workers are entitled to protection as and from 5 December last.  We have taken steps to make sure hirers and agencies are informed and aware of the obligation to co-operate in the implementation of the directive.  We are providing the legal vehicle for this to happen.  I am advised legally that this is the correct way for us to proceed.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	296	When introducing the Bill, the Minister said it represented an important step forward for agency workers by guaranteeing equal treatment in pay and basic working conditions with directly recruited workers.  I welcome the Government amendment which ensures the costs of training, safety equipment and so on will not be passed on to workers.I oppose amendment No. 1.  Sinn Féin's view is that equal rights and conditions should be afforded to workers as soon as possible.  If 5 December was the earliest date possible, we are in favour of it happening from that date.The Bill includes a provision to exclude permanent agency workers from its protection.  This undermines the spirit of the legislation and the words of the Minister.  This issue was discussed on Committee Stage and it was the hope of the select committee that the Government would act on that discussion.  This provision creates a loophole for employers to undermine the legislation.  It will lead to agency workers continuing to receive unequal pay and conditions and drive down the recruitment of permanent workers.The Government knows this is a loophole and refuses to act because it itself will benefit from it.  I, among others, tabled a number of amendments to this provision which were ruled out of order because they would have placed a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Will the Minister tell us how many permanent agency workers are employed in the public service and what is the cost to the public purse?  Maintaining this loophole is a cynical act by the Government as it seeks to undermine workers' rights and drive down the wages of the low paid.  The same driving down of wages approach is not found in the Civil Service or among Ministers.I am shocked that Labour Party Deputies acquiesced on this important point.  Where were they when this loophole was found?

In page 5, line 26, after "agency" to insert the following:", but the following shall not be deemed to be agency workers—(a) employees of contractor companies; and(b) limited liability companies where the worker is also the beneficial owner of the company”.As I said on Committee Stage, I do not have strong feelings about this amendment.  I will not lie awake tonight tossing and turning about whether employees of contractor companies are designated agency workers.  During the debate on Committee Stage I asked the Minister if it was intended to include these categories of employees as agency workers.  He told me he had been advised that they were not agency workers under the terms of the Bill.  I have made some inquiries in the meantime with legal people who say there is a doubt about the matter.  They have explained ways and means - I will not go into them now - by which the Bill could be interpreted as including these categories.  If it is the Minister's intention that they will not be covered by the Bill, as he indicated on Committee Stage, it might be safer to explicitly say this.

In addition, my Department will issue guidelines; therefore, there will be absolute clarity for everyone concerned.

However, I will not press the amendment.  With due respect to the Minister, what he says in this House will be irrelevant in any court proceedings.  I understand the guidelines will also be irrelevant in court proceedings.  However, if that is the advice the Minister has received, I accept it.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 5, to delete lines 27 to 30 and in page 6, to delete lines 1 to 11 and substitute the following:" "basic working and employment conditions" means terms and conditions of employment required to be included in a contract of employment by virtue of any enactment or collective agreement, or any arrangement that applies generally in respect of employees, or any class of employees, of a hirer, and that relate to—(a) pay,(b) working time,(c) rest periods,(d) rest breaks during the working day,(e) night work,(f) annual leave, or(g) public holidays;”.Amendment No. 3, to the definition of what constitutes basic working and employment conditions, expands the definition by including a reference to the fact that these terms arise under contracts of employment deriving under any enactment, collective agreement or other arrangement that applies generally to employees, or any class of employees, of a hirer.  An amendment I proposed, and that was accepted, on Committee Stage inadvertently dropped the important words that it applies generally to employees, or any class of employees, of a hirer.  This qualification needs to be reinserted into the definition to ensure there is clarity around the fact that the terms that apply generally in respect of employees under any enactment or collective agreement, or that are generally applicable, apply also to temporary agency workers.  That principle in these areas, if it is provided for in an agreement, must also be applied to the agency workers.Amendment No. 8 does not propose any substantive amendment to the definition of the constituent elements of pay that are already included in the Bill.  Rather, it is linked to amendment No. 3 in that it proposes to move, from the definition section of basic working and employment conditions to a more logical position under the definition of pay, the items that are specifically referenced in the second paragraph of Article 5.4 of the directive which includes sick pay and pension arrangements.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	307	Amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 10 are in some ways a repeat of the discussion that we had at Committee Stage and relate to the issue of equality on enhanced conditions of work and payment beyond the basics.  I appreciate that the Minister has added on a few areas above the basics, but the United Left Alliance believes that is not enough and if we are talking about equality, then we should be talking about equality in all employment issues.At Committee Stage, some of our amendments were ruled out of order on the basis that they would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  At the time, we asked the Minister to take cognisance of that fact and then not have a situation where we were forced to put down amendments that solely dealt with the private sector because of his unwillingness to deal with equality for agency workers who may potentially be employed by the State at a later date.  Given that the Minister has not accommodated this, our amendments, in order to be valid and to go on the floor of the House, had to relate to non-Exchequer funded posts.  It makes a mockery of the notion of equality if we are saying we, as Opposition Deputies, only have the right to put forward this provision in the case of the private sector because of the Minister's unwillingness to do so for any potential public sector employee.The amendments speak for themselves.  We are talking about holiday entitlements beyond the basic statutory minimum, holiday rostering, adoptive and parental leave, and other payments relating to access to pensions etc.  Obviously, we are aware that some of these issues are not straightforward, but they are perfectly capable of being dealt with.  When industries where staff have multi-employers have the ability to provide a pension scheme etc., agency workers should similarly have the right to access such schemes.  Our amendments involve such payments, such pension provisions, work-related travel and expenses, and other allowances that would be available to comparator employees.It gets to the heart of the issue.  We are talking about protection of temporary agency workers and equality across the board and equality should mean equality in other social protection and payments above the norm.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	308	My amendment No. 9 was ruled out for the same reason and I defer to the wisdom of the Ceann Comhairle on that issue.  To make the point, the Bill is deficient in that it does not take account of allowances to which agencies workers should be entitled on the same basis as permanent employees.  In the public health sector, for example, allowances are paid to nurses who achieve additional qualifications in areas such as intensive care, theatre, accident and emergency etc.  It seems quite rational, if the purpose of the Bill is to secure equity right across the board between workers who are employed via an agency and workers who are permanent employees, that allowances of this type should be taken on board.If it is the case that amendments of this nature may not pass today, I wonder would the Minister consider an amendment to the Bill and take on board the comments that are being made by, for example, many in the trade union movement who want equity in this area.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	309	It seems as if we are paying lip-service to the idea of equal treatment for agency workers but trying to exclude certain allowances and certain payments.I accept fully the Ceann Comhairle's decision to rule amendment No. 18 out of order, but it is for the same reason that we, as Deputy Clare Daly indicated, had to refer specifically to the private sector because if we sought equality for all temporary agency employees, that would also be considered to be a charge on the Exchequer and would have been similarly ruled out of order because of the Minister's failure to deal with that issue of equality.It seems to amount to the Government wanting the right to have a second tier of workers which it can exploit and not give the same rights and allowances to as ones that would be directly employed.  There can be no other explanation for the Minister's refusal to deal with the issue of extending full equality to temporary agency workers in terms of all the rights, allowances and provisions that would be made for comparators who are directly employed.I suppose that merely indicates that the point of agency workers is to undermine the pay and conditions of directly employed workers.  It seems, in refusing to give equality in these area, the Minister is going along with that even while paying lip-service to the idea of giving equal rights to agency workers.  It is disappointing that the Minister is doing that.I strongly ask him to reconsider, although I doubt at this stage he will do so.  It is simply not right or fair that agency workers should be given lesser rights when it comes to matters such as sick pay, pension entitlements and other arrangements that directly employed people have.Similarly, although it is ruled out of order, the issue of persons who are permanently employed by the agencies being allowed to be paid as much as 50% less than those employed directly is outrageous and is a recipe to undermine the purpose of this legislation which is to give equality to agency workers.  It is very disappointing.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I thank the Members for those various contributions.To start with the last comment first, the purpose of this legislation is to deal with temporary agency workers who have been clearly exploited where they have been brought in and paid at an entirely different rate.  Basic pay and conditions is the issue.  This is not seeking to state that short-term assignments are identical to the employment status achieved by persons who are full-time workers.  On full-time workers who become part of a pension scheme, that is not a basic pay and terms of employment condition that is required to be applied equally under the directive.It was designed to deal with people who are being exploited.  We have made sure we are protecting people's basic terms and conditions.Some of the issues that have been raised in the amendment in the name of Deputy Clare Daly and others are included.  Holiday entitlements that are within collective agreements and arrangements that apply generally to employees or a class of employees would need to be equally applied.  Therefore, the holiday entitlements that prevail would transpose to the temporary agency workers, and bank holidays and employment registration orders would be included in the terms of amendment No. 4.The question of adoptive and parental leave is a separate issue as these are matters that arise under equality legislation.  We are not seeking to replicate in this legislation what is dealt with in equality legislation, hence we are not introducing a new legal basis for rights in regard to adoptive and parental leave, which are already dealt with in other legislation.Amendment No. 6 seeks to require the inclusion of sick pay and pension schemes.  I cannot accept this because it goes well beyond the scope of the directive's requirements.  The directive is about guaranteeing a floor of basic working and employment conditions that would apply to temporary agency workers.  Nonetheless, it still recognises that people on short-term assignments are not in the same position as those who are full-time employees.  Entitlements to pension rights or to various bonus schemes, share options and so on do not automatically transfer an entitlement under the directive, nor do we seek to go beyond the spirit and intent of the directive to introduce such obligations, which would have very considerable financial implications at a time when there is serious pressure on employers and employment.  We are seeking to ensure people are not exploited.  We are not seeking to define short-term assignments as equivalent to different types of arrangements.With regard to amendment No. 10, some of the areas referred to are included, such as overtime premia and bank holiday premia, as well as work-related allowances such as shift work, piece work and unsocial hours allowances, and some others are also included if they come within the scope of collective agreements or arrangements that apply generally to employees or to any class of employees.  However, some areas are not included.  For example, where there is a dispute, a worker can contest and the issue will go to a rights commissioner for determination.  We are seeking to protect agency workers in areas where we know there has been huge abuse of basic pay and conditions and we want to make sure this does not happen.A number of Deputies, including Deputy Nulty, raised concerns about the derogation provided for in the directive, the so-called Swedish derogation.  For example, arrangements are suggested which would mean workers on assignment are paid at least 50% of pay during periods when they are not on assignment, as is provided for in the legislation.  Where such arrangements are in place, this would give rise to a situation where the full force of the directive would not apply.  Such systems are not in any widespread use in Ireland and we have sought to ensure that there would be protection in respect of cases where such a derogation may be taken up.  That protection includes the requirement for written notices, including the example I gave of 50% pay to be paid when the person is not in employment.Following the discussion on Committee Stage, we examined whether there was additional protection or provisions that could ensure this system would not be abused.  Items discussed included requiring that people could not arbitrarily terminate employment and that there would be an obligation to pay for a certain period if there was arbitrary termination.  When we looked into that, we were advised that it would actually make the provision more frail in regard to protecting people.  If there was an arbitrary lump sum, we would almost invite employers to decide to use this as a short-term arrangement, with workers getting temporary assignments and a retention payment for the off-time.  This would almost build into what we initially thought would be a protection an incentive to regard this as something to be used in a system that would be very advantageous to the employer, not to the employee.  Therefore, we have not made any additional changes.  There is a written requirement so people enter into such a contract knowing they are giving up certain rights they would otherwise have as temporary agency workers, if they agree to such arrangements.This is included for the reason that it provides flexibility and is a derogation that is provided for in the directive.  If we do not make provision for it now, it can never be considered in the future.  However, it is not an area where we have any evidence of abuse.  We have transposed it into the legislation but we believe we have done this in such a way that the interests of workers will be protected by it.  Obviously, this is an area where there is not a great deal of experience in Ireland of applying the rules.  We feel we have done the best we can.  We went back after the Committee Stage discussion to ascertain whether there were other changes we could make to make it more robust.  The advice we received from the draftsman was that what we were doing was the best way to handle it.  Let it then be challenged before a rights commissioner if there are abuses.  The legal provision is fairly clear-cut and would give better protection to people to challenge any use of this provision that was not seen to be fair and reasonable by the workers concerned.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	311	It would appear that improvements are being made in this area.  However, I am not sure just how good the rights a worker working for an agency will have.  As building contractors, we used to sometimes employ agency workers, for a number of reasons.  We generally kept our own direct employees but, if we were under pressure and needed them, we hired agency workers.  They were paid at a rate which was perhaps a couple of euro above the official rate but there was still a saving because we were not involved in their pensions, holiday pay and so on.  The big advantage for the building contractor employing the agency worker is that the contractor can specify, for example, that he wants the worker from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. on Monday, does not want him on Tuesday or Wednesday, but would like him back again on Thursday at 8 a.m. to work for ten hours and would also like him to work eight hours on Friday.  This was very attractive to a contractor because, as one can imagine, there might not be full-time work for a person on a site.The sad part was that, more often than not, these workers who came on-site were generally getting less per hour than our own workers.  Friction and dissatisfaction would sometimes develop because the agency worker was not being treated as well as the person who was directly employed.  Agencies were able to charge a premium for their services because they could state to an employer that a worker could be taken on on a Monday but there was no requirement to keep him or her on the Tuesday.  Will agencies still be able to tell workers that there is no work for them on a Tuesday but they can come back in on the Thursday, or will they be obliged to take care of employees for a full working week?  Many are engaged by agencies for six to 12 months but are not always guaranteed a full working week.  They might get one day's work or they might get five, there is no guarantee.  That is not a very good framework within which to work.  I have noticed that very few agency workers are married.  Family life would not be sustainable within the structure being offered to them by the agencies.  I am curious to know whether agencies will be allowed to lay people off as they please or whether they will be obliged to look after them for a full working week.On the construction sector in general, it serves everybody better, including the client who is seeking to have a job done, if a company has its own direct employees.  I argue that there has been a serious drop in the quality of workmanship in the past 20 years in the construction industry and that the overuse of agency workers and agency companies by contractors has contributed to this.  In the past contractors were much more likely to have their own employees - workers they trained themselves - and they were much more au fait with what needed to be done.  That was a far better arrangement.  However, we should get an agency worker of higher quality if we give such workers the same rights as regular employees.  The closer we can get to this, the better for everybody.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I accept that the Minister has taken on board some of the points we have made.  However, the issue in regard to pension schemes, as set out in section 6, must be dealt with.  Otherwise there will remain a serious inequality, whereby agency workers will not have the same arrangements as full-time employees.  Will the Minister review this matter?  A person's entitlements on retirement is an important aspect of his or her long-term role in the workplace.  If this matter is not dealt with as it affects agency workers, they will remain very vulnerable.I reiterate our disappointment at the provisions relating to the so-called Swedish derogation.  The Minister has said he has not taken the line we propose because it has not been an issue.  Surely we should be taking legislative action to prevent employers from abusing the requirement in regard to the figure of 50% of pay.  This should be included in the Bill rather than being left open to challenge in the future.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The entire rationale behind the use of agency workers has been to casualise employment, with such workers subject to various employment abuses.  We have been slow enough in bringing the Bill forward and it comes on foot of an EU directive.  Rather than being minimalist in its provisions, we have an opportunity to ensure agency workers will be treated properly and equally with the employees they work beside on a daily basis.  Amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 10 seek to meet this objective.  The legislation should ensure agency workers will be employed on the same basis as full-time employees.  Sick pay, pensions, holiday entitlements, top-up maternity payments, work-related allowances and so on should be encompassed within it.  What has been happening in the State and throughout the Europeand Union is that because agency workers effectively have few or no rights, their own positions have become vulnerable and they, in turn, have been used to undermine the position of full-time employees and move towards a model of employment that is casual and part-time.  The opportunity should be taken in the Bill to act as comprehensively as possible in affording the same level of protection to agency workers as to full-time employees.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Deputy Mick Wallace who has practical experience in this area has made the point that the nature of temporary agency work is often intermittent and serves to meet the need to fulfil additional work obligations as they arise.  That flexibility is needed in many workplaces and the reason temporary agency work arrangements have developed.  Such arrangements suit certain workers who are not seeking a full week's work.In regard to the Swedish derogation, we are providing that agency workers must be paid the same basic rate.  The Deputy has mentioned that there has been friction on some sites as a consequence of different rates being paid to different workers.  That will no longer apply under these provisions.  The only situation in which a company could seek not to apply the same basic rate is where it makes a commitment that during the down time, when workers are not employed, they will be paid at least 50% of the basic rate.  That will only be allowable where the agency has informed the workers concerned that they are entering into an arrangement where some elements of the package will not apply to them but that on the days they are not working they will be paid a retainer.That is the exemption the directive allows in order to facilitate people who want to enter into that type of contract.  They undertake to be available at short notice but will have the confidence that on the days they are not asked to work they will be paid something.  The directive anticipated that this would be a possible arrangement into which people would willingly and knowingly enter and a flexibility that would be required.  We are transposing it into Irish law, with the proviso that people be formally notified, by way of a written notice, that they are giving up something to which they would otherwise be entitled by entering such an arrangement.  They will only agree to this where it suits their own circumstances and requirements.Deputies Joan Collins and Seamus Healy have raised the broader question of why we are not insisting on pension rights being afforded to agency workers.  I have responded to this point.  The purpose of the legislation is not to introduce new provisions generally to Irish employment law.  There is no obligation on an employer to provide a pension.  The only obligation now on an employer is to ensure that a worker has access to a PRSA into which the employer has no obligation to contribute.  We cannot under this provision introduce new far-reaching provisions in Irish labour law.  Pension and sick pay are not included because this was designed to protect people from abuse in respect of basic pay and employment conditions.  It does not seek to assert that arrangements in place in respect of an employee who has been working with an employer for years, such as sick pay, share options, pension provisions and so on would apply to a person on a short term assignment.  That is not the intention of the directive and is not what we are seeking to transpose into Irish law.We are not seeking to include new entitlements in this area, rather we are seeking to protect against abuses that are known to occur.  The purpose of the directive is to protect people from abuses.  While I can understand the Deputies' desire to see better working conditions, what we are doing is setting minimum protection that will apply.  Issues such as longer term pension provisions and whether we should have compulsory pensions and so on are for another day.  We are not seeking to introduce them in this legislation.

In page 8, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:"(3) If any agency worker believes that an incorrect comparator has been used that worker must inform the employer and the employer will be obliged toinvestigate the claim and if necessary correct the situation within a period of fourteen days. If the employer corrects the situation within fourteen days, then no claim will lie against the employer.".The purpose of this amendment is improve procedure and make the Bill more workable from the view of the employer and employee.  Where an agency worker takes up a position and is paid in comparison with a comparator that turns out to be incorrect he or she can take a case to the rights commissioner and, if necessary, go further up the line.  I propose a type of fast-track system to save the time of the rights commissioner, who is already pretty well over-burdened, and of the worker and potential defendant, namely, the employment agency.  The amendment provides that if a worker believes the hirer has for one reason or another used an incorrect comparator he or she can inform the agency of that, following which the agency will investigate the matter with the hirer and try to have it rectified.  I anticipate that if the Minister is prepared to accept this amendment this will result in many cases being resolved without the necessity to go to the rights commissioner and so on, which only puts further pressure on already strained resources and puts the agency worker and potential defendant to unnecessary trouble.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	321	This matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  This is a positive suggestion which would improve the legislation.  It must be seen against the backdrop of a 76 week waiting lists for a rights commissioner hearing and a system that is grinding to a standstill.  Anything that assists in avoiding a further burden on that situation should be welcomed.  It would be unworkable to suggest that a casual employee would have to wait 76 weeks to have his or her case heard, by which time the case would be only a long distance memory.  This measure would not cost anything and would reduce the burden on the State's industrial relations machinery.  I do not see any reason the Minister could not accept this amendment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I understand the desire of Deputies in supporting this amendment.  However, putting into a Bill of this nature such a provision implies there is in place a sanction for an employer who fails to address a matter but no such sanction is implied or provided for.  What the Deputies seek to introduce is a regulatory obligation which would have no oversight mechanism.  I will ensure that the guidelines issued to employers includes this as good practice.  We should not provide in primary legislation that this would be a statutory obligation when we are not providing for an enforcement mechanism for such a provision. I do not believe there should be an enforcement mechanism for such a provision.We have made good progress reorganising employment rights and industrial relations agencies.  A pilot conciliation scheme, which provides that queries received from temporary agency workers be forwarded immediately to a conciliation arrangement, will be introduced during the first half of this year.  Under this scheme the employer will be made aware of the situation and his or her obligations in that regard.  Obviously, if the employer refuses to address the matter it will then proceed to a hearing.  However, the Government is moving to introduce arrangements whereby such queries that clearly ought to be resolved through simple conciliation and clarification of the position would not on their arrival enter a lengthy queue to wait for a hearing.  The Government is attempting to stream away all such cases and to reduce the number of cases that sometimes go to highly legalistic tribunals that serve the interests of neither the workers nor the employers.  Consequently, rather than including this proposal as an item of primary legislation that is set out in the law in the manner suggested by Deputy O'Dea, I instead seek to enshrine it within the implementation guidelines that will be issued.  In addition, the entire thrust of the reform I am attempting to introduce is to streamline the employment rights bodies.  It will be piloted, hopefully will be successful and then will be mainstreamed quickly, thereby streaming away challenges of this nature in which the facts of the case are pretty clear, thus avoiding the type of clogging to which Deputy Clare Daly rightly refers.

It appears to me to be typical Civil Service-speak, in that he cannot accept this because there is no sanction and no oversight.  However, no one is worried about sanction or oversight.  Were an incorrect comparator to be used, the sanction would kick in down the line when someone took a case after a lengthy wait for the rights commissioner.  I am trying to avoid a scenario in which someone would be obliged to approach that overburdened and understaffed authority and in which the sanction can be avoided.  I refer to a scenario in which the employee will not be obliged to go to the trouble of approaching that body and the sanction for the employer would be avoided because the mistake would be pointed out to the latter, who will be given 14 days in which to correct it.  As this will work in many cases, I cannot discern the logic of the Minister's response when he states there is neither sanction nor oversight.  The entire idea is to avoid a sanction down the road and the consequential overuse of the already heavily burdened rights commissioner or the State's industrial relations machinery.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	325	This is what I believe any proper employer would do.  However, there is no sense in stating that were an employer to correct the situation and deal with the issue on the 15th or 16th day, such an employer still would be in some sort of breach.  The Government does not intend to introduce a form of sanction regime for a new provision that really comprises the substance of a guideline to good practice on the manner in which an employer should deal with a worker in this situation.  However, if one introduces a provision in primary legislation, one is inferring that a failure to comply with it is a matter that can in some way be litigated or pursued with the rights commissioner.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Not necessarily.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	327	That is not the point.  The Government seeks to achieve good practice and to get in place a compliance culture among employers, not to introduce an obligation that sets out in primary legislation time limits and time lines in a highly precise way that could lead to unexpected and unnecessary outcomes, while still ensuring that there is a robust system in which a worker who has not got a fair deal has the absolute right to go to the rights commissioner.  There will be in place a service that will stream away such a case if it clearly is a matter of clarifying the facts.  There will be a quick move to contact the employer to outline the facts as presented, to note that the matter appears to be straightforward and to query the reason the employer is not dealing with it.  Consequently, putting this proposal into primary legislation effectively is a form of coat-trailing and will not really have any effect unless Members introduce or anticipate that employers can be challenged for failing to do this and that on the 15th day, such employers have in some way failed and a provision can then be triggered to pursue them.This is not the way in which to proceed in such a case.  The Government's intention is to avoid contention of this nature, whereby someone who took action on the 15th day should have done so on the 14th day and the matter then goes before the rights commissioner as another case to be investigated.  This is not the approach, as I am trying to get reasonableness and to build up a compliance culture among employers.  That is the purpose of the reform the Government seeks to introduce in the employment rights area.  It is not to set highly rigid rules and regulations but to get a general compliance culture and a system that supports such a culture for employers and workers, as well as a flexible employment rights and industrial relations approach in which there is compliance first, conciliation next and hearings of disputes only in extremely difficult and intractable cases.  This is the approach and while I accept the spirit in which this amendment is being offered, I cannot accept it as an item of primary legislation.  However, I will ensure the guidelines my Department sets out and the practices it seeks to promote will be sympathetic to what the Deputies are trying to achieve.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I move amendment No. 15:
In page 9, line 6, after "same" to insert the following:"or where different, in the aggregate not less favourable than,".As for amendment No. 15, the basic point is that under the European Union directive, an agency worker must be put on the same level, in so far as possible, as a permanent employee.  I simply am using a formula that has been used in other labour legislation to the effect that rather than stating that they will receive exactly the same rights, it states they will get benefits, rights or whatever that are "in the aggregate not less favourable than".  While I understand the Minister may have some technical difficulty with this proposal, as he pointed out on Committee Stage, I seek clarification on it.In respect of amendment No.16, the Minister has provided in the legislation that if an agency worker is taken on to do the same job as a permanent worker already employed, the employer is entitled not to pay the agency worker the same rate if knowledge, skill, length of service and so on are relevant factors.  For example, someone who has been doing the same job for ten years may have built up a level of expertise that someone coming in naturally would not have on his or her first day and the legislation provides for this case.  However, I refer to another scenario, whereby an employer can have some employees who were employed on a particular pay scale from a time when conditions in the country were much better.  The same employer may, over the last 12 months or so when matters were very different, have taken on further employees to perform precisely the same work.  However, the employer may have considered it necessary to employ them on a different pay scale.  In such a scenario, it is not a case of experience, length of service and so on, but is a question of when the people were taken on.  There are a number of instances in which people who were taken on since the recession kicked in are on a lesser pay scale, even though they are doing the same work as others who were taken on during better times.I refer to a scenario in which such an employer decides to take on an agency worker to do the same type of work.  The firm already has employees doing the work the agency worker will do but who are on two different wage scales.  I asked the Minister on Committee Stage at which wage scale must such an agency worker be taken on and he replied it would be the newer, lower wage scale.  I then asked who would choose and whether it would be the employer, the hirer or the agency worker.  I believe the Minister told me the hirer had the choice as to which category of employee with which to compare the agency worker.  However, there is some doubt about who can choose in this case.  If the legislation means what the Minister told me on Committee Stage it means, it is as well to write it in specifically.  That is the purpose of amendment No.16, the amendment in which I am most interested.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Deputy raised these issues on Committee Stage.  We had a discussion about and reflected on them.  The first amendment concerns cases in which the overall package is good but some individual terms are not as good.  The directive is clear in this regard.  It does not allow us latitude to take an aggregate package.  Essentially, the view is that if such arrangements were permissible, they would be manipulated.  There could be a lower basic rate in the expectation that a person would be offered overtime which might then not materialise and the person concerned would be left on the lower basic rate.  The fear is that this arrangement would be manipulated and the directive does not give us latitude to weigh one against the other.  The basic rights are spelled out.  This is about basic minimum rights which have to be observed.On the second issue the Deputy seeks to go beyond what is permitted by the directive, the wording of which requires that equal treatment be afforded as if the agency worker was directly employed.  Therefore, the words "be entitled" which the Deputy is seeking to have deleted are appropriate.  The amendment would introduce additional conditionality that the directive does not allow; therefore, it is not legally possible to agree to it, as it would potentially bring us into conflict with the European Commission for incorrect transposition.The Deputy cites the example of an employer who employed workers two or three years ago at higher rates but now the going rate is lower and he or she is seeking to employ agency workers at the lower rate.  The crucial issue is whether a worker was directly employed on the day he or she was taken on, or on 5 December, from which the measure has effect.  The hirer will decide, but it will be open to challenge by the worker on the grounds that the employer is arbitrarily choosing a rate that is much lower than the rate for all other employees.  The employer will then have to make the case that as and from 5 December the rate to be applied to the job was the one offered, even though there might be workers on the higher rate applied two years before.  The onus is on the hirer to show that he or she can back up the choice made.  If he or she is directly employing employees on that day, he or she has a clear comparator.  He or she might be able to claim that he or she has taken on one full-time employee and three agency workers on the same basic rate; in that instance he or she will have a cast iron case.  If is only where he or she takes on agency workers and the only comparable employees are on much higher rates, that he or she will have to produce evidence to back up the choice made.  It is important that this onus rest on the hirer and that we do not allow an arbitrary situation where he or she could claim that the rate has been manufactured out of the air.  The hirer makes the decision; he or she decides the going rate for a direct employee.  That is the rate for the agency worker.  If this is challenged by the agency worker, the employer will have to back up the choice made.  I can see what the Deputy is saying because undoubtedly rates have come down in many instances, but this is designed to protect the employee and make sure there is a proper basis for the rate.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I accept that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled amendment No.18 out of order.  While we cannot move it, it is important that we record our deep concerns, shared by trade unions, about this section of the Bill.  We referred briefly to it earlier, but the provision which allows agencies to employ people on a permanent contract and only pay them 50% of what they were paid on their last assignment means that they can permanently have a group of employees for whom the central thrust of the Bill simply does not apply.  In that context, it completely undermines the Bill.  If I represented an employment agency, I would see this as a way around almost all the provisions of the Bill.The Minister has said agencies employing workers on a permanent basis is not a widespread phenomenon in Ireland.  However, what is to stop them from doing so now?  The Bill improves things for agency workers to a degree, although not as far we would like.  I accept that the Minister has taken on board some of the points made on Committee Stage, but this opt-out of the central provision of the Bill essentially allows agencies a way around equality and all the provisions of the Bill.  They can establish a permanent group of employees who will be paid less, no matter for whom they are working and to whom the provisions of the Bill simply will not apply.  It is not, as the Minister seems to be suggesting, just when they are not working.  The point is that the central equality provision of the Bill does not apply to them if they are employed permanently by the agency.  The only requirement is that they must, during the periods they are not working, receive 50% of what they received on their last assignment.  What they received on their last assignment might have been substantially lower than what a directly employed worker was paid for doing the same job.This is a recipe for a coterie of workers to work alongside others paid twice what they are paid, or God knows what.  It is a complete opt-out clause in respect of the equality provision included in the Bill.  If we do not grasp this, the agencies will.  We will have a new mechanism that will allow them to circumvent the Bill and create a second-tier workforce.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I am also disappointed that amendment No.19 has been ruled out of order.  There is much in the Bill that I support but section 7 is deplorably inadequate.  The Bill fails to provide for effective anti-avoidance measures.  Article 5.5 of the directive places a clear duty on the Government to introduce appropriate measures to prevent abuse of the derogation.  However, under the Bill, as it stands, it will be all too easy for employers or agencies to use the Swedish derogation to circumvent equal pay rights.Legislation needs to be amended to provide for safeguards against abuse, including a guaranteed rate of pay, a guaranteed minimum number of hours, a guaranteed period in the last assignment or an averaging of the hours worked during a particular period.While I am not in a position to move amendment No. 19, which was ruled out of order, the Minister could amend the legislation either today or at some future date.  Amendment No. 19 did not emerge out of thin air.  It is influenced by the regulations that have been put in place in Britain to prevent the type of exploitation to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  Britain has a flexible labour market which is similar to ours.  However, it has put in place protections which are similar to those contained in amendment No. 19.  There is no reason we could not introduce such protections.  Disingenuous comparisons are often made between pay rates here and in Britain.  These comparisons are usually out of context and incorrect.  In the context of agency workers, the British authorities are a step ahead.  Will the Minister reflect on amendment No. 19, which I cannot move, and consider amending the legislation?  The amendment contains quite a detailed proposal which would strengthen regulation in this area and protect agency workers.

Some of the amendments we tabled in respect of this matter have been ruled out of order.  There is no doubt that the Bill creates a loophole and that this will grow in the future.  If the Government is seeking a growth area, then it has found one because the loophole will give a competitive advantage to businesses which use the workers to which it relates.  The existence of this advantage will incentivise the use of the loophole to which I refer in the future.  The loophole has the effect of undermining all the other works for which the legislation makes provision.  How many people are employed by the State under conditions such as those outlined in the section?  What is the cost to the State of paying their wages?  I am just trying to obtain an understanding of why this loophole is so attractive to the Government.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The Minister would be surprised by the number of people who remain on a full-time basis with agencies.  I assure him that during a building boom a few years ago, most of the large building firms in this city had many more agency workers than direct employees on their books.  This was because it had become somewhat more attractive to employ the former.  I have not seen the figures - I would love to do so - but I am of the view that large numbers of people are employed by agencies on a full-time basis.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	336	We are getting to the nub of the issue.  There is a gaping chasm in the Minister's argument to the effect that the relevant issues are being addressed in the legislation.  This is a substantial loophole.  It is the case that agencies have quite large numbers of staff.  A great many questions are asked with regard to how - in comparison with Aer Lingus and its large workforce - Ryanair can do so much with so few workers.  The reason is that companies such as Ryanair maintain hardly any staff as direct employees and that they instead rely on agencies and agency workers.  The agencies to which I refer charge massive sums in respect of training, etc.  As a result of the fact that the derogation will remain in place, there is nothing in the legislation which will prevent the current position from continuing to obtain.  We are paying lip service to both the directive and the concept of equality.  In addition, we are giving a nod and a wink to rogue employers in respect of the gaping hole into which they can jump to avoid ensuring equality and addressing the very issues which the legislation was designed to deal with in the first instance.  The large numbers of people who are carried, so to speak, by agencies would vindicate my words in this regard.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	340	A number of issues were raised in respect of the Swedish model.  That model is not prevalent in Ireland.  It is not the case that people in the public service are paid retainers for periods during which they are not working.  It is obviously an arrangement which can be suitable for both sides.  Deputy Wallace described the way in which people were employed in the construction sector in recent times, namely, where they could be working for a couple of days, then be off and then be back in employment again.  In such circumstances, being paid a retainer in respect of the periods during which one is not working can be attractive.  We are seeking to have in place an arrangement which can be used if it suits both sides.  Flexibility exists in this regard.  It is not the intention that this arrangement would allow people to bypass the provisions of the legislation.  If it were abused in that way, we would certainly revisit the issue.  Essentially, this is not a system which is in place.  However, we recognise that it could be used but not abused.  It is provided for under the directive and there are cases where it is used in other countries, but not in a way whereby it is capable of being abused.  We are including the derogation now because we would not be able to do so later.The protections in respect of this matter are stronger than the Deputies have indicated.  The commitment must be to permanent employment.  In other words, a person must be taken on by an agency as a permanent employee.  If this is done in a bogus fashion, if it is used as a way to try to bypass paying agency workers who are taken on for short-term assignments by pretending that they are long-term employees and if a challenge arises, then agency workers will have the right to make retrospective claims in respect of the entire periods during which employers failed to apply the terms of the agency work directive.  If employers seek to abuse this aspect of the legislation and, as Deputies fear, use it for short-term gain, there is a strong case in respect of their being challenged.  As already stated, agency workers would also be in a position to seek equal treatment on a retrospective basis right back to the day on which they were first employed.There is a balance on both sides.  For example, a balance will apply when the arrangement is put in place and we will be seeking that clear, written statements will be provided to agency workers which will indicate the conditions which will apply to them, that these will be different from those outlined in the law, as it applies, and that they will they will be paid the rate which applies under the REA or the 50% rate which applies in respect of downtime periods.  There is another protection in place in respect of cases where agencies might use this mechanism as a short-term way of abusing the terms of the arrangement.  In such circumstances, a claim can be made and the whole construct created by an employer in respect of pretending that some form of long-term commitment exists would fall.  We are of the view that a balance has been struck.  This is not an area of which we have experience because there is not a wide range of contracts of this nature of which we are aware.Information is not available with regard to the percentage of people who are classed as permanent agency workers.  It is certainly the case that some individuals are taken on as temporary agency workers and that they later enter permanent arrangements with those who hired them.  However, we do not have data of the type sought by Deputy O'Dea.We are trying to strike a balance in respect of providing what could be a reasonable and flexible working arrangement for some people.  We are also seeking to ensure there will be adequate protection available and that in downtime periods, people will be paid at least 50% of their normal remuneration.  Furthermore, the Bill stipulates that a permanent contract of employment must be provided in order that these workers will know they are being offered permanent positions.If the agency does not deliver, there is a right of redress.I can see people may be concerned about how a process could be abused but we have provided protections and we will certainly monitor it.  If there is a sense that abuses are creeping in which undermine the value of the provision, we will revisit it.  We have designed a scheme which is reasonable and robust in defending against abuse but which leaves open a system which may suit both sides.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I must confess Deputy Wallace has far more practical experience of the construction industry than I do.  If one looks at the situation in the country at present, the percentage of agency workers who fall into the category of permanent agency workers is minuscule.  The Minister should have dropped the Swedish derogation from the Bill.  Every action he has taken since the issue was first raised demonstrates that he should have dropped it.  He stated he thought it would create a particular loophole so he moved to close it.  The real problem is that after we pass the Bill today and it goes through the Seanad next week, what will happen when the next loophole emerges or is found?  Will we suspend proceedings in both Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with yet another loophole found in the legislation by the clever legal representatives of employment agencies?The Minister states the directive provides for it.  However, the directive allows any individual country to exclude it.  The directive does not compel the Government to introduce the Swedish derogation.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I require 30 seconds more.  The measure is being introduced to accommodate a minuscule subsection of those employed as agency workers.  We are not asking the Minister to get rid of the concept of permanent agency workers.  All we are asking him to do is stop permanent agency workers being excluded from the protections of the Bill.  There is no point in introducing something that can be used as a loophole when there is no obligation to do so and it will benefit only a category comprising a tiny minority which we are not asking to be abolished.  All we want is that these workers are not excluded from the protections in the Bill.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I am not quite sure the Minister grasps the point we are making and the concern we are expressing about a fundamental loophole in the entire thrust of the Bill.  I will spell it out to him.  Section 7(1) enunciates what I understand to be the absolute central kernel of the Bill, which is that the basic working and employment conditions to which an agency worker is entitled shall be the same as the basic working and employment conditions to which a comparable employee is entitled.  However, this shall not apply in so far as it relates to pay applied to an agency worker employed by an employment agency under a permanent contract of employment.  It is simple.  One has equality as an agency worker but not if one is employed permanently by the agency.  It is as simple as that.This is a way around the legislation.  It is a gaping hole in it.  If I were an agency I would see a very simple way to get around the legislation.  I would employ many people permanently, I would decide their pay and conditions and the equality demands of the legislation would not apply.  There will be nothing to stop an agency permanently employing nurses and paying them two thirds or half of what nurses normally earn because as permanent employees, the provisions of the legislation will not apply.  When these nurses work in a public or private hospital, they can be paid half of what nurses employed in the hospital are paid.The only requirement is that when the employees are not on assignment, they are paid at least 50% of what they were paid on their previous assignment.  What they got paid in the previous assignment could be virtually nothing or considerably less than what a comparable employee directly employed would receive.  The point is that this is a gaping hole in the legislation which fundamentally subverts the point of it.  It is an incentive to agencies to circumvent the demand for equality.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I cannot accept what the Deputies are saying.  This is an exemption for a situation where an employer offers temporary work but for the period the person is not working a retainer payment will be made.  This is a reasonable employment arrangement into which people can enter.  The Deputies want to outlaw such an arrangement.  I accept such an arrangement could be flexible and would justify paying less than the basic pay rate which would be applied to someone who commits to working a full working week.  This is the flexibility being allowed in the directive.  It is not a pattern that is much established here but it is not one that is abusive in its concept.  It could be a reasonable arrangement to enter into.Deputy Boyd Barrett seeks to portray a case where this would be entirely exploitative.  The truth is we are putting in place provisions whereby the agency must notify the agency worker in writing that if the agency worker enters into such a contract of employment, the provisions of section 7(1) will not apply.  The agency is also under obligation to make this a permanent contract of employment.  If it is abused, there will be a right of redress for the employee.  If it is used by an agency as a way of filling a short-term gap in a way that does not meet its obligations, it can be challenged before a rights commissioner in the normal way.The provision will allow certain flexibility for this arrangement.  It is fair that we leave it in the legislation.  It is a reasonable arrangement for people on both sides to enter into knowingly if it suits them, but it is not the case that people will be compelled to enter into such an arrangement.  An agency must notify people in writing and an agency worker must knowingly enter into it.  It provides a balance of protection on the two sides that we seek to have in the arrangement.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The Minister is fundamentally inaccurate.  He accuses speakers on this side of the House of trying to outlaw the arrangement of permanent agency workers.  They are not.  Nobody is objecting to the arrangement whereby a person can be a permanent agency worker.  What people on this side of the House who tabled amendments are objecting to is the notion that if somebody falls into this category, they are automatically excluded from the protection in the legislation.  This is unreasonable.I do not accept the so-called protections written in by the Minister will have any effect or impact whatsoever in practice.  It will be possible to employ somebody on low pay because all the agency has to pay them is a minimum of 50% of what the person received on the previous assignment.  People will be in the system to get employment because they need a job.  If they receive a letter from an employment agency, they will tacitly accept the conditions by not stating they object to them.  It will not do people any good to object because they will be told this is how it is.The Minister spoke about a permanent contract of employment.  I am very unclear about what that means.  It certainly does not mean somebody is obliged to be employed in 20 or 30 years time.  An employer can take on somebody today and state it is intended to make the position permanent but circumstances can change.  For a category of people who form only a tiny subsection of the totality of agency workers, and without any obligation being put on us by the EU directive,  we are introducing a provision into this Bill which can create a loophole through which employment agencies can drive a coach and four.  That is unnecessary and wrong.  The Minister should reflect between now and the Seanad debate with a view to withdrawing this unnecessary provision.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Will the Minister clarify one point?  Am I right to think that if a person registers with an agency and is in full-time employment, he or she is guaranteed?  I refer again to the construction sector.  If the labour rate in that area is €14.80 per hour, as it was, will the agency worker working full-time for the agency who goes on to the site full-time be guaranteed the same rate or can the agency pay him less?  I am a little confused.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The amendment allows that during the assignment a rate will be set which need not meet the rate that would apply to permanent workers.  However, there must be a commitment that when the person is not assigned, he or she is paid.  People will get a permanent contract.  These agency workers are not on temporary assignments but on permanent contract under which there are periods of assignment and non-assignment.  They are paid during both but the rate at which they are paid during the active work period need not necessarily be the comparable rate for a full-time employee of that employer.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	350	It is an arrangement whereby a person can enter into an agreement with an agency that gives him or her periods of work but also provides for periods during which he or she will be paid, even when not working.  It is a different type of contract but it must be permanent in that the person is taken on with a long-term contract that provides periods of assignment and non-assigment.  The agency commits to payment, even during the non-assigned periods, thereby making a commitment to guarantee the worker work or, during the periods when it cannot provide work, to pay a retainer fee.  It is an arrangement that may suit some people but not others.  We seek to allow this to be contemplated by the legislation provided the agency notifies the worker in writing, that the person knows what he or she is entering into, that there is a permanent contract that provides for it, and that it is not something which can be turned into a temporary assignment that can be terminated at will without the rate that would have applied being paid.  That is the model being allowed for here.Flexibility is provided for in the directive because this can be a fair way of working that can suit both sides where there is intermittent work and neither side knows the exact commitment involved.  It provides some protection to both sides.  There is certainty for the agency of being able to provide a service when it is needed and there is certainty for the worker that he or she will get a certain level of pay regardless of being assigned.  The arrangement allows both sides to meet needs they may have.  We seek to allow this flexibility.

In page 12, to delete lines 16 to 28.On Committee Stage I flagged to Deputies that I would revert in particular to section 13(2)(b) and (c)which relate to the charging of fees in respect of health and safety costs and Garda vetting.  In addition, I undertook to look more closely at paragraph (a) that proposed that employment agencies would be able to charge reasonable expenses in the context of providing training to improve the employability prospects of agency workers.  In essence, the amendment now proposed, which I know will be well received by Deputies, has the effect that the entirety of section 13(2) is being removed from the Bill.  I listened to views argued on Committee Stage and accepted them.  On that basis I propose to remove from the Bill any provision that allows for the charging of fees to agency workers in the context of the introduction of an individual for the purposes of his or her employment with a third party.

In page 20, after line 24, to insert the following:"26.—The employment agency and the employment to which the agency worker is assigned shall be jointly and severally liable for all breaches of this Act with the exceptions of the matters of facilities and amenities for which the employer who is end user shall be solely responsible.".My colleagues and I wish to place this section at the end of the legislation, after section 25.  It concerns complaints in respect of certain contraventions of the Act.  It is to ensure the employment agency and the employment to which the agency worker is assigned are jointly and severally liable for all breaches of the Act.  It will tighten this up because employers and the agency are well aware they must comply with this Act in regard to breaches, with the exception of matters of facilities and amenities for which the employer who is end user shall be solely responsible.  We ask for discussion of this provision and for the Minister to take it on board.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I support this amendment.  It is right and proper to place in primary legislation a responsibility on both the agency and the employer who avails of the agency worker and that there should be stringent legal protections in place within the primary legislation.Arising from the previous debate, although amendment No. 23 is welcome, the Minister should look at the Swedish derogation issue before this Bill goes to the Seanad.  The British Government has dealt reasonably well with this issue.  I urge the Minister to consider the debate we have had today on the Swedish derogation.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I, too, broadly support this amendment.  Basically, the position is that if a hirer signifies a wrong comparable employee, or if a hirer in some other way does not pay the agency worker that to which he or she is entitled, that worker will then have an action against the employment agency which is designated the employer, even though it is the hirer who is at fault.  The case will have to be taken against the employment agency, which will then have to take a case against the hirer.  That would require two sets of proceedings and the Minister should do what he can to avoid that.  As Deputy Nulty said, this was dealt with neatly in the UK legislation, which I examined some time ago.  While I have not read it recently, my impression was that it dealt with this issue much more neatly than is proposed in the Bill.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	359	Unless this issue is clarified, agency workers could be deprived of their rights because of the complexity of the enforcement process.  By specifying the end-user employer and agency as jointly and severally liable, employment tribunals would be allowed to determine where responsibility for breaches of regulation lay.  The amendment is necessary to this end, whether it involves the end-user employer or the agency.The unions have correctly pointed out that this would ensure that agency workers would always be able to establish their rights, which may not necessarily be the case unless the amendment is made, for example, where an agency or a user employer becomes insolvent or the contract for the supply of workers is outsourced through a chain of agencies, including some outside the jurisdiction.  This clarity is needed for legal purposes to assist enforcement and to ensure agency worker rights are protected in this regard.

Often the weakness in labour law relates to compliance and enforcement.  Employers who are not compliant seek ways to extend the time within which an individual can achieve justice and the penalty usually is the initial fine.  If an employer is of the view that he can draw the process out and dodge the case for a period knowing he will only be hit with the original penalty, there is a great incentive to do that.  I support the strengthening of the enforcement and compliance involved in this.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	361	With the exception of sections 11 and 14, as amended on Committee Stage, responsibility for breaches of the legislation is attributable to the employer of the agency worker given the direct employment relationship that exists between the two parties.  However, exceptionally in sections 11 and 14, which relate, respectively, to the rights of agency workers to vacancy notices relating to job opportunities at the hirer's undertaking and the right to access amenities and collective facilities at the hirer undertaking, responsibility for these aspects rests solely with the hirer.  For all other matters in respect of which a breach is claimed, the employment agency is responsible.In parallel with the provisions in sections 11 and 14, Schedule 2 proposes that, in these specific instances, the hirer undertaking has sole control and discretion over these aspects that can be taken before the rights commissioner.  For all other issues, the employer of the agency worker will potentially have a case for breach of the legislation taken before a commissioner.  However, an important consideration is that set out in section 15, which provides for the subsequent indemnification of the employer in the event that the breach which occurred, if proven, was incurred as a consequence of the failure of the hirer of the agency worker to provide accurate information to the employment agency in the first instance.I have taken advice on this approach and understand that this is a preferable route to take and is much simpler than the enjoining of two parties, only one of whom has responsibility for the breach.  This would have the undesirable effect of usurping the time and resources of all parties concerned, including the rights commissioner service, when there is a simpler solution.  For this reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.The legislation makes clear where the responsibility lies in each case where there is a failing.  If it clearly falls within the hirer's responsibility, namely, vacancies or not providing access to facilities, then the case is taken to the rights commissioner against the hirer.  If the breach relates to pay and conditions, the case is taken against the employer agency.  If the commissioner then rules in favour of the worker that the employment agency failed to provide the basic pay and conditions, he or she will make an award to the worker and the onus will fall on the employer, if he feels the responsibility lies with the hirer because he has given false information, to pursue him.  The worker is, therefore, not delayed while that new action is tried.  The onus is on the employer to go after the hirer for his failure under the contract between them.  This is cleaner and provides more direct access for workers to the rights commissioner to try the case if the hirer failed to give them access to collective conditions in the workplace.  They take a case and the process is clean.  If they take a case on pay and conditions, they take it against the agency and they win.  It is up to the agency then to pursue the employer.  I am advised this is cleaner and better for the worker to pursue his case with clarity as to who is responsible in each case and leaving the agency to pursue the contract it had with the hirer if there is a dispute following the award.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I do not see why the Minister objects to the amendment.  It seeks to establish a legal bottom line regarding compliance and enforcement in order that there will be no ambiguity.  The agency and the hirer would be jointly and severally responsible for breaches of the legislation and it would be clear that this was the case.  This would not preclude workers from going to the rights commissioner and so on.  We want a legal bottom line written into the legislation whereby agencies and hiring employers will be held responsible if they breach the Bill.  That is what the amendment seeks and I do not see why the Minister objects to it.  He should consider it a sensible and reasonable addition to the Bill.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	363	This approach is standard in other Bills such as the transfer of undertakings legislation and, therefore, we are not innovating.  If there is a clear obligation on the hirer, he will be responsible.  The case should be pursued against the hirer and it is the responsibility of the hirer to honour his obligations under the legislation as they relate to vacancy notices and workplace facilities.  If the case relates to basic pay and conditions, the employer is responsible but to make them jointly and severally liable is to pretend they are jointly responsible whereas the legislation has separated their responsibilities and established the line of responsibility clearly and a redress mechanism that makes it simpler for the worker to pursue a case against one or the other.  If the worker wins the case and the employer has a subsequent gripe, he must pursue it himself.  That is better and cleaner.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	364	As indicated to the Deputy in a written reply yesterday, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  These followed on the initiatives taken by the previous Minister for Finance who set up lending targets for the recapitalised banks.I can confirm to the Deputy that both banks have reported to the Minister for Finance that they have achieved their targets for 2011.  This information is currently being independently assessed by the Credit Review Office and will be dealt with in the report for the end of November 2011 which is due to be published shortly.I accept that the amounts sanctioned by the banks are but one measure of the provision of credit.  However, these amounts are within the control of the banks and are therefore an appropriate target for the banks.  The targets are kept under constant review in the context of levels of economic activity.Data are available from the Central Bank website on the actual drawdown of credit.  This indicates that gross new lending to non-financial SMEs by credit institutions in Ireland was €2.3 billion for the first nine months of 2011.  Figures are not yet available for quarter four of last year.  Drawdown is also monitored by my officials and the Credit Review Office and are reported to the EMC.Gross new lending details the amount of new credit facilities drawn down during the quarter by SME counterparties, that is, where this credit facility was not part of the outstanding amount of credit advanced at the end of the previous quarter.  Gross new lending is defined in such a way as to exclude renegotiation or restructuring of existing loans.  Gross new lending does not equate to loans sanctioned over the period.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The recent independent Mazars survey of SME credit found that 17% of respondents whose requests for credit were approved did not, either wholly or in part, avail of the facilities.  A higher proportion of new credit facilities had not been drawn down in comparison to renewed facilities.  The most frequent reasons cited for not availing of approved credit continue to be "not needed at present time", which was cited by 80% of respondents.  Given that the decision to draw down approved credit rests in the hands of the borrower, it would not be appropriate at this stage to impose targets for actual draw down on the banks.  It remains an important factor to monitor.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  What we all want to see is new credit circulating in the economy.  That is the reason I tabled this question.  The real test is the amount of new credit that is drawn down.  I take the Minister of State's point that the banks can only control the amount of credit they sanction but often sanctioning of new credit by the banks comes with such onerous terms and conditions that, in effect, it constitutes a refusal of credit and, in many cases, it is not a viable option for the customer to drawn it down.  Other issues are the interest rate charged and the types of collateral requirements being imposed by the banks.  Will the Minister of State re-examine this issue and as well as reporting the amount of credit that is sanctioned by the banks, will he report the amount of new credit which is drawn down?  He partially answered a question when he referred to the amount of new gross credit of €2.3 billion in the first nine months of last year.  That compares to the two pillar banks telling the Minister of State that they sanctioned €6 billion of new credit throughout the calendar year 2011.  A much more meaningful measure is the amount of credit drawn down and put into circulation in the economy.  I ask the Minister of State to re-examine that issue.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I agree with the Deputy that this is the key test of whether we can get the economy moving again, namely, getting credit out to SMEs in particular.  The climate has been challenging given the recent difficulties in the economy.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  We need more applications to come forward and a better processing regime by the banks.Some of the advances we have seen during the course of recent months are important and we have recognised that there is problem here for small businesses in particular, but it can be overcome.  We now have a common application form across all of the banking sector and the Internet can be used to ensure that applications are made in the most technological advanced way possible.  Also, the banks have been instructed to provide training, particularly for SMEs, and such training is important in drawing down the funds required.This is an issue that the Government has taken very seriously, as the Deputy knows.  The Economic Management Council meets on a regular basis with the banks.  Yesterday Department of Finance officials had the banks in with them.  The Deputy will be aware of the new revamped banking unit in the Department of Finance, which is involved in bilateral discussions with the banks on a weekly and monthly basis to make sure that we can get credit out there.In the last quarter of last year, we saw some significant improvement in terms of sanctioning.  It all very well to say to a small business that the credit is there for it but drawing it down is the key test.  I agree fully with the Deputy on that.  I reassure him and the House that this is a matter of absolute priority for the Government.  Significant progress has been made and we will continue in that vein.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am glad he acknowledged that the key test is the draw down of new credit by businesses in the country.  I am concerned that we are still witnessing a situation of revolving credit where banks are bundling existing credit facilities such as overdrafts and company credit cards that businesses have, repackaging them as term loans and reporting them to the Government as new credit which they are not.  They are recycled credit.When this issue is being reported upon, I would like the Minister of State to note the figures from the Central Bank and compare the amount of new credit drawn down and put into circulation in the economy with what the banks tell him they have sanctioned.  Only then can we get a real handle and picture of the amount of credit that is being put into circulation to allow existing businesses to continue and new investments to be created.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I welcome the Deputy's constructive remarks.  This is a challenge particularly as we proceed through 2012.  The Taoiseach has rightly pointed out that this is the year when the investment jobs agenda is the crucial test for us all to get people back to work.  That will not happen unless we can provide funds into the real economy.It is important to state also that the whole of Government is taking this issue very seriously.  One of the issues we have identified is the need for equity in many of these businesses.  Credit is one thing but the only way one will draw it down is if one has capital.  Part of the problem is that micro-businesses in particular do not have access to the 10% or 20% required up-front to draw down the amount.  That is something on which we are very focused, particularly the new micro-financing fund which was established by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in consultation and in co-operation with the Department of Finance.  The key test is to get the capital in place in order that these funds can be there for investment.Many businesses in the middle of an economic turmoil spend much of their time deleveraging, writing off debt, paying down debt and not seeing investment.  This climate will change when we ensure that lending gets out into the real economy.The independent Mazars report, of which the Deputy will be aware, made the net point last year in terms of last year's lending that when the pending applications are excluded, the approval rate is about 70% at present.  We need to get money out into the economy but we also need to have applications coming through.  We also need to use the Credit Review Office as a means of making sure that money gets out into the economy.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	369	As the Deputy is aware I have indicated that I am committed to reviewing the approach to the promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State of correcting the banking system.  The troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish officials to produce a common paper which will consider options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the maturity of the notes, the interest rate, the cash flows and so on.  Work is ongoing on this review.The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of parties involved in this process and it involves all the member states of the European Union and particularly the members of the eurozone.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the situation in the eurozone remains unsettled and is changing on a daily basis.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any detail about various options under consideration in advance of the conclusion of the considerations and the production of a common paper.  Suffice to say that a broad range of options are under detailed consideration.  Additional detail on the various proposals will be available when the ongoing work is further advanced.In tandem with this technical review the Government has commenced a campaign at a political level to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State.  The Minister for Finance and I met the Commissioner Mr. Rehn and Mr. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, as well as a number of counterparts from member states, to make progress on this matter.  The Taoiseach has also met and discussed this issue with a number of European Council members.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to indicate when the review of options and negotiations will be completed.  The Government is aware that payment of the promissory note is due at the end of March 2012.  However, given the nature of advocacy and the decision-making process in the EU, I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.The Government is committed to achieving an outcome that not only serves Ireland's best interests but that is in the best interests of our external partners.  It is of the view that the global and European economies and the financial markets will benefit from a speedy return to growth in the Irish economy.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I am sure he is well aware that last week three expert economists - Professor Karl Whelan, Professor Brian Lucey, and Dr. Stephen Kinsella - appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and made presentations on the promissory note issue.  It would be fair to say that all three of them stated that what really needs to be dealt with is the capital of €31 billion.  There was concern that the Government is focusing on either extending the maturities or obtaining a reduction in the interest rate, which, as Professor Whelan said in his presentation, is irrelevant in the long run because it will go back to the Central Bank and then it will go back to the State.I heard what the Minister of State said about considering maturities, interest rates and so on.  Is the capital part of that?  I am not looking for any State secrets to be given away, but is the Irish State, as part of these discussions, seeking a write-down on the capital that is to be injected into Anglo Irish Bank?  I know the Minister of State cannot say when the paper will be produced, but does he expect that it will not be produced before the payment on 31 March?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I thank the Deputy for that.  On the latter issue, we have not set any specific timeframes.  Something we wanted to see happen for quite some time was a joint approach by the ECB, the IMF and the European Commission.  They are working on the paper, and the Minister for Finance has made it clear that when it is produced, the issue will be brought to the political arena.  Given the difficulties we have all had to cope with at a European level, and now that the Greek issue has hopefully been resolved in the medium term, this and other issues will now come on the agenda and progress can be made.  We do not have any specific timeframes, which is important.On the issue of the capital and the interest, while we are considering all options, I do not think there is any indication in anything the Minister for Finance has said that we are looking for a significant write-down on the totality of the debt.  What the Minister has said is that the key issue for the Government is to redesign the promissory note, either in terms of maturity or of the interest rate itself, because this has effectively become a sovereign debt by virtue of the fact that the bank was nationalised and the assets and liabilities guaranteed.  We want to ensure the best possible outcome but, as we have said in the past, that will be achieved by agreement.  We will not take some radical unilateral position on this.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	372	It is disappointing to hear a Government member say again that the focus is on the interest rate and the maturity, because this will result, in the long term, in the same amount of money being transferred to Anglo Irish Bank from the State.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the papers that Professor Whelan, in particular, presented at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Does he accept that a reduction in the interest rate on the promissory note - that is, the interest rate we are paying to Anglo Irish Bank - is irrelevant in the long term, although it is relevant in the short term in terms of our Government debt levels and our general Government deficit?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The whole payment is relevant to Ireland because, by making these payments, we are making our situation more difficult.  However, the point we have stressed is that we are not seeking a specific write-down.  We think this can be managed in a more productive way if we redesign the entire mechanism.  Our approach before the election, during the election and on coming into office has been to renegotiate all these matters, making sure we do not take an action that jeopardises our position.  Our approach last year to saving €10 billion on the interest rate on the bailout money over the course of the loans made a significant financial difference to the State.  That was brought about by agreement and negotiation, and that is the same approach we are taking here.  I accept that the approach taken by the previous Administration in putting this financial mechanism in place was difficult and it will make our position more difficult in terms of long-term sustainability, but the bigger issue is the need to obtain external funds for investment here and to buy Irish debt when we ultimately return to the markets.  I do not think we can achieve that by saying we will impose a massive write-down on the debt.  It would not engender confidence.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	374	This touches on the questions raised by Deputy Doherty.  I very much welcome the constructive contribution from the economists on the question of the promissory notes, and I assure the Deputy that the presentations and remarks to the joint committee will be examined in detail.  However, it would not at all be appropriate for me to unilaterally instruct the Central Bank and the troika that the scheduled payment will not be made at a time when we are engaged in a process to review options for a reduction in the overall burden to the State of restructuring our banking sector by varying the cost or timing, or both, of the repayment of that debt.The Deputy will be aware that the Government made a commitment, along with all 27 member states, at the euro summit in October last year.  For the information of the House I will put that commitment on the record:As far as our general approach to private sector involvement in the euro area is concerned, we reiterate our decision taken on 21 July 2011 that Greece requires an exceptional and unique solution.All other euro area Member States solemnly reaffirm their inflexible determination to honour fully their own individual sovereign signature and all their commitments to sustainable fiscal conditions and structural reforms.  The euro area Heads of State or Government fully support this determination as the credibility of all their sovereign signatures is a decisive element for ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole.The Irish Government will honour this commitment and will ensure that we work with our EU partners to address the overall cost to the State of resolving the difficulties in our banking sector, including the promissory notes.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseFurther, I am not convinced that in the event that it may be deemed advisable to make the promissory note payment due under the current schedule in March, it will weaken our position in the ongoing review.  It is simply not my experience or that of the Government that this is how things work within the European Union or the eurozone.  I remind the Deputy that our external partners are engaging in these discussions notwithstanding the fact that a payment of €3.06 billion was already made in March 2011.While it would certainly be beneficial to have the matter of the promissory note payments resolved and agreed by the end of March, there is no guarantee that this will be achieved in that time frame.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of parties involved directly and indirectly in the process.  He will also appreciate that the situation in the eurozone remains unsettled and is changing on a daily basis.  In this environment, and given the nature of advocacy and the decision-making process in the EU, I do not expect this matter to be concluded quickly.  However, I assure the Deputy that everything that can be done will be done to ensure a positive outcome for the State.

Professor Brian Lucey told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week: "[O]nce we start paying under the present schedule it will be next to impossible to renegotiate that schedule or to get out from under it."  Is it not true that we have a short window of opportunity between now and 31 March to address this issue on the basis of what Professor Lucey has said?  If it is not addressed and solved before 31 March we will be forced into this situation for the long term and the austerity we have now will continue almost forever.  The effect is that these promissory notes will cost us at least €47 billion, although other estimates go as far as €74 billion or even €85 billion.  Is there not now a narrow window of opportunity to deal with this matter?  If we do not deal with it before 31 March, will we not be in serious difficulty?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I am sure the Deputy is aware that we paid it last year, admittedly without the interest component, and the world did not change.  While we are conscious of the difficulties this imposes on the State, the €3.1 billion was paid last year.  People need to be aware of that fact.We have taken an incremental approach to the negotiations with our external funders.  Last year we managed to renegotiate the deal in the case of the minimum wage, the total cost of the bailout money, whether new loans should be sent to the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and, as was seen today, whether we could use the proceeds from the sale of State assets for the purposes of investment and job creation in the economy.  It is the considered view of the Government that this incremental, step-by-step approach to solving our problems is far more useful than an approach based on shouting, roaring and screaming at the top of one's voice to try to impose things on others.  This is an outstanding issue-----

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	381	To answer Deputy Healy, this is an important issue for the Government and we are prioritising it.  We have made some advances in how it will progress between now and the full schedule.  Just because the Government is not talking about it daily does not mean it is not devoting all its efforts to getting the point across.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	382	This is not a question of roaring, shouting or screaming.  It is a practical and seriously difficult problem for the country, particularly for low and middle income families.  Economic advisers have clearly said that if we continue to pay under this schedule, it will be impossible to renegotiate.  I worry, too, about the reference to interest rates.  As Deputy Doherty said, the economists have also indicated that dealing with the interest rate is effectively irrelevant in the long term.  We must deal with the capital repayment and deal with it now.  Surely it is time for us to stand up for ourselves and state we cannot and will not pay.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The Deputy might have the luxury of saying we cannot and will not pay, but he should be aware of the consequences.  The country is being held together with emergency funding from the ECB.  The cost of running the country which presents a real difficulty given the current deficit is also borne by the external support of these agencies.I agree with the Deputy that the issue remains unresolved, but we are working hard to find a solution.  We have seen the resolution of the Greek problem in the past 48 hours following the eurozone meeting.  This might well give us the space and time to prioritise the issue and ensure our partners understand its significance.  The Deputy should understand the troika has moved position in more recent times.  It would be useful if it produced a joint position paper on the issue which would, at least, allow us to know the common position of the troika in whatever negotiations that would follow.  However, I share the Deputy's frustration and anxiety to have something done about this.  We are working on the issue.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 81 to 83, inclusive, of 12 January 2012.  It was never expected that 150,000 pensioners would have extra tax liabilities.  In that reply I stated the Revenue Commissioners had advised me that in some cases the pensioners were paying too much, in others too little and that others would be exempt.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have amended the records of those persons in receipt of Department of Social Protection pensions in 2012 with the most up-to-date information received from that Department.  This ensures these taxpayers will pay the correct amount of tax this year on all their known income sources.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners advise that they have issued tax exemption certificates to the employer and pension providers of some 15,000 taxpayers whom they believe will be exempt from tax in 2012, even with the full Department of Social Protectin pension taken into account.  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners state they will shortly automatically review the tax position of a further 20,000 taxpayers to ensure they did not overpay tax in 2011.The Revenue Commissioners also advise that for the past number of weeks since taxpayers received the letters in question, they have been updating their records with information supplied on foot of direct contacts by the taxpayers where they, until now, did not have the most complete and up-to-date information available to them.  Furthermore, at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 11 January the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners indicated that additional analysis had to be carried out and that work was still ongoing.The Revenue Commissioners further advise that discussions with groups representing pensioners are ongoing and that they will be in a position to publish a number of additional "frequently asked questions" by the end of the week.  Regarding the budget estimate of additional yield, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimate of €45 million for additional liabilities due is still valid.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	385	It was stated at the time the 150,000 letters were issued to pensioners by the Revenue Commissioners in early January that it was estimated 115,000 of the 150,000 pensioners would have an extra tax liability.  I had hoped that by today the Revenue Commissioners would have given the Minister of State an up-to-date picture of the compliance initiative and where it stood for the pensioners concerned.  Pensioners in my constituency have come to me with the letter they received.  Many of them were told in the letter that they had an extra tax liability but on investigation it was clear to me that they certainly did not.  That was subsequently confirmed on inquiry with the Revenue Commissioners.  Many pensioners were unnecessarily frightened by the letter issued in early January.  The information I am seeking - if it is not yet available, perhaps the Minister will indicate when it is likely to be available - is how many of the pensioners who received the letter will actually have an extra tax liability in 2012.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	386	My officials advise me that a P35 contains the basic information given to the system by employers who each year inform the Revenue Commissioners and the social welfare system of the total amount of tax paid.  We cannot give the Deputy the information because we do not have access to the P35s for 2012.  Obviously, that information will come in.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners will have some indicative figures in the coming months on the key question asked by the Deputy.  However, it is not possible to give them because the P35s are not in.  When they are, we will have more knowledge.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Contact has been made by the pensioners with the Revenue Commissioners to clarify their individual circumstances.  As the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advised the committee a number of weeks ago, thousands of pensioners have been in contact with the Revenue Commissioners by telephone and making inquiries at offices of the Revenue Commissioners.  In many of these cases the information was provided, the position was clarified and it was confirmed that the pensioners concerned had no extra tax liability.  We should be given information on the actual position as soon as possible.  Some 20,000 pensioners were believed to be owed money by the Revenue Commissioners.  Has this yet been processed?  Many pensioners were advised that they should complete Form 12 in respect of their return in 2011, but that form is not yet available from the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope that matter will be attended to without delay.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank the Deputy for bringing the latter issue to my attention.  The information will be passed on immediately to the Revenue Commissioners to obtain a view on it.The payment of back tax is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners.  Last year the Minister brought legislation through the Oireachtas to ensure the Revenue Commissioners would be an independent, statutory organisation and not under the thumb or control of anybody.  The Deputy is aware of this and not making that charge against the Minister for Finance.  The Revenue Commissioners have already said stated the back tax issue will be examined on a case by case basis.  The P35 form for 2011 was due to be filled in by a pension provider or employer on or before 15 February this year.I am further advised that the first automatic review process will start before the end of March.It is my understanding the Revenue Commissioners have taken the 115,000 cases on a phased basis.  In a few months time we will be in a better position to give an accurate view of the total liability involved.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recently published third quarter 2011 accounts.NAMA presents its financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards, IFRS.  It is required to do so under EU legislation owing to the fact it has listed debt securities.  In accordance with the IFRS, NAMA uses the effective interest rate, EIR, methodology for the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has certified that the 2010 financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the IFRS and give a true and fair view.NAMA accounts for the loans it has acquired by reference to the acquisition price from the financial institutions, not the original par value of the loans.  NAMA acquired a distressed loan portfolio at a significant discount to the original par value using a collateral based valuation model which projected the expected property related cash flows and the expected receipts from the ultimate disposal of the underlying property collateral.  A significant portion of the loans that NAMA acquired are not expected to perform in accordance with their contractual terms.  As a result, NAMA expects that the most significant portion of the cash generated will be through the future disposal of the property collateral underlying the loans, not from the receipt of contractual interest.Interest income is recognised on loans in accordance with the EIR method by reference to the expected property related cash flows on a proportionate basis over the life of the loans, rather than on a cash received or contracted interest basis, so as to accurately reflect the effective rate of return over the expected life of the loans.  Thus the aim of the EIR methodology is to allocate interest income on NAMA's loan book proportionately over the life of a loan, regardless of the timing of cash receipts, ensuring performance is reported on a consistent basis between accounting periods.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Deputy suggested reporting interest actually received.  However, NAMA advises that actual cash interest received is not an accurate reflection of performance because it does not reflect the fact that the return to NAMA is principally based on the sale of the underlying property.  If actual cash interest received was used, income would be significantly understated in the period up until the disposal of the underlying property and overstated in the period when the disposal actually took place.In accordance with the IFRS accounting standards, the effective interest rate is set on the acquisition of the loan.  To the extent that subsequently there is a change in the timing or amount of NAMA's cash flow expectations, whether it be favourable or unfavourable, the IFRS requires that NAMA adjust the carrying value of the loan and recognise an impairment charge or gain in its income statement.  This estimate of impairment is made on an annual basis.  I understand NAMA is carrying out a detailed annual impairment review for the period to the end of 2011.In the circumstances outlined, I do not consider that the use of the EIR methodology by the agency overstates its profits or gives a misleading picture of its operations.  However, following comments made at the Committee of Public Accounts, NAMA has advised that it is examining with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General how it could enhance its disclosures on the movement in the original par value of NAMA's loans.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I find this bizarre.  I have listened to the Minister of State's response in explaining how the EIR accounting practice works.  In the first three quarters of 2011 NAMA reported an operational profit of €526 million.  This is before impairment charges which are likely to wipe out that profit and result in NAMA having an operational loss are taken into account.  We can all accept this.  Let us forget about the impairment charges.  Of the operational profit of €526 million NAMA states it made, it did not receive €249 million.  It is booking interest on loans it has not received because it is using the EIR accountancy method.  It may never receive this money.  Does the Minister of State agree that, at a minimum, NAMA should report the actual amount in interest received on the loans during those quarters alongside what is projected in order that there would be a clearer and truer picture for the public?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	391	NAMA is following an international model where a vehicle such as this purchases loans at a hugely discounted rate to reflect the fact that the assets have been totally impaired.  This is in line with the international standard to which we have signed up.  Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General would not certify accounts if he considered there was something untoward about the accounting procedures involved.  Is the Deputy suggesting we move to using new methodology?  The immediate impact would be a radical increase in the administrative and legal charges associated with the management of the property portfolio.  I am not suggesting the Deputy is arguing for this, but it would be the impact of what he is suggesting.  That would not be a useful exercise at a time when we are all trying to minimise costs.  There is nothing untoward in the way the information is reported, either in terms of our domestic procedures or international obligations.  This vehicle which I call the NAMA ship as it leaves port uses existing legislation to reflect the fact that the assets were purchased at a discount.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The public wants to see what is going on within the ship of NAMA, a body which is costing €1 million a day to run.  It wants to know the income it received in interest on loans.  The report shows that €276 was received in the first quarter, but I have discovered that NAMA actually received only €178 million.  In the second quarter it reported that it had received €255 million in interest, but it had actually received only €184 million.  For the third quarter the corresponding figures were €255 million and €175 million.  NAMA is still not subject to the Freedom of Information Acts which should be a matter of urgency for the Government.  For a member of the public who is disposed to look at what NAMA is costing and the profit it is making, alongside the EIR figures which are  guesstimates of what NAMA might receive some time in the future, there should be a record of what it actually receives in interest during the various quarters.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The Deputy has a fair point to make on the Freedom of Information Acts.  I have heard similar comments being made by other Members of the House.  This is something at which the Government is looking.  We have given a commitment to amend the legislation.  In that context, we will look at applying freedom of information legislation to NAMA, or parts of it.  This would lead to the provision of useful information for all Deputies and the public.Are we comparing apples and oranges?  NAMA has purchased the assets at supremely discounted prices.  The Deputy's question is whether this should be reflected in the actual value they once had or at their current market value.  We can look at that aspect.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	394	That is not the question.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	395	We can look at whether additional reportage would make much difference.  The discounted value reflects the fact that a significant portion of the loans NAMA acquired were not performing on acquisition and are not expected to perform in accordance with their contractual terms.  This must be reflected in NAMA's accounting procedures.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General had a difficulty with this or believed an unusual accountancy procedure was involved, this would have been reflected in the ongoing reports his office produces.  We will keep the matter under review.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The Central Bank of Ireland does not disclose the value of the IBRC's liabilities to it.  However, details of Anglo Irish Bank's primary sources of funding are disclosed in the former bank's interim report for the six months to 30 June 2011 which are accessible at the following link.  The accounts will be updated in the IBRC annual report and accounts for 2011 due for publication at the end of March.As at 30 June 2011 the figure for the Anglo Irish Bank interim accounts, adjusted to include an estimated figure for the INBS, was about €45 billion for deposits from banks, primarily central banks, which provides an approximation of the total liability of the bank to the Central Bank at the time.  This figure is expected to reduce to circa €40 billion in the annual accounts which represents the gross cost to the Exchequer to repay the liability to the Central Bank of Ireland as of that date. In addressing the question of the net amount that would be required by the bank from the State to pay the total liability to the Central Bank of Ireland it is necessary to look at how the work-out of the remaining assets and liabilities might provide some offset to the liability to the Central Bank of Ireland.  At this time it is not possible, with any degree of accuracy, to indicate what the figure, if any, might be.  The restructuring plan agreed between the Irish authorities and the European Commission required the IBRC to be capitalised for a work-out of the assets over ten years.  The capital provided for the IBRC by the State totalled €34.7 billion which was financed by €4 billion in cash, €100 million for the special investment share and €30.6 billion, that is, €25.3 billion for Anglo Irish Bank and €5.3 billion for the INBS, in the promissory note which carries an interest coupon.  The amount of money required by the IBRC to repay total liabilities, including liabilities to the Central Bank of Ireland, over this period is subject to material uncertainty and market factors which include the expected timing of asset recoveries and sales, which are dependant on property prices, especially in the United Kingdom and Ireland; the volume and timing of maturing funding commitments and deposits; and projected interest rates within the euro area. http://www.ibrc.ie/About_us/Financial_information/Latest_interim_report/Interim_Report_2011.pdf.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I tabled this question following from the presentations made to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, to ascertain the schedule of repayment of the promissory note which takes us right up to 2031.  Because of the way the Government has booked the interest on that promissory note, which was at the market value at that time, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation does not need that total sum of €47 billion to clear all of its liabilities and the actual sum is probably much less, in the region of €37 billion.  The argument being put forward is that the State, even if it was to get no change in terms of the promissory note, would not be still paying the promissory note post-2022 or - allowing for variances on impairments, and so on - 2023, but that the amount of capital that Irish Bank Resolution Corporation needs is in the region of €37 billion, not the €47 billion to pay all of the bank's liabilities.  Hypothetically, if the Minister was able to sign a cheque today for €37 billion to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, and it could sell its other assets to clear some of its other liabilities, we could wind the bank up with nearly immediate effect, and that is the point to which I am trying to get.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I was aware that the three economists in question raised this issue in the course of their presentation to the committee, but the three economists do not have access to the books of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and how they can make that definitive statement is difficult to attain.I understand Deputy Pearse Doherty's point.  He is correct that when the promissory note procedure was put in place there was an average set out for the period of time, but, as he will be aware, that goes up or down.  In trying to calculate with any degree of accuracy the total amount involved, Deputy Doherty, for the information of the House, gave the figure of €37 billion.  It could be less than €40 billion.  Who knows?  In the circumstances of where we are at present, it is impossible to be definitive.I also make the point, of which Deputy Pearse Doherty will be well aware, that much will also depend upon how much of this stuff we can sell.  He is probably aware of a very substantial sale of these assets last year in the United States which was able to realise quite a considerable portion.The variables will be: how much we can get rid of and where that interest rate will be.  That is why it is difficult to be definitive at this stage.  We are working at a process that has still another ten years to go.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Given that Irish Bank Resolution Corporation is owned by the State and the Department of Finance is the Department which, on 31 March this year, will sign a cheque for €3.1 billion to that bank, I presume that there are talks between both of them on how much this will cost and the cut-off point for this promissory note.  Given that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had the talks with Mr. Trichet and Mr. Rehn on 17 September last to set up these technical talks, I presume that such information is already available.  Five months on from the agreement to have these technical talks on the promissory note, the least we would have is a good assumption - that is all it can be - of the total cost to the State.  Wrapping everything up together, what is the amount the State needs to transfer to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation to meet its liability?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	400	These are estimates and they are ball-park figures.  The Deputy can be absolutely assured that in our discussions, both with our international funders and the ECB, in particular, these matters are being kept under review.However, I would be unwise to speculate either as to the range of that or the total liability concerned at this stage, because even if we were to be successful in the redesign of the promissory note, there are a number of areas that must be considered.  One does not want a situation where a redesign in the long run would be more difficult for us by virtue of the fact of changing interest rates.  Those are the kind of issues that must be sorted.However, I accept what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying.  There is a necessity to make progress on this and that is what we are working hard to achieve.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	401	As the Minister of State will be aware, the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was based on an estimate of its losses - somewhere in the range of €29 billion to €34 billion.  Some months ago, the chairman of the bank, Mr. Alan Dukes, revised that estimate, stating that it could well be as low as €25 billion.  The picture has become somewhat clearer recently with the sale of a substantial element of the bank's loan book portfolio.  Is €25 billion the Government's current best estimate of the overall cost, aside from the promissory note structure, of the losses at Irish Bank Resolution Corporation?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I note that Deputy Michael McGrath referred to information that was put out there by the chairman at the time, and that is the bank's view.  Here again, this will depend on the functioning property market.  As the Deputy will be aware, much of the assets involved were purchases here in Ireland, but also in the United Kingdom.  As they are sold over a period of time, and as that is reflected in the ultimate price, we will get a better knowledge of this.  Deputy Michael McGrath wants me to commit to what the chairman said and I am not in a position to do that.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	403	As noted in the action plan for jobs, the strategic investment fund, SIF, whose establishment was announced by the Government in September 2011, will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, towards productive investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.  As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private sector investors.  It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs.  The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.The NPRF's investment in the SIF will, like its existing investments, be on a commercial basis.  Accordingly, such investment will not be classified as general Government expenditure in statistical terms and there will be no implications for the continued achievement of the general Government deficit targets we are committed to under the EU-IMF programme.  Further investment by the NPRF in Ireland on a strictly commercial basis does not represent a material change in the purpose of the NPRF.The resulting greater concentration of investment in Ireland on the part of the NPRF is expected to require the amendment of the NPRF's investment policy, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, as the manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.On the amount of money available in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency that, at 31 December last, the total value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Discretionary Portfolio was €5.4 billion, of which €2.1 billion is in equities, €1.2 billion is in eurozone bonds and cash, and €2 billion is in alternative assets including private equity, property, commodities, infrastructure and absolute return funds.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	404	As the Minister of State will be aware, for quite a while my party has been arguing that we use a portion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fund a stimulus programme for investment to get people back to work.  Given that there are 439,000 on the live register and 6,000 people leaving the State every month in search of work, we definitely need to use that discretionary portfolio.The question is very focused.  The Government announced its jobs plan, in which key action No. 12 states: "Through the Strategic Investment Fund, channel commercial investment from the NPRF and matching investment from private sector investors towards productive investment in the Irish economy."  While I welcome that, I want to know, given this is one of the key actions in the jobs plan, how much money the Government is ear-marking for investment.  Obviously, the investment is commercial so the sector will have to tap into it.  What pool of money is available for channelling commercial investment?  Is it the full €5.4 billion or a portion of that?  What discussion has the Government had with the troika?  Is the troika agreeable to the level of funding that is available?  It is clear that €250 million is available to the infrastructure fund.  What is not clear is what pool of money is available for the commercial investment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I will read the final paragraph of my original reply, which may help the Deputy.  The reply states:It should be noted that these funds are not all readily accessible.  The NPRF commission has legally committed €1.2 billion to various fund investments, of which over €800 million is for investment in Ireland.  The €800 million includes a commitment to provide funding on a commercial basis for the roll-out of the water metering programme, subject to certain other preconditions.I agree with the Deputy that, at a time of such high unemployment, we have to strategically use the funds we have for the purposes of investment.  He will note the decision of the Government yesterday and the announcement of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, today in respect of the disposal of State assets and how we can use a proportion of that sale for the purposes of investment in the real economy.In the original negotiations with the troika, as the Deputy is probably aware, there was a view that as State assets were sold, the totality of the sale should go towards debt writedown.  That is a position I suspect he, I and everyone else would fundamentally disagree with on the basis that if we have assets that can be used for productive purposes, we need those now in the economy.  The announcement made by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, this morning and the Government decision taken yesterday, particularly as these assets are sold on a strategic basis, will mean that up to a third of that investment can be used for productive purposes within the economy.The Government is mindful of this.  We produced a jobs strategy but this must be backed up by hard cash and support where it is commercially useful and where it can leverage additional support.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	406	This is a very simple question, so I will repeat it.  Proposal No. 12 is one of the key proposals in the Government's jobs action plan.  It proposes to channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to productive investment.  The question is how much money has the Government agreed with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, how much has it calculated will be available for this purpose and whether the troika has agreed to that figure.  It is very simple.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	407	In November 2011 the National Pensions Reserve Fund announced a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund, which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas.  It will invest in infrastructural assets here in Ireland, including assets being disposed of by the Government and commercial State assets.There is also an opportunity, of which the Deputy may not be aware, through the European Investment Bank.  Talks proceed in terms of leveraging additional support, which is one of the key issues the Taoiseach raised in the course of his recent discussions at a Council meeting.  Obviously, if funds can be leveraged for investment in infrastructure and other purposes via the European Investment Bank, that would be another useful step.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The Government is in the process of establishing the strategic investment fund, which is a welcome development and can be used to channel investment into viable commercial projects.  In that regard, is the Minister open to the proposal we made in our budget document in December and which is also supported by ICTU, that a portion of the €70 billion of assets held by Irish pension funds would be accessed and made available for investment through the strategic investment fund into commercial projects in Ireland?  Will he consider this?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I note the comments made in the past on this matter by the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  He is open to considering this.  My understanding is that he will open a consultation process with the pensions industry soon, which could lead to an opportunity to use some of that resource.  We are in an unusual position in that much of the pension funds that are collected here are not actually used here, as the Deputy knows.To go back to the point made by Deputy Doherty, at a time when we have such high levels of unemployment, it makes sense to tap into the potential this could offer.  There are obviously complicated factors in this regard which must be worked out.  However, the Minister has said he is open to this.  His consultation, as I understand it, will begin over the course of the next few months.  If proposals came from the industry on how those funds could be leveraged towards investment purposes here, we are very open to that and would welcome it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.As the Deputy is aware, I have indicated that I am committed to reviewing the approach to the promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State of correcting the banking system.  The troika has agreed to engage in a process with Irish officials to produce a common paper which will consider options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the maturity of the notes, the interest rate, the cash flows and so on.  Work is ongoing on this review.The Deputies will appreciate that there are several parties involved in this process and it involves all the member states of the European Union, particularly the members of the eurozone.  The Deputies will also appreciate that the situation in the eurozone remains unsettled and is changing on a daily basis.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any detail about various options under consideration in advance of the conclusion of the considerations and the production of a common paper.  Suffice to say that a broad range of options are under detailed consideration.  Additional detail on the various proposals will be available when the ongoing work is further advanced.In tandem with this technical review, the Government has commenced a campaign at political level to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State.  The Minister has met the Commissioner Mr. Rehn and Mr. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, as well as a number of his counterparts from member states to progress the matter.  The Taoiseach has also met and discussed the issue with a number of EU Council members.Unfortunately, I am not in a position to indicate when the review of options and the negotiations will be completed.  The Government is aware of the payment due on the promissory note at the end of March 2012.  However, given the nature of advocacy and the decision-making process in the EU, I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.  I do not expect that any possible solution will be adversely impacted if we do not have the matter resolved by the end of March.  The Deputy will be aware the payment due in March is, in fact, the second payment off the principal amount, as the last was paid last year.The Government is committed to achieving an outcome which not only serves Ireland's best interests but is also in the best interests of our external partners.  The Government is of the view that the global and European economies and the financial markets will benefit from a speedy return to growth in the Irish economy.  It is the view of the Government that this solution must involve a reduction in the overall burden to the State of restructuring our banking sector in terms of either or both the cost and the timing of the repayment of that debt.

We held the line to support European financial stability in the midst of our own financial chaos.  Does the Minister of State not feel we have earned the right to have a timely response to this issue in regard to whether the ECB will extend, write down or introduce some element of delay to the payments?  This is an important issue that affects both sides of the House and it is necessary that this message is got through to the ECB and our colleagues in Europe.Has the concept of winding down Anglo Irish Bank been considered?  It has no deposits in the normal sense.  It is a zombie bank, with little or no effect on the wider economy.  If it had been signalled well in advance that Anglo Irish Bank would be wound down faster than currently envisaged, it would not have had any effect on the market.There is a need for people in this country and for Members of this House to know what the European Central Bank is thinking.  A delegation from the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform travelled to Germany recently-----

During our recent visit to Germany, a German MP told committee delegates that there is a simple rule in Germany.  If one borrows money one must pay it back.  The Minister of State spoke about the eurozone being unsettled.  Part of the problem is that there is too much secrecy and we are not getting the answers we require quickly enough.  The governing council of the ECB very much controls what the bank can and cannot do.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I understand the Deputy's frustration, which is felt on all sides of the House, concerning the outstanding liability to the State arising from the criminal reckless lending of a bank which effectively brought this country to its knees.  The dilemma - to take my ship analogy - is that the ship has left dock.  The decision was made by the previous Administration when, in the first instance, it guaranteed the bank's assets and liabilities-----

The problem is that reneging on that contract is seen, from the European perspective, as a form of default.  We are arguing that the bank is effectively now functioning as a type of financial warehouse in that its task, over a period of time, is to outwork the assets and liabilities that are there.  We are making progress in articulating that to people.  Deputy Broughan and the other Deputies who attended the Bundestag recently will have heard the very strong German view, which crosses party lines, that this is a sovereign debt commitment.I reiterate that if we were to take the position that the State will not meet that commitment, there would be a dramatic effect on the reputation of the country just as we have moved from the collapse phase to the recovery phase.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	418	One of the reasons that our ten-year bond yields have improved so significantly, with the interest charged declining from 14.5% to less than 7% over a period of months, is the view that has grown that Ireland is now a sound place in which to invest.  If we were to go down the road, as Greece has done, of arguing for private sector investment - effectively debt write-offs - how could we then construct an argument that Ireland is a safe place to do business, a secure location in which to invest and a country from which one would wish to buy Government debt?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	419	The Minister of State is giving us very bad news in telling us that he will achieve nothing by 31 March.  Even though he is one year in office, he has achieved nothing in that time.  He claims that €3.1 billion was paid last year and the world did not change.  In fact, the world did change for schoolchildren, patients and people on benefit.  We have seen the capital investment programme slashed right, left and centre.  There is no denying that the world changed as a consequence of paying that €3.1 billion.  While some cutbacks have been rolled back - the reversal in regard to schools in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme was largely achieved by my former colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party - great suffering has been inflicted on people as a consequence of that payment.  That is why the coming payment represents such a significant date for this country.The Minister of State is being very disparaging to the Greek nation.

The Government came in at the end, so to speak.  The Minister for Finance is going out to Europe week after week but is achieving nothing with this nicely nicely approach to Chancellor Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy.  Is the Minister of State saying definitively that he will not achieve anything in the short term?  In other words, are we being told that this payment will be made even though it will crucify our country in 2014, with €2 billion worth of interest payments leading inevitably to reductions in essential social spending?In regard to the technical discussion raised by colleagues on this side of the House, is one of the issues under discussion the mark-to-market interest rate which the Fianna Fáil Party disgracefully and in a treasonable way attached to the promissory note in 2010?  Will the Government attempt to roll that back based on a maturity date, as we have been advised to do at the finance committee?  The Minister of State claims we can neither cancel nor defer the promissory notes.  That is not the case.  We could, for example, consider kicking the issue into the stands for 30 or 40 years.  We have options.  What we do not have is a Government that will negotiate on our behalf in an aggressive and determined manner.  Despite the strife and suffering in Greece, its Government may be achieving more than our own has done thus far.

I object to any proposal to subject the Irish people to that experience.  The people of this State will not be subjected to it as long as this Government is in place.  The question is how one negotiates.  Does one negotiate based on the Gaiety school of amateur acting, as we have just seen from the Deputy, or does one negotiate in a deliberate and calm way on what can be achieved?  This Government will not play with people's lives in the way in which the Deputy proposes.

We have achieved that by negotiation.  For a programme country to secure that type of concession is an extraordinary achievement.I reject what the Deputy said in regard to the interest rate reduction we achieved.  We were working to secure it for more than six months.  Papers were produced by the Government and when the Greek issue came to be resolved, the papers were there and the model was there.I am not excluding any option in regard to the promissory notes.  We are looking at all options.

To follow up on what Deputy Broughan said, is it not the case that the price the Greek Government has paid for its strategy is an intensification of austerity in the short to medium run and a further loss of sovereignty?  Greece is now in a situation where all of the power its finance department had has been conferred on a third party.  That is not a course of action open to this State nor is it one the Irish people would accept.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Is the Minister of State not concerned that three of the most prominent economists in the country, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, roundly refuted what he is saying about the promissory notes?  They said they did not see us getting back to the financial markets, that the State would need re-financing in 2014, that they did not believe there is any chance of our being in a position to get money on the international markets and that, therefore, we would be in second bail-out territory.  They also stated that if this happens the austerity now being imposed will pale into insignificance and will reach Greek proportions.  What does the Minister of State have to say in response to those economists who say something must be done about the €3.1 billion payments due every year on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Almost every Member of this House will accept that the previous Government in making the decisions it made in relation to Anglo Irish Bank was criminally misled by the bank about the scale of the losses it had on its books.  Deputy Twomey is correct that taking on this enormous burden has had spill-over affects across the European Union.The EFSF has been replaced with the ESM which has a mandate for recapitalising banks.  Given there was no such fund in place when the decisions were made in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, surely there is an exceptionally strong case for the Irish Government to press for those funds to be used in a cost effective manner to ease this burden.

If the promissory note did not exist our debt to GDP ratio would decrease, which would entice investment back to our country because it would then clearly be sustainable.  Will the Minister of State accept that the promissory note is being paid by this State to Anglo Irish Bank, which is an organ of the State, which then pays the money to another subsidiary of the State, namely, the Irish Central Bank which does nothing other than destroy it?

I reiterate that the news from the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, that we will have to pay the €3.1 billion at the end of March as no result will be achieved by then is bad news.  This means that we will continue to bear this burden in 2014 and 2015.  The Government does not appear determined enough to achieve anything in this area.  So far, it has done nothing.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I have not said whether it will be paid in March.  I have given no commitments in that regard.Deputy Donohoe raised an important issue.  Irrespective of the promissory note, the debt mountain facing this country is a considerable issue.  We owe slightly more than €180 billion, €140 billion of which relates to the difference between income and expenditure and €40 billion of which relates to banking.  If that was pulled tomorrow, we know the impact of the cuts on our people that would follow.  This is the situation which faces the Government on a daily basis.  It is responsible for ensuring the transition of managing the debt and looking for a fairer, restructured redesign on the promissory note which would allow us to grow the economy.I agree with Deputy McGrath's remarks in regard to the new ESM.  One of the issues that arose for discussion on Monday night, in respect of which I believe we will get agreement at the Council meeting on 1 March, is the new lending capacity.  Currently, the firewall stands at €500 billion.  People are talking about an increase of more than €250 billion, which would bring the total to €750 billion.  I do not suggest that will be the outcome between now and March.  However, as pointed out by Deputy McGrath, that would significantly advance our position.As I stated earlier, the markets are a little like the media in that they hunt in packs.  As long as the spotlight remains on Ireland investors will run away.  That is the reality.  We are a small open trading economy which does not have the colossal natural resources of others to determine whether we get funds into the country.  The crucial piece of the jigsaw is to get money into the Irish banks and to cut our umbilical cord with the ECB.  That is the crucial task we face.  Slowly but surely we are getting there.  In the final quarter of last year funds came back into the Irish banking sector.  Also, the exposure of Ireland to the ECB has decreased in recent quarters.  That is the type of deliberate process of confidence that this country needs to maintain.I did not make any disparaging comments about the Greek people.  I simply said-----

#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter, the importance of which is evident from the fact that four Deputies from County Kerry have tabled it for topical issue debate.I was angered by the decision of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to produce a report following a meeting in the Taoiseach's office in the week leading up to Christmas between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resource, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan and myself and Shannon LNG at which there was a lengthy discussion on what further steps could be taken to resolve this matter.  Two solutions were identified, including that the parties could sit down at a table and try to come up with a solution and investigation of whether the complaint made to the EU Commission could be suspended until such time as a consultation process had been concluded.  Unfortunately, neither happened.The report issued last week by the CER ultimately determines the framework upon which all further decisions on whether this project will go ahead will be made.  I come from a county and constituency which has enormous unemployment.  There has been much talk about export growth.  This project could result in more than $1 billion being brought into the country and the creation of approximately 700 jobs.  The McCarthy report, often condemned in this House, states that this would provide fuel security.  It further states that if we increase the supply of energy to the country it should be possible to lower the price.  I acknowledge the interconnector between Ireland and the UK, which supplies 95% of our gas at a cost of €50 million per annum.None of the solutions put forward suggest to me that this matter will be resolved soon.  This issue needs to be addressed in an open and transparent manner.  The date of 17 March was set as the deadline for finalisation of talks on this matter.  It is imperative that the regulator is brought before a committee of the Oireachtas to explain why he produced a report which prefixes a framework that could ultimately prevent this project going ahead.  It is essential that this matter is given urgent consideration as it could benefit north Kerry, the county and the country.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I agree entirely with the points made by my colleague, Deputy Spring.  The raising of this important matter by four Deputies who represent County Kerry demonstrates how critical it is.  The bottom line is that jobs are at stake.  A fantastic announcement was made yesterday on the creation of 1,000 jobs in County Louth through the establishment of PayPal.  This project is its north Kerry equivalent.  A total of 650 construction jobs are associated with the project and there would be a further 100 permanent jobs were it to proceed.  Millions of euro have already been invested in it and if it gets the go-ahead, up to €1 billion will be invested in the north Kerry economy.  It is a no-brainer and everything possible must be done to ensure it goes ahead.  I call on the Minister to take action and do everything in his power to ensure these jobs are created.  I emphasise that he must do everything in his power because one of the major barriers to the project has been the lack of regulatory certainty, which he can provide.As a Deputy representing County Kerry, I would be ashamed if the project were not to proceed.  Moreover, Members are not prepared to stand by and let it slip through their fingers because it is too important for those awaiting jobs who perceive it as a ray of hope.  Some 17,500 people are on the live register in the county and the project would help to reduce that number considerably.  It would alo provide a stimulus for the entire economy of north Kerry and west Limerick.  The Minister must, therefore, step up to the mark and do what he can to ensure the project gets the go-ahead and deliver a good news story for County Kerry.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	456	In conjunction with my colleagues from County Kerry, I have brought this brought to the Minister's attention in the hope he can resolve the outstanding matters.  As Deputies Spring and Griffin have stated, the project involves approximately 750 jobs, of which 650 would be created in the construction phase.  A further 100 permanent jobs would be created thereafter.Last Friday the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, published a draft recommendation on tariffs for gas interconnectors which would apply to companies such as Shannon LNG which states it will not use them.  A public consultation process is ongoing and at last Monday's meeting of Kerry County Council Mr. Paddy Power of Shannon LNG told the council that the move constituted a fundamental change in Government policy.  He stated it was akin to turning up at a football match only to be told one would be playing a game of hurling.  This issue must be resolved.  I suggest both the Minister and the Taoiseach meet all Deputies from the county as soon as possible.  County Kerry is one of the country's black spots; the North Kerry constituency has an unemployment rate of more than 26%.  Consequently, it is in urgent need of an input to try to create jobs as young people are being lost on a daily basis.  Current developments at Tarbert and Ballylongford are matters that can be resolved politically by a change of policy, if that is what it takes, to ensure jobs are attracted to that part of the county.I reiterate that I will work with my fellow Deputies, all of whom are wearing the Kerry jersey in this instance and the Irish jersey in respect of job creation.  It is essential that this matter be sorted out and if that requires the banging together of heads around the table, so be it.  However, matters must not be allowed to continue as they are.  The issue is limping on from week to week and there is no light at the end of the tunnel, only speculation.  Consequently, the matter must be resolved.  Were Members to work together politically, this could be done.  I again express my hope the Minister can arrange an urgent meeting with the Deputies from the constituency, as well as the Senators from County Kerry.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	457	This matter pertains to the huge investment proposed in the project mentioned - €600 million in the terminal and €400 million in the power plant.  At a time when we are trying to entice investment from throughout the world, it is mind-boggling that we are looking at a gift horse in the mouth and shying away from it in the form of this €1 billion investment.  As the other Deputies noted, the south-west corner of Ireland has been devastated by unemployment.  It certainly is a black spot that has been overlooked in many respects during the years by IDA Ireland in the main, as well as by the other job creation agencies.The saga of the Shannon and Tarbert land bank is ongoing and there have been many false dawns.  Several projects were proposed, but they fell apart and nothing of significance has taken place.  The project mentioned is the most feasible that has been put forward to date.  What is ironic is that the Government set out the rules in 2001, following a debate at the Cabinet, to comply with European Union gas directives and encourage new and secure sources of gas supplies in a free and open market with no obstacles attached.  Subsequently, however, the Commission for Energy Regulation made proposals that would result in a substantial proportion of the interconnection charges imposed on the direction of the energy regulator being levied on gas suppliers.  Consequently, suppliers such as Shannon LNG, Corrib and Kinsale Gas were greatly affected.  The Tarbert project certainly would take the main hit in this regard because the other probably have been exhausted.  Moreover, when reviewing the proposals made by the Commission for Energy Regulation, the economist Colm McCarthy concluded that they were not consistent with its cost-reducing remit on energy policy.  In other words, this meant they were bad for the householder, the consumer and business in general.  The Minister should intervene in this regard.  He has the power to so do and could issue a Government policy directive to turn things around and rescue the project because otherwise it will be lost.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I thank the four Deputies for again giving me the opportunity to address Members of the House on this important issue.  I have consistently welcomed the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Such a facility, together with the bringing onshore of Corrib gas, would provide important additional security in providing a gas supply for Ireland.  I met the promoters of the project soon after taking office last year and both my Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation are in regular contact with Shannon LNG.  Most recently, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, Deputy Spring and I met its representatives on 21 December.  The meeting offered a timely opportunity to review the state of play on the project and underline the Government's positive interest in the potential investment.The meeting also discussed the central concern of Shannon LNG, to obtain regulatory certainty at the earliest opportunity on future pricing and the treatment of Ireland's two gas interconnectors.  Together with all players and potential players in Ireland's gas market, Shannon LNG has a key commercial interest in the outcome of the regulator's ultimate decision on this highly complex regulatory question and given the complexities involved, there are many perspectives on what the decision should be.  The regulator has been engaged in an extensive consultation process on the matter for the last few months and has had considerable interaction with Shannon LNG, as well as with all key stakeholders.In line with the stated need for all interested parties, including Shannon LNG, to have clarity and certainty on the future regulatory regime as soon as possible, the regulator originally had signalled it would come to a decision last autumn.  Unfortunately, the process was delayed by Shannon LNG's own decision to lodge a number of complaints with the European Commission.This further delay in the process was discussed with Shannon LNG at the meeting on 21 December, as was Shannon LNG's own particular perspective on the regulatory issues for decision by CER.Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and tariffing are statutorily a matter for the CER under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no function in the matter.  As the independent energy regulator, the CER has a remit to protect energy consumers, to ensure security of supply and to support competitiveness.  It also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.I understand that on 17 February, the CER published a proposed decision paper - its normal way of going about something like this - on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors.  The regulator has announced that it intends to hold one further public forum for stakeholders on 1 March.  Given the multiplicity of perspectives on the matter, I am sure all stakeholders, including Shannon LNG, will welcome such a forum.  In tandem, stakeholders have the opportunity to respond to the regulator by 16 March on the matters raised in the proposed decision paper.   At the end of this period, the regulator will assess all comments received and publish a final decision.  I understand the regulator expects a final decision to be available by end April.   I would hope the regulator will improve on that date.  The regulator's final decision will bring the regulatory certainty which Shannon LNG has repeatedly sought.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I acknowledge that the forum on 1 March will be welcomed by Shannon LNG.  However, the mantra of this Government for the past 12 months is that we want to create jobs for our people and that we want to do everything in our power to make sure we reduce the unacceptable number of more than 400,000 people on the live register.  Quite frankly, there needs to be greater intervention by the Minister in this matter.  I do not feel it is good enough for him to come in here and tell us this is a matter for the energy regulator.  He needs to directly intervene in this and guarantee these jobs for north Kerry.This is a crucial matter for us.  We need certainty as does the company.  Our international reputation is at stake.  When a company has expressed so much interest in our country and has already invested so much money, the Government needs to welcome that interest and show of solidarity with the Irish people.  That is what I am asking the Minister to do.An increased supply on the market surely should be good for competition rather than bad for competition.  That is something that should be borne in mind.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I thank the Minister for his detailed response, but we have gone no further.  There is an impasse here and we have to find a way to break it.  The Minister mentioned Shannon LNG's own decision to lodge a number of complaints with the European Commission.  As I read the rest of his speech, that is not the reason for holding things up.  The proposal to have an opportunity to respond to the CER by 16 March is in the proposed decision paper.If the political will exists - there is collective political will from all parties in respect of job creation and from a parochial point of view in trying to get jobs into Kerry - this must be overcome.  Both the Minister and the Taoiseach have a role to play in this.  Much was said at that meeting last Monday.  I referred to a €75 million tariff.  Is that true or is it just wild speculation?  If that is the case, it will ensure it effectively will not happen.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I am in agreement with the Deputies.  There is an essential need for the Government to intervene.  I cannot see anything positive coming out of the process here, whereby stakeholders will make further submissions by 1 March.  We are going around the house and back to square one again.  The importance of this cannot be over-emphasised.  We are being told on a weekly basis about our high energy costs for attracting industry and maintaining businesses.  Our electricity costs are enormously high even to the householder when compared to the European average.Perhaps we need to look at EU legislation and regulations.  We need to circumvent this in some way, and that is what government is for.  We are here as elected representatives for our county, and this is one of the most essential matters that has come before the House in the past 12 months.  We should examine every avenue possible to find ways and means to overcome the impasse.  There is a huge responsibility on all of us to reach a resolution as soon as possible.  Time is of the essence and I ask the Minister and the Government to examine this.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I thank the Deputies and I share their concern to grow employment in Kerry.  However, Deputy Griffin is essentially asking me to ignore the statute, and the other Deputies seem to concur.  Perhaps the House should take greater care when passing a law like this, but the House passed the law and Deputy Griffin is asking me to break the law.  I cannot do that, but within the constraints imposed on me by the law, I have done everything that is humanly possible to mediate the earliest possible outcome to this issue.  We would have had an outcome, as promised by the regulator, last autumn.  However, for reasons that it explained at our meeting on 21 December, the company decided to appeal to Europe against a decision that was not yet made and as a result, disabled the issuing of a decision last autumn.At our meeting on 21 December, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Deputy Spring met with the promoters and the American representative.  They asked for a forum and they are getting a forum.  It is normal practice for the regulator to publish this kind of paper in advance.   Let the stakeholders go along to that forum for however long it lasts and let them effect the changes that are deemed sensible.Under the regulatory regime, once utilisation of the interconnector decreases due to new sources of supply, the price per unit of gas transported through the interconnector will increase.  Therefore, in addition to its consumer protection remit, the regulator also has a competitiveness and a security of supply remit.  Whatever regime is put in place for the interconnectors, it is important for all stakeholders that it should be fit for purpose.  In other words, there was a huge investment by the State in the interconnectors between here and the neighbouring island.  We cannot strand those assets.  They have to be remunerated.  The final sentence of the executive summary to the paper published by the regulator reads:The CER has concluded that the current regulatory treatment of the BGE gas interconnectors with GB will no longer be fit for purpose when new sources of gas come on stream.  [It is referring to the Corrib and to the LNG project in this regard]  If the system is unchanged, it will result in significantly higher gas tariffs to all gas customers, and will distort efficient economic signals for the future use of the transmission system.It is the job of the CER to address such issues.  It is the task of LNG and other interested parties to attend the forum and influence the ultimate decision.  The CER has produced a draft decision, that is all.I understand the concern that exists in Kerry with regard to jobs.  Interest in this issue is whipped up every so often.  I assure the Deputies that there is no lack of engagement in respect of this matter.  I have pushed the law to the boundaries.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, and Deputies Spring, Griffin, Martin Ferris and Tom Fleming are all interested in this matter.  I understand that but I am constrained with regard to how far I can go.  I hope that on this occasion the regulator will be permitted to do its job and bring the issue to finality.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I wish to commend the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains on the work it has been doing.  It has had a number of specific successes but a total of seven bodies have not been found.  These are the bodies of people who were callously murdered by different paramilitary organisations.I wish to outline the reason why I raise this matter.  Time is running out for many of the families which have an expectation of locating the remains of their loved ones.  It is my intention to create an awareness of this issue and to send out a strong message to those who are in possession of information or who have access to such information.  These individuals they should search their consciences in the context of deciding whether they should make this information available.I want to place this matter in context.  I live on the coast of Donegal and a large number of people in my constituency are involved in the fishing industry.  During my lifetime, many individuals involved in that industry have tragically been lost at sea.  The consolation to people who live in fishing communities comes when the body of someone who has been lost is recovered.  That is a powerful consolation.  I recall attending a wake on one occasion at which a grandmother repeatedly stated "At least we found the body, there is consolation in that".  The position is no different for those who ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago lost loved ones as a result of the Troubles.  They know that their sons' or daughters' bodies are buried in the ground somewhere but they are not aware of the specific location.  However, they do not know whether they will ever find their loved ones during their own lifetimes.  In that context, I call on those with information to consult their consciences in respect of this matter and to take action in order to ensure that the people who have been trying to locate the bodies to which I refer will have some peace.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I thank Deputy McHugh for raising this important matter.  The conflict in Northern Ireland, which dominated politics in both jurisdictions on this island for decades, was sadly characterised by a savagery that never lost its potential to shock us.  Thousands lost their lives to violence and many thousands more - the families and friends of those victims of violence - were left to grieve, their lives having been changed forever.During the conflict in Northern Ireland a number of people were abducted and murdered by paramilitary groups and then buried in secret locations.  They have become known as "the Disappeared".  The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1999 as one element of a matrix of actions taken in the context of the peace process to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation.  The sole purpose of the commission is to facilitate the location of the remains of the Disappeared.  It has no role in criminal investigations or prosecutions.I had the opportunity in November last to meet with some of the families of the Disappeared.  They have suffered a very particular cruelty in not only being obliged to bear the tragedy of murder but also in having been denied, for so long, information regarding the burial places of their loved ones.  One can only imagine the anguish that these families have been forced to endure over past decades and that some of them still endure to this day.  I was struck by their dignity and bravery.  They have maintained their hope and resolve for decades and in the face of disappointments.  They continue to support one another in their determination to ensure that those still missing are recovered.  The Government fully supports them in this.  The Northern Ireland Office Minister, Mr. Hugo Swire MP, and the two commissioners, Mr. Frank Murray and Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, were also present at the meeting with the families.  We were happy to reassure the families that the commission will continue to do whatever it can to recover their loved ones.The commission, with the support of the two Governments, has worked tirelessly over the years.  I pay tribute to Frank Murray and Ken Bloomfield, and to their investigation team, for their sterling work in what is a very difficult and delicate task.  Thankfully, the commission has been able to bring closure for some of the families.  Regrettably, there are still seven people on the commission's list who, despite its efforts, have not been located.  The commission's current programme of work, based on the information about the possible location of one of the victims, will result in some further excavation works later this spring.  The commissioners have emphasised to me that their work is driven by information.  I know they made this clear at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement last week.  Without that key resource of information, there is little for the commission to go on.  I join Deputy McHugh in calling on anybody, whether they are within or without the republican movement, who has any information which could help locate those still missing to give that it to the commission without delay.  I make that call to people who live on this island or who reside elsewhere to provide any information of which they are aware and which could be of help.  All information provided to the commission will be treated as strictly confidential and everyone can rest assured that it can only be used to locate and identify the remains.  It cannot be given to other agencies, used for prosecutions etc.The commission has in place a confidential freephone number and post office box address through which information can be passed to it.  Information about the commission and how to contact it is available on the its website, www.iclvr.ie.  The commission’s sole purpose is a humanitarian one.  All the families want is to give their loved ones a decent burial, to have a place to grieve and, in some measure at least, to obtain closure.  The Government remains committed to that aim and I call on all others to help bring it about.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The Minister said everything that needs to be said.  I echo his call that information be provided.  We must send out a strong signal on the importance of this matter to the families.  Unfortunately we may not have success for all seven families, but even a percentage increase would be significant.  I echo the Minister's comments and concur with him on the efforts of everybody in the commission.  It is a question of conscience.  People will be grappling with their consciences in bed at night.  That is the time to think about it and I ask them to do so.  Everything will be treated in the strictest confidence, as the Minister outlined.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I will briefly respond.  People have suffered terrible unexpected tragedy in their lives during the course of what occurred on this island during the terrible years of violence and conflict.  Families are entitled to know the whereabouts of the remains of their loved ones, they are entitled to have the opportunity for a burial service, and they are entitled to some closure, in so far as it is ever possible to bring it about.There are people on this island who must know the whereabouts of some of the remains that have yet to be recovered and who, for reasons known only to themselves, are not yet willing to share this information.  I call on them to do so, and not only on behalf of the Government because, in saying this, I think I represent all Members of the House, be they members of parties or independent.One final effort would be a huge help to these families.  For the commission to engage in this effort, it requires information.  Its work is essentially dependent on information being made available to it.  If people on the island were involved in terrible acts in the past and know the whereabouts of the remains of those who lost their lives, they should make some small acknowledgement of their role in this by quietly and confidentially providing essential information to facilitate the commission continue its work and afford new hope to the families who today anxiously await the possibility of remains being located and returned, and the possibility of a proper decent burial service for their loved ones.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for providing me with the opportunity to debate this issue and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, for coming to the Chamber to respond to the debate.I very much welcome the recent announcement by the Department and the Minister that under new procedures, a medical card will remain valid, irrespective of the expiry date on the card, once the medical card holder is genuinely engaging with the HSE review process.  Given the long delays in processing medical card applications, this should bring some relief to applicants, especially renewal applicants who have been turned down and feel they have strong grounds for appeal.Under the new procedure, as Members may be aware, while an appeal is being processed the claimant should be able to present the existing card to a doctor or pharmacist who can check the validity of it on the website www.medicalcard.ie.  If a person’s card is under review, the person presents it to a pharmacist or GP who goes online and sees the card is under review, and the person remains in the system.  However, therein lies the problem.I will take the example of one of my constituents who had been engaged in the review process.  This person had been granted a full medical card for more than a decade but on review was issued a GP visit card.  When this decision was being appealed, it was discovered, during a visit to a pharmacist, that the person had been locked out of the system.  The difficulty then arose of having to meet medication costs while locked out of the system.The appeal process cannot be seen online.  When the medical card was checked online, it should have shown the card was under review, but it showed a GP visit card had been granted.  A technological system which is supposed to be more efficient is causing a problem.  For the new procedure to work the medical card database must be up to date and must be cognisant of the appeals process.  My office has tested this.  I do not claim the examination was scientific but we entered a selection of valid GP visit and full medical cards and drug payment scheme cards, none of which was recognised by the system.  There is a technical difficulty.  In bringing the matter before the House I ask the Minister of State to examine it and explore how the difficulty can be surmounted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this issue.  I am very conscious of the fact there have been serious difficulties and delays in processing applications, renewals and appeals of medical cards.  I have been in ongoing discussions with the HSE in recent months to ensure the level of service provided to the public is brought up to an acceptable level because what is happening at present is not acceptable.I wish to clarify a number of developments that have taken place in recent weeks and months which should improve the situation.  Any medical card holder undergoing a review for a renewed card who genuinely engages with the HSE in this review will retain entitlement to a medical card until such time as the HSE decides on the outcome of the review.  This new procedure applies to individuals regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.The eligibility of all standard medical cards for people under 66 years of age has been extended to three years, and to four years for people aged 66 years and over.  A self-assessment review process is now in place for all standard renewals for all clients, regardless of age.  Discretionary cards, emergency cards and cards held by people in a small number of other categories will continue to be reviewed in the normal way.  A fast-track decision process and the associated technical changes have been put in place to deal with urgent review cases.  In addition to these changes to the processes for medical card applications, 20 additional staff were redeployed to the central office in January to bring its complement to 150 people.  I hope this will help improve the level of service.I know Deputy Lynch is particularly concerned about medical card appeals.  It is HSE policy that a person's eligibility is maintained while the outcome of an appeal is awaited.  I will ask the HSE to ensure immediately that this policy is applied in respect of the case the Deputy highlighted and to ensure adequate procedures are in place to prevent mistakes such as this occurring in future.  I will engage further with the HSE on the points raised by the Deputy in respect of the website www.medicalcard.ie.  I have taken note of the points he has made and I heard a similar complaint recently.On the broader issue of appeals, I have had very constructive engagement with the HSE in recent weeks on addressing the backlog in medical card appeals.  Extra staffing resources have been deployed in this area in recent weeks.  The backlog in appeals is being reduced.  In recent weeks more than 500 files have been cleared.  I expect progress will continue to be made.  Senior staff in the Department have assured me they are targeting the end of April as the date by which most of the backlog should be addressed.  I have asked for regular updates on progress in this regard.  I am very hopeful we will see significant improvement in the coming weeks.  I accept fully what Members have been saying about this.  The current level of service has not been acceptable.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.

I acknowledge the categorical statement made that people whose cards are under review are entitled to be provided with treatment under their previous qualification.  We have a systems rather than a policy difficulty here.  The policy is correct but the systems difficulty must be sorted.  I appreciate the Minister of State's response in dealing with this matter in a speedy fashion today.I have a supplementary question.  One of the initial stages in the proposed roll-out of a universal health care programme as laid out in the programme for Government is the provision of doctor-only medical cards for patients with long-term illness.  This is a similar sort of process in that it broadens the qualification process for the medical cards.  Will the Minister of State tell me how that part of the universal health care programme is developing?

As the Deputy noted, the programme for Government commits to introducing free GP care during the lifetime of this Government.  The first phase will be introduced shortly, bringing all existing claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme to free GP care under that initiative.  That requires primary legislation although the Bill is short and straightforward.  Work on it is well under way at this point and we hope to bring a memo to Government within the next few weeks, with the legislation to follow.  I will seek to have that legislation taken as quickly as possible through both Houses.  There is a backlog of Bills stacked up, including a number of health Bills, but I will seek to get this legislation through as soon as possible.  I hope that first cohort of people will be brought into the free GP care initiative in the early summer.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this very important issue and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Ciaran Cannon. Through parliamentary questions and a Fianna Fáil Private Members’ motion I had the opportunity to outline our concerns about the adverse effects the proposed changes to staffing schedules for small schools will cause to many communities throughout the country.  This issue is not confined to rural Ireland but is also a concern for some communities in urban areas.I welcome that the Minister has  included an appeals mechanism in respect of staffing schedules for small schools with effect from next September, and that the element of retrospection is removed.  However, I understand from the circular that although this part of the retrospection element has been removed actual enrolment numbers for September 2012 have been increased.  My understanding is that a school that formerly needed 49 pupils for a third teacher appointment will need to have 53 pupils enrolled in September 2012 to retain a teaching complement of three.  The required higher number of pupils is a further cause of concern.  Is there provision to take into account an individual school's circumstances?The Minister's predecessor commenced a value-for-money review of the role of small primary schools which was intended to find out the best way of supporting such schools.  Small schools should be valued and protected.  The extent of the current concern is due to the unusually high number of primary schools we have in proportion to our population.  This is the result of many factors, the most important of which is that our national schools have always played a focal point in the local community.  Our population patterns and dispersal are very different to those of most European countries.In terms of education standards the evidence is that pupil outcomes in smaller schools keep pace with those of schools that have much larger enrolment and specialised support services.  Happily, in the past ten to 12 years we have had a major investment in our smaller schools in human and physical resources.  In the overall context the money involved has been a tiny fraction of the State's spending but the impact has been enormous, positive and progressive.I pointed out that 47% of the 3,200 primary schools in the State have five teachers or fewer and consequently it is evident what a huge impact the staffing schedule changes would have on small rural schools.  We all accept that small schools tend to have a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio than larger schools.  It is important that we bear in mind that teachers in small schools have pupils of different ages and different grades in their classrooms and this adds to the complexity of multi-grade teaching.The proposed cuts will have a disproportionate and severe impact on minority faith schools such as Church of Ireland schools of which there is a sizeable number in my  constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, as well as in County Donegal, the general Border region and elsewhere.  Those communities are very concerned about the proposed changes and the future viability of their schools.  Minority faith schools have experienced a comprehensive rationalisation during recent decades.  If some of these schools close, for reasons of distance it will be practically impossible for some children to attend school under the patronage of one of the minority churches.  Many of the clergy, teachers and parents involved in minority faith schools are extremely worried about the future of their schools and are extremely disappointed with the changes being introduced by the Minister.This action flies in the face of the Minister's stated policy.  What does this policy do for school patronage and choice?  These changes are blunt in nature and force cuts based on numbers alone, without any consideration of a school's ethos, the geography of a particular area or the impact on the community of removing such a key amenity.  In most areas such schools have been the beneficiary of good parental and community involvement.  In addition to the potential effects on schools under the patronage of minority churches there will be a severe impact on Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna.  I outlined this point clearly in our Private Members' motion.Why are such important decisions being made in advance of the value-for-money review?  This should be finalised and in the public domain at an early date.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister and his Department to advise small schools to consider their future and assess their options for amalgamation.  The clear message is, "Talk among yourselves".  This leads to uncertainty and doubt which are not in the interests of any school or any institution.We all realise there can be a fluctuation in enrolments from year to year depending on the number leaving sixth class and the new intake.  It is not easy for schools to prove likely enrolment for future years, particularly when the numbers are small.  The enrolment of one or two pupils can be critically important in small schools.  I appeal to the Government to recognise the importance of our small schools.  That importance must be given due recognition.  Unfortunately, the uncertainty has not been removed with the detail of the appeals mechanism.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the expansion to the staffing appeal process to include small schools affected by the recent budget measure.Budget 2012 provided for phased increases in the pupil thresholds for the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers in small primary schools.  This affects schools with enrolment of fewer than 86 pupils.  The first of these phased increases in the pupil thresholds takes effect from September 2012.  Out of an overall total of almost 1,200 small primary schools it is envisaged that marginally more than 73 schools will lose a mainstream classroom teacher in September 2012 as a direct result of the impact of the budget measure.  The final number of such schools will become clearer as the teacher allocation process is progressed.The existing staffing appeals process is being expanded to be accessible to those small schools which are due to lose a classroom post as a direct result of the budget measure.  Such schools will be able to submit an appeal to the independent staffing appeals board on the basis that it is projecting increased enrolment in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow it to retain its existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements for this are set out in the Department's staffing circular which was published yesterday on the Department's website.  The first meeting of the staffing appeals board will be held in April.  Small schools that are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 should submit their appeals to it on or before Friday, 23 March 2012.  The outcome of appeals will be notified to schools as soon as possible after the meeting of the staffing appeals board in April.This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.School communities should have no reason to feel that there will be a forced closure or amalgamation of their local school.  A school does not close because it loses a teacher; schools close because of a loss of pupils.  Small primary schools that have had to close in recent years are those that are no longer viable due to falling enrolments.  The enrolment in such schools had typically fallen below a total of eight pupils for two consecutive school years.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I thank the Minister of State for his reply but, unfortunately, it does not convey any assurance to schools under the patronage of minority faiths, schools in Gaeltacht areas or gaelscoileanna.  I emphasise that this does not affect only rural schools.  I met teachers and members of boards of management of schools in Dublin who are fearful for the future.I welcome the extension of the appeals mechanism to cover small schools.  Can individual school circumstances be taken into account?  The uncertainty and doubt about the viability of a number of small schools has not been allayed by the Minister's decision and the detail provided regarding the appeals mechanism.  I read the circular on the Department's website last night.  It was starkly clear that the increased enrolment necessary next September will pose further difficulties for some schools.  That is not the understanding I took from replies the Minister gave to parliamentary questions in the House previously.  I instanced a school that needed an enrolment of 49 pupils to have a three teacher complement last September, which will need an enrolment of 53 pupils next September to maintain that complement.  It is not easy to increase enrolment by that number in a small area, given that enrolments fluctuate.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Unfortunately, the budgetary and academic years do not coincide and anomalous cases always arise when a change is made to the pupil-teacher ratio in the middle of the academic year.  This is not unusual and it happened in the past when previous Governments implemented changes to the pupil-teacher ratio.  The number of pupils required for retention of a teacher was increased and the Department used the numbers enrolled the previous September to work out the posts that would be retained or lost the following September.The appeals process sets out deliberately to resolve the anomaly that has arisen from the recent budgetary change.  Such concession has not been available to schools in the past and I am glad it will be from now on.  Minority faith schools, gaelscoileanna and schools in Gaeltacht areas will also have access to the new appeals process.  It sets out to address the potential anomaly whereby we might have removed a teaching post from a school only to find that the pupil numbers dictated that the post would have to be reinstated the following year.  The process will take that into account and if a school is experiencing an upward trend in enrolment, it should have no fears about losing posts.  It is, however, important to realise that if schools are showing a static or downward trend in enrolment, it will be difficult to make the case to sustain teaching posts in that instance.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I move amendment No. 27:
In page 20, after line 24, to insert the following:"26.—In the event of an agency worker being denied access to amenities or facilities to which he or she is entitled a minimum compensation of €1,000, increasing in line with the Consumer Price Index, shall apply in addition to an order compelling the employer to give such access."The amendment was tabled in conjunction with the previous amendment to tighten up the legislation and to ensure clear penalties are imposed if an agency worker is denied access to amenities or facilities to which he or she entitled.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure agencies and employers comply with the legislation and to impose a penalty if workers are denied access.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21528	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I thank the Deputy for the amendment.  Schedule 2 provides for the avenue of legal recourse that an agency worker can take in the event of being denied, among other things, access to amenities and facilities.  It is up to the Rights Commissioner Service to determine the appropriate compensation to be awarded, given the set of circumstances that present.  It would be inappropriate, given the powers of the Rights Commissioner, to provide for minimum awards in certain instances without knowing the circumstances in which they arise.  I do not propose to accept the amendment for this reason.Generally, Rights Commissioners have the power to make awards that are just and equitable in all circumstances and the awards can be of up to two years remuneration.  They have considerable discretion, therefore, in making awards.  Seeking to impose minimum fines without knowing the circumstances would not be fair or appropriate.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	477	We discussed this issue earlier and we recognised the fact that it takes almost a year and a half to have a case heard by a Rights Commissioner.  A penalty such as this would deter employers from denying workers access to their amenities and facilities and I would like the amendment to be accepted.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to open the debate in the Dáil on the Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Bill 2012.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences contained in the financial resolution on motor tax passed by the Dáil on budget day, 6 December 2011.The new rates apply to motor tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.  The Bill provides for the same increases in motor tax as contained in the financial resolution, namely an increase of 7.5% applied across most categories of vehicle and to trade licences.  As set out in the financial resolution, there was an exception for private vehicles in the lower CO2 bands A to C with higher flat rate increases.  Band A rises from €104 to €160, Band B rises from €156 to €225 and Band C rises from €302 to €330.  It is anticipated that the proposed increases in motor tax rates will raise some €46.5 million extra in respect of 2012.As announced in the budget, broader or longer-term changes to the motor taxation system are to be considered as part of the review of the carbon banding of VRT and motor tax currently under way.  This review is being carried out jointly by the Minister for Finance and by myself as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is my intention that the twin priorities of ensuring the protection of the tax base and revenues under both headings and the positive environmental impact of the existing basis of taxation will be carried through to the future.  A consultation paper is available on the Department of Finance website and the closing date for submissions is 1 March next.While the levels of increase announced for the lower CO2 bands are higher in percentage terms than the rest of the fleet, they must be viewed against a structure that left the bottom rates very low.  It is also important to note that the underlying structure of the banding system has not been changed, and there remains a positive incentive to purchase low CO2 cars.It also must be remembered that, while the introduction of the CO2 bands was designed to encourage a switch to lower emission vehicles, the changes were introduced on a second principle of revenue neutrality.  It has always been the intention that the motor taxation system is kept under review to ensure that it meets these twin objectives over the years.  The reality is that there has been a significant loss of motor tax income over recent years as the number of vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2 emissions has increased by about 5% year on year.  At the end of January 2012, the CO2 fleet of cars comprised 18.8% of all cars on the road.  Of these, more than 315,000, representing 89% of the CO2 fleet, are taxed at the three lowest bands.  While this is very welcome from an environmental perspective, it has represented an increasing loss to the local government fund.Receipts have been reduced from €1.06 billion in 2008 to €1.01 billion last year.  Following the budget, the average motor tax payment for vehicles in the CO2 system is €274.  For those taxed on engine capacity, the average payment is €478.  Once the older cars are all replaced by cars taxed on the basis of CO2 over the next 15 years or so, it is estimated that total motor tax from cars will fall by more than 40%.  In the current economic circumstances and given the need to maintain a diversified and stable taxation system, this loss of income represents an opportunity cost that must be rectified.Deputies will be aware of the significant role that the local government fund has played in the financing of local government since it was established in 1999.  The fund has hitherto been financed from a combination of an Exchequer contribution and the full proceeds of motor taxation.  However, in this instance, the increase in income from the proposed rate increases will be transferred to the Exchequer.  This is a necessary measure towards the reduction of the national debt.  The wording of an amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 to allow for the legislative underpinning of such a transfer is close to finalisation and I will introduce an additional section to the Bill on Committee Stage.Exchequer funding of local authorities' day-to-day activities cannot be immune as part of the effort to close the gap between income and expenditure in the public finances, and the Members will already be aware that the 2012 Exchequer allocation to local government has been reduced by €164 million compared with 2011.  However, I stress that the Government is committed to supporting the local government fund and it will retain the income from the existing rates of motor tax.  The establishment of the local government fund and its funding, in part, from motor tax receipts has created an important link between the amount of tax paid by motorists and the visible and concrete service they get for that tax in terms of better roads.  An amount of €404.7 million has been allocated to the Department of Transport from the local government fund for 2012 for roads and public transport infrastructure.Turning to the provisions of the Bill, it contains six sections and a Schedule.  Section 1 and section 6 are procedural.  Section 2 sets out that the rates apply to licences taken out for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2012.  Section 3 provides for the Schedule to the Bill, which contains the new rates, to replace the existing Schedule in motor tax legislation.  Section 4 provides for the increase to apply to vintage or veteran vehicles.  It also contains a minor amendment to the definition of "CO2 emissions".  Section 5 provides for the increases that apply to trade plates and replacement trade plates.  The Schedule sets out the new annual motor tax rates for all other vehicles.I would like to highlight to the House what the new tax rates means in real cash terms in regard to private cars and goods vehicles which make up over 91% of the national fleet.  For private cars taxed on the basis of engine size, the extra cost will be between €13 and €35 a year for vehicles up to 1,700 cc.  This relates to 68% of all cars taxed on engine capacity.  For cars up to 2.5 litres the annual increases will be from €41 to €70 and from 2.5 litres upwards, which account for 2.5% of the engine capacity fleet, an additional €84 to €117 per year.  For vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2, the D to G bands increase by between €34 and €158 per year.  For cars in Band A, which account for 26.1% of the CO2 car fleet, the annual rate increase is €56, from €104 to €160.  For cars in band B, which account for 45.7% of the CO2 car fleet, the annual rate increase is €69, from €156 to €225.  For cars in band C, which account for 16.9% of the CO2 car fleet, the annual rate increase is €28, from €302 to €330.  Again, I  must stress that these increases apply to rates that were set at very low levels.For goods vehicles, the effect of the 7.5% increase will vary depending on the size of the vehicle in weight terms,.  Some 90% of vehicles in this category are at the lowest level of charge, meaning that they will pay €310, representing an annual increase of €13 or 25 cent per week.The vehicles that make up the remainder of the national fleet consist mainly of agricultural vehicles, motorcycles, vintage vehicles and small public service vehicles.  All these vehicles have a separate tax class with a concessionary rate of tax on or under €95 after the increase of 7.5% has been applied.A 7.5% increase is also proposed for trade licences, or trade plates as they are known.  These are the registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles, which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles.  While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates, they are transferable between vehicles.  The increase for a pair of trade plates will be €23 per annum.Three minor technical amendments are also contained in the Bill.  Section 4 contains a minor technical change to relate the definition of "CO2 emissions" directly to the Finance Acts definition used for VRT purposes.  The amendment in this Bill means that all the relevant definitions are common to both motor tax and VRT and ensures uniformity across both tax systems.Part 4 of the Schedule provides for an amended definition of motor caravan.  Between 1998, when a concessionary rate for motor caravans was first introduced, and 2010, the same definitions applied for VRT and motor tax purposes.  The Finance Act 2010 amended the definition of motor caravan for VRT purposes to ensure conformity with an EU definition.  This is the first opportunity to make a parallel amendment to the Finance (Excise Duties)(Vehicles) Act 1952 to apply the same definition for motor tax purposes.  Different definitions for VRT and motor tax purposes give rise to potential confusion and the possibility of different regimes for the same vehicle under both codes.The final amendment relates to the change in classification of passenger vehicles from category A to the EU-defined category M1.  This is contained in part 6(g) of the Schedule.  A provision was introduced in the Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) (No. 2) Act 2008 to provide that passenger vehicles registered elsewhere in the first half of 2008 and subsequently registered in the State were eligible for taxation on the basis of CO2 emissions.  Passenger vehicles were classified as category A vehicles at the time.From 1 January 2011, the Revenue Commissioners introduced a revised vehicle categorisation system for VRT purposes.  The revised system reflects the categories used for the classification of vehicles at European level, as set out under a number of EC directives, including those relating to the type approval of passenger vehicles.  Where a new or used vehicle is being registered in the State, use of an EU vehicle classification is now mandatory.  The amendment to the Schedule reflects the current VRT EU classification for motor vehicles.  The EU classification is equivalent to the pre-2011 Revenue VRT category, that is, EU classification M1 is normally equivalent to Revenue category A passenger vehicles and accordingly liability for motor tax will remain unchanged.  Again, the purpose is to ensure uniformity between the tax codes and consistency of treatment of vehicles.I will be proposing a further section to the Bill on Committee Stage intended to ensure that vehicles registered in the first half of 2008 are fixed on one system of charging for motor tax, that is, either on the basis of engine capacity or on the basis of carbon emissions, as applied to each vehicle type in the period from 2008 to budget 2012.The background is as follows.  The Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Act 2008 introduced the system of motor taxation based on the CO2 emissions for private cars registered from 1 July 2008.  It also inserted a provision, in paragraph (6)(f) of Part 1 of the Schedule, that new cars registered between January and June 2008 shall pay motor tax on the basis of CO2 emissions from 1 July 2008, where the CO2 rate would have been lower had the relevant provisions applied.  This was a concession to purchasers of vehicles in the first half of the year to allow them benefit from the generally lower rates of motor tax based on CO2 emissions.Using different wording, a similar provision was subsequently made in the Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) (No. 2) Act 2008 so that imports first registered outside the State between 1 January and 30 June 2008 could avail of the lower of the two rates.  This is laid out in paragraph (6)(g) of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) (No. 2) Act 2008.The first increase in rates since that time was in budget 2012.  The approach taken in Financial Resolution No. 2 was to replicate the provisions of the legislation generally, including paragraphs (6)(f) and (6)(g) in respect of vehicles first registered between January and June 2008, and to list the increased rates of tax against each category of vehicle.  This has had an unintended consequence for the rates that apply to a small number of vehicles first registered outside the State between January and June 2008, mainly those in CO2 band B, with an engine capacity of less than 1,000 cc.  Hitherto, the CO2 band B rate was lower than the engine capacity rate, at €156 annually as opposed to €172.  Following the increase, the CO2 rate is €225, whereas the current engine capacity rate is €185; post-budget, the CO2 rate is now €40 higher, rather than €16 lower as it was pre-budget.When this inadvertent effect became evident over the Christmas period, refunds were made to two owners who had already paid at the incorrect rate.  Arrangements were also made to switch affected vehicles due to be taxed to the engine capacity rate, and this is currently being done on a month-by-month basis.  It is estimated that over the course of the year, some 67 vehicles in total are involved.There is now an inequity in the system whereby a particular group of vehicles, i.e. the specific cohort of second-hand imports referred to above, are switched to the lower of the two applicable rates as changes to motor tax rates occur.  At present, a very small group of vehicles is affected; however, as rates are likely to change over the coming years, including as a result of the current review of VRT and motor tax, there is potential for a greater number of vehicles to fall to be switched back and forth between the two systems of taxation.  This was never the intention when CO2 taxation was introduced in 2008, and aside from potentially increasing inequity in the treatment of taxpayers, it would be administratively very difficult to manage and explain.  I intend to ensure that the taxation structure that applied immediately pre-budget will continue into the future for affected vehicles.There is also the potential for alternative interpretations to be taken from the wording of the provisions relating to vehicles registered in the State in the first half of 2008.  This is interpreted, as intended, that vehicles remain in the taxation structure applied to them in respect of licences taken out after 1 July 2008.  However, the wording of the provision is such that it is also potentially possible to interpret it as meaning that the CO2 rate should be paid only where it is less than the prevailing cubic capacity rate for the vehicle.  Again, it was never the intention, on the introduction of the 2008 Act, that such vehicles would be able to flip back and forth depending on which basis of taxation was more favourable at a particular time.  Rather, the intention was that such vehicles would move permanently to the CO2 system of taxation.  I see no equitable justification for treating vehicles registered in the first six months of 2008 more favourably than all other vehicles.  Accordingly, I will be proposing on Committee Stage to provide that vehicles first registered outside the State in the first six months of 2008 will, from the date of enactment of the Bill, be fixed on whichever of the two charging systems (CO2 or engine capacity) applied to them prior to the recent rate increases.  I will also propose, for the avoidance of doubt, to provide that vehicles first registered in the State between January and June 2008 are also fixed on whichever of the charging systems applied prior to the rate increases.  This provides equity with respect to all other vehicles registered after 1 July 2008, for which owners have no choice in the matter but are locked into the CO2 system.In summary, this is a short Bill with the purpose of giving permanent legal standing to the increases in motor tax introduced by the Financial Resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 6 December 2011.  I commend it to the House.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	482	This Bill is a breach of trust for motorists who purchased environmentally friendly cars since 2008.  The financial incentives established in July 2008 to encourage drivers to switch to fuel-efficient cars with low CO2 emissions was a core feature of efforts to tackle climate change.  This Bill erodes the progress made on placing environmental concerns at the heart of public policy.  It penalises those motorists who took the decision to use environmentally friendly cars by shifting the goalposts in the middle of the game.  It sets a deeply unfortunate precedent of backtracking on efforts to tackle climate change.The Bill gives a permanent legislative basis to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences contained in the December budget.  The Bill increases the motor tax rates for vehicles in CO2 bands A and B by 54% and 44%, respectively.  For all other vehicles, except for certain exempted vehicles, and trade plate licences, the increase is 7.5%.  This is the first increase in motor tax since 2008 and has been in effect since 1 January 2012.  These increases are expected to yield an additional €46.5 million yearly.  The choice to buy clean and green has been hit with €56 and €69 fees.  These costs will be disproportionately borne by those motorists who in good faith availed of incentives to buy low CO2 emission vehicles.This specific targeting of environmentally friendly cars is a regressive move by the Government that cannot be defended on purely revenue-based grounds.  In our pre-budget submission we recommended a 5% rise in motor tax across the board, which does not rescind the environmental platform that Fianna Fáil built up while in Government.Given the clear disregard for environmental concerns that underpinned this decision, it is worth looking back on the issues that originally led to the creation of incentives for low CO2 emission cars.  The pressing global challenge of climate change is the backdrop to our efforts to encourage environmentally friendly driving.  The comprehensive Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, published in 2006, points out the grave threats that climate change represents and the action we need to take to rise to this challenge.  We should reflect upon the threats the Stern review sets out, which are as follows: all countries will be affected by climate change, but the poorest countries will suffer earliest and most; average temperatures could rise by 5°C from pre-industrial levels if climate change goes unchecked; warming of 3°C or 4°C will result in flooding for many millions of people; by the middle of the century, 200 million may be permanently displaced due to rising sea levels, heavier floods and drought; and warming of 4°C or more is likely to affect global food production seriously, while warming of 2°C could leave between 15% and 40% of species facing extinction.  Before the Industrial Revolution the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million CO2 equivalent; the current level is 430 ppm CO2 equivalent.  The level should be limited to between 450 ppm and 550 ppm CO2 equivalent, as anything higher would substantially increase the risk of very harmful impacts, while anything lower would impose very high adjustment costs in the near term and might not even be feasible.  Climate change is the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen.Those are the threats that we face.  The report points to a number of actions that need to be taken.  Three elements of policy are required for an effective response: carbon pricing, technology policy and energy efficiency.  Carbon pricing, through taxation, emissions trading or regulation, will show people the full social costs of their actions.  The aim should be a global carbon price across countries and sectors.  Emissions trading schemes such as that operating across the EU should be expanded and linked.  Technology policy should drive the large-scale development and use of a range of low-carbon and high-efficiency products.  The economic and quality-of-life issues raised by climate change are stark, and the benefits of strong, early action considerably outweigh the costs.  Unabated climate change could cost the world at least 5% of GDP each year; if more dramatic predictions come to pass, the cost could be more than 20% of GDP.  The cost of reducing emissions could be limited to around 1% of global GDP, with people being charged more for carbon-intensive goods.  Each tonne of CO2 we emit causes damage worth at least $85, but emissions can be cut at a cost of less than $25 per tonne.  Shifting the world onto a low-carbon path could eventually benefit the worldwide economy by $2.5 trillion per year.  What we do now can have only a limited effect on the climate over the next 40 or 50 years, but what we do in the next ten to 20 years could have a profound effect on climate in the second half of this century.This major global challenge is the backdrop to the Government's decision in 2008 to encourage the use of environmentally friendly cars.  It was part of holistic efforts to ensure Ireland fulfilled its duty and obligation to tackle global warming.  The Government's decision to reverse this progress, betray environmentally conscious motorists and delay publication of a climate change Bill until 2013 indicates a failure to appreciate the gravity of the crisis and take action to tackle the core causes.The decision to incentivise low CO2 emission vehicles is having a real impact on Ireland's efforts to contribute to tackling climate change.  A total of 88% of new vehicles since 2008 have been purchased in the A to C bands as motorists have responded to the incentives, switching from high emission cars to low CO2 emission vehicles.  This switch was made on the basis of the financial incentives provided, but the Government is now jeopardising that progress.Last year the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published provisional estimates of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2010.  In 2010 emissions from transport accounted for 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions.  After 2007 there was a clear drop-off in the level of emissions from transport which coincided with the switch from taxation based on engine size to CO2 emissions for new cars.  In the three years from 2008 to the end of 2010 emissions from transport declined by a cumulative 18%.  While there are other factors at play such as the recession, the EPA has stated "changes to vehicle registration tax and road tax introduced in mid-2008" is having an effect on emissions reductions.  Rescinding the motor tax incentives and making environmentally conscious motorists bear the burden of tax increases will damage the steady progress Ireland has made in curbing transport emissions.  The good work the EPA has noted will be undone by this decision.Let us look at the impact the Bill will have on the motorist's pocket and the broader issue of transport costs.  In a recent Eurobarometer survey of the issues Irish people ranked as the most important facing them personally, cost of living was ranked highest by 44% of respondents.  The Bill compounds these concerns for the motorists who purchased low emission cars in the past few years.  Motorists in the A band will pay an additional €56, a 53.8% increase; motorists in band B face a €69 increase, a 44.2% increase; motorists in band C will face a 9.3% increase, while those in bands D to G face a 7.5% increase.  The choice to buy clean and green has been hit with an increase of €56 and €69 in fees, respectively.  This amounts to a breach of trust.  How seriously can we take future promises on incentivising environmentally friendly purchases when previous commitments are not honoured?It would be remiss of me not to place these hikes in the context of broader fuel price increases and rising costs for transport across the board.  According to the AA's research, the price of a litre of petrol has gone up by 2.1 cent since last month, while the price of diesel has gone up by 1.3 cent a litre.  The AA states a weaker euro and high wholesale fuel costs across Europe are factors in the price hikes.  However, it specifically criticises fuel taxes as the major cause of ramping up fuel prices and hitting motorists hard.  The cost of petrol has hit €1.60 a litre and is heading towards €1.70 in some stations.  Rising fears about the impact of the Iranian oil embargo and the volatile situation in the Middle East, exacerbated by the euro crisis, mean the €2 a litre barrier could potentially be breached.As the price of oil has broken the $120 a barrel barrier, the need to address fuel costs should be pressing for the Government.  Tackling these costs will be vital to ensuring Ireland remains competitive and the domestic economy will have an opportunity to expand.  The decline in consumer spending and the erosion of take-home pay are undermining the potential for economic growth.  Tackling fundamental transport costs, therefore, cannot be ignored by the Government.  The Bill, however, further hits certain motorists in the wallet, with other price hikes resulting from the 2% increase in VAT.The connection between the rate of tax one pays and the CO2 emissions from one's car was at the heart of the introduction of the CO2 based bands in 2008.  It ensured there would be a link in the motorist's mind between driving an environmentally friendly car and paying a low rate of motor tax.  This decision erodes that connection.  It downgrades the importance of environmentally sound practices at the heart of broader public policy.  Specifically, it downgrades the use of taxation to pursue a broader goal, whereby people are given the opportunity to directly respond to monetary incentives.  The overarching goal of combating climate change, one of the most serious challenges we face globally, has been neglected by the Government.Compounded by broader increases in fuel prices, the Bill hits motorists who purchased cars in good faith, in the knowledge that they would enjoy lower costs because their cars formed part of broader efforts to tackle climate change.  If the Government takes the issue of climate change seriously, it must take a proactive approach to establishing incentives to shift attitudes and behaviour.  Penalising those motorists who responded to such worthwhile efforts is a retrograde step that sets an unfortunate precedent for future public policy.  Government efforts will be viewed more sceptically and the response will be more muted than the resounding success of this effort to encourage low CO2 car purchases.I call on the Government to review its decision, affirm the importance of using public policy to pursue key environmental goals and set out its priorities in establishing real, meaningful incentives in tackling climate change.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I am speaking on behalf of Deputy Dessie Ellis.The Bill implements increases in motor vehicle tax and trade plate licences and, as the Minister said, provides for some technical changes.  After 1 January, flat rate increases in the different tax bands for private vehicles were imposed.  The increases range from 7.5% in bands D and G, the worst bands in terms of emissions, to much higher increases for low emission vehicles, with the A and B bands being increased by 54% and 44%, respectively.  That will still leave band A at half the price for band C, but this increase cannot be wrapped in a cloak of environmental concern.  It is purely a revenue raising measure, which the Minister should acknowledge.Sinn Féin recognises the gap between revenue and spending in the State and the need to increase revenue through taxation.  We are often accused of not understanding the need to close this gap which we understand must be closed.  However, the measures being adopted by the Government are, frankly, an attempt to fool people into believing they are not being taxed unfairly.  In fact, they are subject to many stealth taxes and charges which they must pay from their dwindling pay packets each week.  Fine Gael, in particular, likes to describe itself as a low tax party, but I would describe it as a stealth tax party.  These stealth taxes are strangling people who are struggling to keep their noses above water every day, week and month.I have heard Ministers talk in this Chamber about the hard choices they must make in government.  The ones who must make the really hard choices are those who must make a choice between purchasing a refill of heating oil and paying rent for a private house and between sending a child for further education and putting food on the table for the rest of their children.  The hard choices are being made by families with children.  They have to decide whether to stay here and be unemployed or emigrate.  It is people like that, and not Ministers or politicians, who are making the hard choices.  They are making those hard choices because of us.The Government must recognise that the way to address the shortfall in revenue is to introduce real taxation reform.  This is absent from all the piecemeal increases we see day and daily.  The Government must begin to understand that we live in a woefully unequal society which takes a great proportion of income from low and middle income earners and provides fewer and fewer rights and entitlements to public services.  Sinn Féin argued that the introduction of a wealth tax and a higher rate of income tax would go a long way towards raising the real funds needed for the running of the State and the provision of our services.Another simple option which could be implemented in a Bill such as this would be the introduction of a higher tax rate for the, so called, luxury cars that are the preserve of those the Government is so unwilling to make pay their fair share in other taxation measures.While the Bill will make it harder for ordinary folk to keep a car, several other Government measures are making it more difficult for them to avail of public transport, with cuts in public transport, closure of some services and fare increases on the remaining services.  People are angry when they see how the money that is being taken from the people is being used.  There are bonuses for super junior ministers, the Chief Whip and committee chairmen and junkets by committees, including that of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht to oversee St. Patrick's Day festivities, never mind the billions in bondholder pay-offs, the money for NAMA developers and tax cuts for those earning between €75,000 and €300,000 a year.  The people who are making those very hard and very real choices are angry because they see that the money being taken from them is not being invested properly.The Bill has no strategy or vision for the future.  It is simply a revenue raising operation targeted at people who cannot afford any more and who have already taken so much on the chin.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said the income of ordinary people would not be touched by the budget.  That was untrue.  The Bill is a small example of that untruth.  Ordinary people are adversely impacted by these increases.This is particularly true in rural areas.  The lack of rural transport infrastructure means that people are even more dependant on their vehicles.  There have been cuts to rural transport schemes and rising fuel prices.  The Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, must have been very good at division when he was at school.  When he admonished those of us who opposed the household charge he said it was only €100 a year.

It was €2 a week.  Today, he spoke about the annual tax increase of €13 a year, or 25 cent a week.  The Irish Independent  of Monday 30 January, following an investigation, pointed out that for the first time ever the cost of running the average family car had exceeded €100 per week.  Where is the 25 cent per week there?  That figure did not include depreciation.This is a Bill and a Government without vision or a strategy for where we want to see the country positioned.  This is a Bill and a Government that should be changed.The Bill will pass, because the Government has the numbers in the Houses, but people will still be angry and I will still stand here trying to express their anger.  I do not know how long it will take to make a difference, but a difference will be made.

The increases in car tax will be difficult for people in a number of ways.  There are huge tax increases in relation to CO2 emissions from vehicles.  Changes range from 7% to 54%, depending on the band of the vehicle.  The main changes on the A and B bands are 54% and 44% respectively.  This is a betrayal of the people who, luckily for themselves, were in a position to purchase a vehicle since 2008 and avail of the lower tax rates on cars with lower CO2 emissions.  They felt they were contributing to an environmental improvement by purchasing and using a vehicle that had lower emissions.  There was a reward for contributing to an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.The increase of 7.5% across the board on all private vehicles is a regressive step.  It penalises people who were not in a position to purchase newer vehicles in recent years and who, through no fault of their own and particularly in rural areas where there is no public transport, depend on the car to look for work and stay in work.  An increase of 7.5% is a huge burden on those people.People who purchased diesel cars because they were more economical to run will see significant increases in their motor tax because of the implementation of the Bill.People are right to feel a sense of betrayal.  The Minister spoke about the need to maintain a diversified and stable taxation system and said the loss of taxation income represents an opportunity cost that must be rectified.  It is unfair for the Government to look for opportunities to generate more funding and to squeeze more out of hard pressed people who are dependant on cars in their daily lives.  The Bill will place a huge burden on them.Even more galling is the fact that the increased revenue generated will go straight to paying off the national debt.  The €46 million raised by these taxation measures will make little difference to the more than €80 billion worth of debt, or even to this year's interest payments.  It is a mere drop in the ocean.This also represents a betrayal of the local government fund.  Since 1997, revenue from car tax has been ring-fenced for the local government fund, providing much needed funding to local authorities.  These increases will go towards writing down debt.  We expect further increases over the next couple of years, solely to write down our debt to the IMF the ECB and the European Commission.     It sticks in the people's throats.  They see the real reason behind this increase in motor tax as solely being to deal with that debt.  It is not to increase revenue or services, to copperfasten any reductions in carbon dioxide emissions or to further develop the system.  It is only to hand back to the troika and ensure it is kept happy by the €46.5 million that will be generated this year from the increase.  That will surely make an impact on the €4.5 billion in interest payments alone this year on our debt.I suppose it shows the level to which the troika and the Government are prepared to go to squeeze extra money out of people who are already suffering in terms of the household tax, the septic tank charge, the universal social charge, cuts in wages, unemployment and cuts in social welfare.  It is a slap in the face for people to see that this €46 million will merely be transferred directly to the troika.  For that reason, the amendment the Minister proposes to bring forward to alter the Local Government Act to allow for this money to be transferred directly to the Exchequer should be opposed.There has been a cut in local government funding already this year.  It was announced on budget day that it will be reduced by €173 million, not €164 million as the Minister outlined in his speech.  It shows that there will be further cuts in local government services.  The argument that paying charges helps to increase and support services does not stand up because there will be further cuts in the services available through local authorities in order that money can be passed back to the troika to fund the totally unsustainable debt.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I thank Deputy Pringle and the Technical Group for allowing me the opportunity to use some of its time to speak on this important subject.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and thank him for being present.There are a number of important issues which I want to raise about this matter.  First, it is unfair on those who in good faith went out and purchased what are classified as environmentally friendly cars and who thought that they were doing right.  They were advised and encouraged to do so and I would have been sure that the Government would have honoured the promise made in the past to keep the tax on such motor cars at a lower rate than that on all other cars.  Unfortunately, the Minister has seen fit to increase the cost by a considerable sum, especially at a time when money is scarce.It is on that subject, too, that I want to ask the Government whether it realises what is happening in the country with the cost of fuel.  It is ridiculous.  It costs between €80 and €100 to fill any type of ordinary van or car.  If it was to be exactly half that amount, it would still be a considerable sum.  I must declare an interest in this as I have a small country filling station.  I am acutely aware of what people are being put through with the high cost of fuel.  I never thought I would live to see the day when an articulated lorry would pull up at a diesel pump and it would cost €1,460 to fill it.  When one thinks about it, it is ridiculous.

This comes back to a rural-urban divide in that those living in the countryside, by the very fact of where they are, must rise every morning and try to get work.  Whether they go in a motor car or in a van, they are continuously using fuel.  That is why they see it as a particularly bad hit by the Government on them to put this further burden of cost on their travel.I never thought I would live to see the day, which is fast approaching, when fuel costs €2 a litre.  If one says it quickly and does not think about it, one does not realise how bad it is, but it is when one comes along to fill a gallon can at a petrol or diesel pump and one sees the small drop one is getting for a considerable sum of money that one realises it is outrageous.To be honest, and the Minister is extremely busy but at the same time he has his constituents, he does not have his head in the sand and he knows what is going on, this is - besides the septic tanks-----

Seriously, it is a significant problem at present and the people are really concerned about it.This comes back to the matter of global warming, the ozone layer, etc.  At the end of the day, Ireland is a very small country and the amount that we contribute to global warming or to the problems with the ozone layer is minuscule.  This is a small country on the periphery of Europe.  There are the big block countries in North America and South America and China with billions of people, and here we are.  If Europe or anybody else in the world dictates that we must do this or that, we will jump through rings to comply with every rule, law and regulation while there are others who seem to be able to do whatever they like.  Returning to the environmentally friendly cars, that is why people are really sour about this, and they are also really sore about it.I apologise for going around the garden, but I believe the subject of global warming is an industry in itself.  In the 12th and 13th centuries, our little country was burnt.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, it was drowned.  From 1740, it rained continuously for two years.

There was no such thing as silage at that time.  The cattle died; everything died.  In 1880, again it rained continuously for two years.  The funny aspect of it is that there was not one combustible engine in Ireland at the time.  Why is it that we are blaming it all on global warming?  These cycles happened over the generations.  It seems now there are lobbyists and those who, as I stated, make an industry out of the subject of global warming.  It is a considerable subject for the media which can sell thousands of hours of television and radio and print material about global warming.  As I stated, in past years there were all these severe cycles of weather and there was no such thing as a combustible engine.On diesel versus petrol engines, motorists were always encouraged to spend that extra bit to buy a car or van with a diesel engine because they would save in the long run.  Unfortunately, that is not now the case and these motorists are left high and dry with the vehicles.It is a shame and scandal to think that not one pothole will be filled with the extra money that will be raised by the Minister's increases.  Not one mile of road will be surfaced with it.  There will not be one dyke opened.  There will not be one gullet put across a road to take water from one side to the other.  As Deputy Pringle correctly pointed out earlier, the money will go to pay an insurmountable debt.  I would ask the Minister during the course of this debate to acknowledge that people are angry about the high cost of motoring.  It would be seen both as a proactive and welcome departure by the Government and also as supporting rural communities if, to encourage motorists to use their vehicles to go out to try to get work, it decided to be radical in its thinking and reduce the tax taken out of every €10 of petrol or diesel.  This would be seen as a very positive move and would help in reducing the high cost of home heating oil.At present, many people, in particular the elderly, are cold in their homes because they have central heating but they cannot afford to use it.  There is a new practice, which never happened before, whereby people are going to petrol stations with a 5 gallon drum to buy home heating oil.  Previously, if money was scarce, a person could telephone the oil company and ask for €100, €150 or €200 worth of home heating oil but people now cannot afford to do that.  Instead, they must go to a petrol station with a 5 gallon drum or, in the case of an elderly person, send someone else to buy 20 or 25 litres of home heating oil, then try to measure that out and make it last for as long as possible.  I am sad to say this, as I did not think I would live to see the day when people's money would be so limited and the cost would be so expensive that they just could not afford it.  In the interest of helping people at a particularly tough time, the Government should be radical.  I know the answer will be that the Government needs to take every euro it can out of every €10 but it is wrong.  In the long run, it would get more if it took less.  The Minister is looking sceptically at me but I believe in what I am saying.I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this subject.  As with many of the debates taking place in the House, given the massive majority the Government has, it literally has a free hand with whatever it wants to impose.  The Opposition can do what it likes but, at the end of the day, it relies on the Government to do the right thing because it is not in a position to force the Government's hand.  All it can do is make suggestions in an honest and fair way, which is what it always tries to do.If I find something good in what the Government is doing, I will be the first to compliment it.  If I see something wrong, and that it is letting the people down, I will always highlight that.  However, I hope, because of the massive majority the Government has, it will try to be fair at the end of the day.  In increasing the cost of motoring, the Government is not being fair to the people who elected it.  They did not send the Government here to further drive up the cost of motoring, particularly at this time.In recent days, I had to listen to a Government-supporting Deputy say he had to support the Government because he was the only Deputy in his constituency who supports it.  The answer I gave him was that this was the problem - there are too many of them.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The reality for ordinary people is completely different from what is set out in the Government amendment.  The Sinn Féin Party's proposal is far more representative of the true situation.  This morning the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine issued an alarming statement on the crisis in hospitals throughout the State, with a particular focus on children's hospitals.  At Crumlin hospital, in my constituency, children are waiting 12 hours on a trolley and 24 hours to be admitted to a bed.  The number waiting on trolleys there has increased by 700% in the past seven years.  Temple Street hospital is described by the association as "significantly overcrowded".  At St. Vincent's hospital, meanwhile, 40 patients were waiting for beds yesterday morning, with 60 to 70 awaiting treatment in the accident and emergency department.All of this is in stark contrast to the claims made by the Government about the health service.  There is a crisis in hospitals in terms of access to beds, particularly in the winter, yet no account has been taken of this by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in his plan for health services delivery.  Beds must be reopened without delay, particularly for cystic fibrosis patients at St. Vincent's hospital.  One such patient had to wait overnight in the accident and emergency department before being admitted.  That is a terrible indictment of the health service.  We all know that cystic fibrosis sufferers should not be left in an open ward or accident and emergency department for any length of time.  The bottom line was that the hospital had no bed to cater for this patient.  The Government amendment does not reflect reality.  I urge the Minister to ensure beds are reopened in the winter.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	531	It is time the Government admitted the reality of what is happening in the health service and dispensed with the ridiculous and meaningless slogan of "getting more for less".  The evidence everywhere is that as a result of the vicious cuts the Government is imposing on the health service, we are getting considerably less for less.  Sick and vulnerable people, including children in Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals, are suffering as a result of the cuts.  It is as simple as that.  Sick children are waiting on trolleys for hours on end.  The most vulnerable members of our society, those who most need to be protected and cared for when they are unwell, are feeling the effects.  When there are reductions in ambulance and accident and emergency services, bed closures and reduction in the numbers of health professionals in the system, one is inevitably faced with a disaster descending on the health service.  That disaster will only get worse as rising health insurance premia mean that more people will be forced to depend on a public system that is entirely unfit for purpose and being carved up in order to pay off the bankers and bondholders who have ruined the economy of the State and are ruining the European economy.The Minister's plans to close down local accident and emergency services in hospitals throughout the State are of particular concern.  I have a special interest in St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown where the plan seems to be - the Minister will not confirm it one way or the other - to shut down the 24 hour accident and emergency service at the end of March.  As recently as last month, Professor John Nichols, speaking at the Royal College of Surgeons, stated categorically that the distance a patient had to travel in an ambulance to receive treatment was a matter of life and death.  If local 24 hour accident and emergency services were shut down, he said, more people would die.  I appeal to the Government to end the butchery of local accident and emergency departments at Loughlinstown and elsewhere and to reinstate those such as the service in Roscommon which have been closed.  We must stop the cuts in order to save lives.  The bankers and the rich should be made to pay for the economic mess, not the sick and the vulnerable.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I agree with much of the sentiment behind the motion and understand the emotion being expressed on this side of the House.  Even if one looks at the health service and the Health Service Executive in a very forensic way, one cannot justify what is happening.  Looking at the figures in a cold, calculating way shows that the behaviour of those involved is unacceptable.  To anybody who observes a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts at which representatives of the HSE are in attendance, it is clear that they are simply putting out fire after fire.  On every question one asks, every flank on which one attacks or criticises, they are vulnerable and wrong.The Health Service Executive is flawed, rotten, inefficient and politicised.  It is incapable of managing the problems with which it is presented and has not done so for many years.  Successive Governments have also shown themselves to be completely incapable of dealing with the difficulties.  The problems are absolutely manifest, but above all is the loss of faith by the public in the HSE.  That loss of faith is a consequence of people's inability to access what they consider to be rightful and proper treatment because of the cuts that have been imposed.  The reason for this is partly, like many semi-State organisations, the Health Service Executive has built an empire, the interest of which, in the end, is to defend and expand itself.Anybody who has attended the meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts will have seen that the management has completely lost sight of its objective, purpose and mission, which is to look after the health of the patients of Ireland.  That is not the focus of senior figures in the organisation.  Instead they are focused on defending themselves and their patch.  There is a great deal of evidence to indicate that this is the case, part of which is the raw figure that 16% of personnel in the HSE are administrative staff, while at the same time there is a shortage of front-line staff.  An observation made by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, when in opposition illustrates the reality of the situation:The HSE are engaged in industrious futility, running around filling out very extensive reports that are terribly important in their own minds but which do not result in an iota of improvement in care or a single new service.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has indicated that I have only two minutes in which to make my contribution.  I might not be able to stop once I get going.I compliment the Deputies who brought forward the motion.  The Health Service Executive is a total disaster.  We have heard so much from the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, about his intention to abolish it.  Instead he has merely tinkered with the board.  It is an out-of-control juggernaut, a train that must be derailed.  I made this argument many times to the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney.  We hear about all the positive developments under the HSE, but they are spoiled by the very nature of the beast that it is the system which is simply abominable.I walked out of a meeting with representatives of the HSE in Tipperary last week.  Having been one and a half hours late in arriving for the previous meeting, they were 40 minutes late on this occasion.  They have no respect for the Minister, his Ministers of State, Deputies or anybody else.  Many of the senior managers are self-serving and concerned only with career building and ascending the ladder.  We saw this when the health boards were amalgamated and not one job was lost.  The Minister should know the situation well as a former president of the Irish Medical Organisation, in which capacity he negotiated some of the great deals for doctors and consultants.  They are the only ones in the system whose pay has not been cut.  Patients are waiting on trolleys, ambulance services are being cut, care homes are being closed down and so on, yet we continue to ignore the elephant in the room - consultants' pay.  We are told there will be greater productivity if salaries are not reduced.  That is patent nonsense.  The people concerned are very eminent in their own right, but they cannot be treated like sacred cows.  Everybody must feel the pain.  Senior consultants are using public beds to treat private patients.  A fitter and so on must provide his or her own premises and facilities.  Former Minister Barry Desmond tried to abolish this practice a number of years ago but failed.  Things have gotten worse since.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, acquiesced to the consultants and now lacks the moral credibility to retract that to which he agreed.

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	536	A number of the Private Members' motions tabled during the lifetime of this Dáil have been positive.  This motion is, however, the most hypocritical and nonsensical tabled thus far.  The HSE was mentioned by Fianna Fáil Deputies eight times.  However, none mentioned that the HSE was established by Deputy Martin, when Minister for Health and Children.  We had 14 years of Fianna Fáil in Government during which time former Deputies Brian Cowen and Mary Harney were responsible for the health portfolio and services provided to the people of our country deteriorated.  This changed when Deputy James Reilly became Minister for Health.The Minister has through the special delivery unit put in place targets which were achieved in year one.  No targets were set during the lifetime of the previous Administration.  I agree that it is extremely regrettable that owing to the mismanagement and abuse of our country by Fianna Fáil we now have to take €1 billion out of the health service to restore our independence and sovereignty.  The Minister for Health is to be commended on achieving his targets last year in respect of a reduction in the number of people on trolleys, a reduction in waiting times for people needing elective surgery and his development of a strong momentum towards free GP and universal care, which the people of our country voted for in such huge numbers.  The Government and Minister have this month set new targets in this regard.The creation of 1,000 new jobs in the north east was announced today.  Yet we are faced again this evening with this doomsday nonsense.  Week after week this Government is proving that it is able to combat and that there is a better way for our people.  For Fianna Fáil to criticise the monster that is the HSE, which it created, smacks of hypocrisy and nonsense.  The people are aware, as the good news continues to be announced, that Fianna Fáil is becoming more and more desperate.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Bearing in mind that one in four people will suffer mental health difficulties at some stage in their lives I would have expected mental health services to be included in a general motion on health services.I would like to address the issue of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  While the figures in respect of the number of children admitted to adult psychiatric services have reduced, it is totally unacceptable that there were 129 notifications of under-age admissions to adult approved centres last year.  I know the Minister's objective is to have no child or adolescent patient in adult psychiatric centres, which are totally unsuitable.  Existing adult psychiatric services are poorly resourced to deal with children and adolescents owing to the different emphasis placed on a development prospective which needs to focus on families of young people, schools and social intervention rather than on treatment of the psychiatric difficulty.Adult services do not have inpatient facilities that are appropriate for the admission of adolescents for various reasons, including health and safety and treatment issues.  Adult outpatient clinics are generally not adolescent friendly.  There is also a difficulty in regard to the provision of services for 16 to 18 year olds in that they are not eligible for adult or child psychiatric services.  There is a gap in respect of services in this regard.  The frequent need for an urgent response to problems presented by children and adolescents leads services to deal disproportionately with adolescents at the expense of their work with young children.  In other words, when adolescents present, the service must deal disproportionately with young people.It is totally unacceptable that children must wait six months to three years for psychiatric services.  With early intervention, there is a 90% chance of cure but with late intervention the patient's condition becomes chronic.

However, appointment of a director of mental health services within the HSE is urgent to ensure that money is spent on that for which it is designated.  A previous Minister allocated €50 million to A Vision for Change, only €27 million of which was spent on psychiatric services.  We must ensure the €30 million allocated to this area is spent on that for which it was allocated.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I support the Government amendment.  The Government is determined to reform the health service.  While this poses a challenge to Government, we will meet it.  However, reform will take some time.The Opposition motion states that our plan for reform will fail despite that we have not yet had an opportunity to complete it.  Fianna Fáil knows all about failure.  Its plans failed.  While expenditure in the health service doubled during Fianna Fáil's time in office, it left us with an under-performing health service.

#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	558	We need to learn from the previous Government's mistakes.  We must ensure we do not repeat them as they have been very costly to the taxpayer.  The HSE needs to be restructured and this process was commenced with the putting in place of a new board and will be continued by way of the forthcoming health service legislation.  Reform of the health service has also commenced.  The move towards universal health insurance commenced with this year's budget, which means free GP care to long term illness claimants will commence this year.  In 2013, GP care will be extended to patients who receive medicines under the high-tech drugs scheme.  This will be followed by access to subsidised GP care for all.  The Government's plans are ambitious but they are achievable through better use of resources.The motion before us also deals with the north-east service plan, which takes in County Meath.  While the budget for this plan is being reduced it must be recognised that investment in services continues.  For example, €5 million has been provided for primary care service staff in primary care centres, such as the one due to open in Ashbourne in the autumn.  This centre will provide a comprehensive service to residents in that area.  It is good news for the residents of Ashbourne and for nearby hospitals as illnesses are identified earlier and treated quicker.  The roll out of primary care centres in Ashbourne and other areas around the country is key to our overall health strategy.  The result will be a more effective spend for the taxpayer, one that ensures better outcomes for patients.

The development of primary care services is highly important and I believe it to be an essential component of the health services reform process.  Moreover, it was a key issue during last year's general election.  I will take this opportunity to commend the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on the manner in which he literally has taken this issue by the scruff of the neck whereas others, who were his predecessors not that long ago, considered the health portfolio to be akin to Angola.

#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	561	In a developed primary care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  I recently visited the soon-to-be opened primary care facility for Palmerstown and Ballyfermot.  It is a fantastic facility that will change for the better the entire manner in which health care is delivered in the community.  The ambition of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is to have primary care as a linchpin for health services, including mental health services, for the young, the old, the dependent, the able and those with learning disabilities, that is, for all citizens of the State.  This ambition must be supported and admired.A key objective of the primary care strategy is to develop services in the community which would give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, social care workers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and so on.  Moreover, additional services, including speech and language therapy, may be provided on a sessional basis.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals.  Initially, free GP cover will be extended to persons in receipt of drugs and medicines under the long-term illness scheme.  Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment and it is expected that the new arrangements will be in place by this summer.  A project team of officials from the Department and from the Health Service Executive has been established to oversee the implementation of the universal primary care strategy and I understand this project team met for the first time on 24 January.  I commend the primary care concept and the new facilities, including the aforementioned facility that is coming on-stream and which will cater for Palmerstown and Ballyfermot.

Arguably, he has the most difficult job in the Government, which is to try to overhaul radically the health service at a time of reducing budgets.  I decided to speak on this motion when I read its contents and Fianna Fáil Members have a barefaced cheek to propose a motion that mentions items such as the centralised medical card system, the introduction of which was overseen by that party just before it left office.

This motion refers to the cut of €750 million in the HSE's funding but does not acknowledge the role Fianna Fáil played in the fact that funding cuts are taking place across all Departments.  The motion also mentions the early retirement scheme and the possible detrimental effects it might have but, again, the date of that scheme was decided upon by Fianna Fáil when in government.

It is not acceptable to see people at that stage in their lives, who have contributed as taxpayers and ordinary, decent citizens, effectively being put out of their beds.One must remember that 75% of the funding in the health service is spent on pay and pensions and not on the actual service.  Consequently, any cuts must be made to the other 25%, which comprises trimming at the edges.  In addition, there are significant difficulties in my own locality in respect of orthopaedic surgery and EMT specialists.  It is important that such essential services, which are the cornerstone of the delivery of any health service, be protected.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	597	In a way, I admire what Fianna Fáil is trying to do.  Moreover, it is not simply trying to do this at national level, because it also is so engaged at county and town council levels.  It is attempting to disassociate the past from the present.  That is fair enough and is an admirable thing to do but unfortunately, the past always is a significant factorial of the present.  This is the case on an individual basis in one's own life when one looks back on the past and considers how it shapes one's future.  Unfortunately, I refer to the components and factorials of the past in respect of the input of Fianna Fáil's boss man, Deputy Martin, who, as Minister between 2000 and 2004, spent €16 million on reports while creating the HSE.  More ironically, in 2000 he spent €600,000 on a value for money audit while creating the culture of the HSE monster that is alive and present in the world in which Members now live.  As Deputy Hannigan noted, it will take a long time to sort it out.As recently as last Friday, the HSE met in Galway to discuss the service plan for the HSE est region-----

After two hours of that meeting had elapsed, a Fianna Fáil participant made a sensible suggestion.  He advocated that participants should break up into groups based on significant geographical parts to discuss the issues which were relevant to their respective areas.  It was a sensible suggestion which basically was reminiscent of the old health boards in which there was local autonomy, local responsibility and local power over decision-making.  All that was taken away from the people with the creation of the HSE monster.  That is the real and present danger the Government has inherited from Fianna Fáil's past in power and its contribution.  I stated that I admire what it is trying to do, which is to create complete amnesia and to suggest the past does not relate to the present.  However, the unfortunate reality is that it does.

When it comes to acute hospitals, the Minister is taking a very important step in proposing a new structure that will recognise the reality that no hospital operates in isolation.

The Minister proposes that we will see an acute hospital group with a consolidated management team operated by a group CEO.  What does that mean?  It means we will have accountability and deliverability.  It also means that we will ensure that the smaller hospitals will play a vital role in our health service.Everybody understands why Fianna Fáil opposes the introduction of reconstituted not-for-profit hospital trusts.  When in government, Fianna Fáil and its obsolete friends in the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party supported the for-profit model of collocation.  Does Deputy Kelleher remember collocation?  Deputy Martin opposed it in Cork because it was bad for him politically.

How can Fianna Fáil Members even think of putting such a thing on paper?  This is the party that led us to the bailout by the troika and the horrendous mismanagement of the banks.  This is directly why there have had to be serious cuts of €750 million to our health budget.  When the Fianna Fáil Government had money, it threw it around like confetti and it was not used correctly.  Deputy McHugh went into some of the detail of that a few minutes ago, so there is no need for me to go into it again.

I would like to deal with local issues in Limerick.  It is a fair comment to say that the previous Government threw money at the health service, but there was a lack of coherent strategy on how that money could be used effectively.  Times are tough, money is tight and people are finding it very difficult at the moment, but the Minister is trying to bring in a new way of doing things.  We have had reconfiguration in the mid-west region.  There is a review under way on funding to the region.Last Saturday the Minister visited the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick for the second time in eight weeks.  The current facility at the hospital is not adequate to meet existing needs and priority is being given to putting a new one in place.  A new primary care centre is due to open shortly at King's Island on the north side of Limerick city, which is a welcome development.  The HSE has put in place proper plans to ensure - despite the departure of nursing staff before the end of this month - that an excellent service will continue to be provided at the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital in Limerick.The Minister is trying to do things in a new way and operating within the constraints created by a lack of funding.  However, it is not always about spending; there is also a need to do things in the right way.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	673	I commend Deputy Kelleher for tabling the motion.  One of the major issues that has arisen during this debate is that of staffing.  I was glad all my Dáil and Seanad colleagues from Galway were invited to attend a meeting to discuss this and other matters with the new area manager for counties Galway and Roscommon, Ms Catherine Cunningham.  At that meeting we were well briefed on what was happening.  What is sad is that in Galway alone some 113 people, 56 of whom are nurses, will be leaving the HSE this month.  This is giving rise to serious problems.  For example, there is an issue with the provision of public nursing services in the Connemara area.Another serious issue which arises is that of home help services.  Age Action Ireland has indicated that there has been a reduction of almost 500,000 in the number of home help hours since last year in the HSE West region.  This is a massive decrease and equates to a cut of €105 million in monetary terms.  Some 683 staff are set to retire across the region which is huge - it stretches all the way from County Limerick to County Donegal.  The HSE West director has stated a number of key challenges have arisen and that, in the light of the reductions in staff and funding to which I refer, he is going to have a difficult job in maintaining front-line services.  I am concerned about this.  I am also concerned about the provision of palliative care services, as we are fighting for funding for Galway hospice.Deputy Neville referred the provision of services for children.  I have a major concern about this matter, particularly as headlines in the Irish Independent in recent weeks pointed to delays in screening and the fact that babies were at risk as a result of a failure on the part of the HSE to meet check-up dates.  Some children are faced with a three year wait in order to receive vital dental treatment.  In south-east Galway there is no dentist available between Loughrea and Portumna.  Priority must be given to the provision of services of this nature for children.I must refer to the shortage of nurses in orthopaedic departments.  I understand HSE West plans to reduce its health budget by 5.2%.  Obviously, orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Hospital in Galway have been hit as a result of this announcement.  The number of beds in the orthopaedic ward at the hospital has been cut.  In addition, there is a serious deficit of nursing staff in the operating theatres in University College Hospital, Galway.  Patients presenting at the accident and emergency departments there and in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe will be obliged to wait longer in order to receive surgical care.I am concerned about the number of acute beds in the psychiatric services in the HSE West region.  Some 15 beds have been lost at St. Brigid's Psychiatric Hospital, Ballinasloe, a town in which there is an acute hospital.  I cannot understand what has been done in this instance.  However, it is welcome that a new primary care centre is to be set up in Athenry.The HSE's national service plan refers to the upgrading of endoscopy services at Roscommon County Hospital, but that is not what the people of Roscommon were seeking.  They wanted to retain the 24 hour accident and emergency department.  The Minister and the Government should be providing badly needed services at such facilities.Age Action Ireland has stated:The loss of so many public beds and the scale of the cuts in the home help service provided by the HSE will undoubtedly be felt by the sickest of older people [and is a real cause for concern].  Without a home help service frail older people will struggle, and those requiring round the clock nursing home care will end up being admitted to acute hospitals for their care if a nursing home bed is not available.I hope the Government will give consideration to the issues to which I refer.  I particularly hope it will examine the position in rural areas.  Many people who live in such areas do not have access to the services of home helps or public health nurses.  Those who do not have cars are becoming increasingly physically and socially  isolated as a result of the withdrawal of services.  I hope the Minister will take the points I have made on board.

I wish to focus on the Government amendment.  I am aware that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is not a shy person and that he does not lack self-confidence, but, by God, the amendment certainly brings that self-confidence to a new level.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	676	Everyone is aware of the serious difficulties in respect of medical cards.  The amendment refers to the fact that medical cards are the subject of a review process, which is welcome.  However, this fact has not been communicated, as  there are still long delays for those applying for a new medical card.  Surely it would not be beyond our abilities to introduce an emergency system for medical cards.  Such a system would be of assistance in a particular case to which I have previously referred in the House.  It involves a man who, as a result of contracting diabetes, lost a leg last September.  Between my office and his family, the relevant information on his case has been sent to the central unit on six occasions.  On five occasions the information was lost.  We are still awaiting an indication of what has happened in our sixth attempt.  It is almost March and the man does not have a medical card.  No one can stand over a system which gives rise to such delays.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	677	The Deputy can forward the relevant information to me.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	678	There is a need for an emergency system to cater for the needs of persons who, literally out of nowhere, have medical demands placed upon them.  Surely it is not beyond our abilities to create such a system.The amendment which recognises that there are problems raises a white flag in respect of community nursing homes.  Instead of raising the white flag and announcing the closure of 800 beds across the country, including almost 60 in my home county, we should be championing these nursing homes, as we want to keep people in their local communities.  We all agree that it is better for them to remain there because they can be near to their families, friends and the facilities with which they are familiar and this leads to their having healthier lives.  Instead, we have been presented with a policy of centralisation in larger units in which those to whom I refer will not be given the care and attention they currently receive.Surely it should be within the capabilities of the Government and the Oireachtas to consider how we can promote and champion community nursing homes.  When I first became a Member of the House in 2007, there was a huge demand for such nursing homes, but that is no longer the case.  However, we and the HSE - whatever is left of it - need to start promoting community nursing homes as being open for business.  We are expecting the entire civil and public service to state they are open for business and that they want to provide services.  The staff at facilities such as St. Augustine's in Ballina want to say they are open for business.  However, some of the best have been closed.  These beds could be reopened and paid for if people were given the opportunity to actually occupy them.The issue of children on trolleys was raised during Leaders' Questions this morning.  The figures provided by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, IMNO, by means of its trolley watch facility - this is now recognised as the Government standard - are beginning to creep upwards again.  Surely, none of us would attempt to stand over the placing of children on trolleys.  In fairness, the Minister is a GP and is aware of the position.  He is in Cavan this evening and I hope he will have the opportunity to visit Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin in order that he might see the children waiting on trolleys.  Last week I dealt with a case in which a one year old child who required emergency surgery was kept in Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar, for three days until a bed became available in Temple Street Children's Hospital.  We cannot stand over what happened in this instance.  This is a management issue, it does not relate to resources.I arrived in the Chamber when Deputy Mulherin was making her concluding remarks.  She stated she was sick of attending public meetings at which people spoke out of both sides of their mouths.  These comments were directed at me.  I do not speak out of both sides of my mouth.  At the meeting in question I asked why 12 beds at Ballina Hospital were being closed when HSE West had not collected €65 million from private health insurance companies.  I was not speaking out of both sides of my mouth; I was merely asking a question.  Only €500,000 would be required to keep the beds to which I refer open and some €65 million remains uncollected from private health insurance companies.  This amount could be used to fund a great deal of work in the HSE West region.I applaud the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on securing €35 million in funding and some 400 posts.  However, I have to ask why are psychiatric beds being closed in County Mayo and other parts of the country.  It has been stated there is no one available to fill particular jobs, but we are going to fill 400 positions later in the year.  Why is it not possible to fill these positions now?  Why not spend the €35 million to which I refer and retain the services already in place, rather than taking action later in the year?  I would almost bet money we will have an underspend of mental health funding this year because we will take so long to spend it.  This is another question I asked and I do not think I was speaking from any side of my mouth when I did so.  It was a straight question.  I hope we will get straight answers to the parliamentary questions we have tabled.The Minister, Deputy Reilly, played the ball and the man very hard.  This is not my style.  We want answers.  He took direct personal control.  He made a big deal of the fact that he is in charge and that independent directors are gone.  He stated he would be in charge and he would take the hits.  It is almost a year later and I am willing to give him time, but the omens are not good when we see what is happening.Deputy Mulherin was ranting and raving about the following point.  The Government has had a year to prepare for exits and retirements because it was known they would happen.  Any business, organisation or voluntary organisation would conduct scenario planning.  Why was it not done in the course of the past 12 months to account for those leaving?

This is probably why the motion has been tabled.  He certainly gave this impression not only to the Members of the House but very clearly to the public.  This obviously is not the case.

Therefore one cannot provide the direct response or position to the client or customer one represents in one's constituency.  This is not good politics and the Minister should correct it.I attended a meeting of the HSE in Kilkenny and I must state I was shocked, because none of the information or booklets we were given on the cutbacks on every service across the board - and we expected some reductions - had one single comment on how the administrative staff in the HSE, of which we are told 2,000 do not even know their job descriptions, were to be dealt with.  There was not one single line on it.  However, in every line the patient suffered because of the withdrawal of services.

Not only was I surprised, nurses in the services for years came to me and complained privately that psychiatric services in Carlow and Kilkenny would collapse because of the withdrawal of people delivering on the front line.

It might have been Fianna Fáil which stated we would have a national medical card application and appeals system; perhaps this was the case.  However, the Government has been in office for 12 months and this is an administrative issue which affects the constituents we represent.  There are examples of people who are terminally ill and cannot get their medical card renewed and therefore cannot access services.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	695	That has been resolved now.

Why does the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, not increase the number of staff?  A total of 150 people deal with all of these applications.  Why not increase this number?  Why not redeploy staff from places which are not that busy and ensure the medical cards which are so badly needed are delivered?Why did the Minister, when he knows it is not true, include this in the amendment?  It is ridiculous and a farce.

It is the least they deserve from a service that is supposed to deliver health services throughout the country.  I call for direct intervention by the Minister.  He often called for it when in opposition.  It is a pity he is not present to show some respect not only for the debate but for the patient whom we are trying to serve against a system which seems to be crumbling in front of the Minister.

Last Monday week I went with my colleagues, Deputies Twomey and Kehoe, to Wexford General Hospital to receive a briefing for Wexford Oireachtas Members.  In the room with us were hospital managers, HSE managers and community welfare managers.  I am not easily intimidated but there were so many people around the table I did feel a little intimidated by all of these managers who were there to tell us what we thought would be the factual situation.However, the first document we received was on service plan achievements and the very first page dealt with primary care teams.  It stated that in Enniscorthy, the design team has been engaged to respond to the schedule of accommodation.  The same was stated with regard to Gorey.  With regard to Wexford, which is one of the biggest urban centres in the county, it stated the respondents to the advertisements for primary care infrastructure have been unable to obtain GP engagement in the development and, accordingly, the Wexford local health office has been unable to progress with the development.  It stated that in Rosslare, a site has been identified and accepted by the HSE but the developer is unable to obtain GP engagement.These were presented as achievements by Mr. Healy who presented the information to us on the day.  Obviously nothing is happening and nothing will happen.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why there is no GP engagement in two of the areas.  I understood from what he stated here that primary care is the way forward, but GPs refuse to engage in two or three areas where the HSE stated it had made achievements.Wexford General Hospital will lose approximately 30 members of staff but those at the meeting had the cheek to tell us hospital services will not be affected.  Waterford Regional Hospital and Wexford General Hospital must be taken together because they are the two main hospitals in the south east and serve a huge population area.  We were told the closure of two operating theatres and 25 surgical beds in Waterford Regional Hospital would not affect services in the south east.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how he will lose members of staff and close wards and surgical areas but the people of the south east will not be affected.With regard to medical cards, we have the same problem as Deputy Dara Calleary outlined exists in Mayo.  Some people have been waiting since last June or July for a medical card to be approved.  The doctors in the Wexford area are very cynical about the situation.  They feel it is a delaying tactic to save money.  People who deserve to have medical cards, who are seriously ill and need them to get their medicines are being denied.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter.  In fairness, if one gets through to those working in the centralised centre, they will do their best to help and support one.  However, they state that because of a lack of staff, their hands are tied and they are not in a position to do anything about it.The large management team at the meeting told us there will be a 4.5% cut in home help hours.  The management states this will not affect older people, but how that might happen I do not know.  When one telephones, one is told that people who have home help will continue to have the service but new applications will not be accepted.The cuts in the home help service and the fair deal scheme must go hand in hand.  We talk a great deal about taking people out of hospitals.  There are a considerable number of people in Wexford General Hospital at present who would be able to leave if they got approval for the fair deal scheme.  There are serious issues regarding that scheme in my county and the south east.  Hundreds of patients are waiting to go into nursing homes but there is no funding within the scheme.  I received a reply last December stating no money was available in County Wexford for the fair deal scheme and the only way new patients could be admitted would be if patients in the fair deal scheme were to pass away.  That was an actual response I received - a disgraceful reply in the first place but also a disgraceful decision.  The Minister might also explain where the money for the fair deal scheme is.  Will he put money into the scheme and when will he do so?

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	709	Perhaps seven or eight minutes.  We must bear in mind that every party in this House contributed to the state of the health services today.  That applies even to the Minister of State's party.  Since the foundation of the State, successive Governments neglected the health infrastructure, in both physical and human resources, and the patient suffered.  It is a little rich to come into the Chamber and engage in a blame game, pointing the finger at Fianna Fáil.  The Government has been in office for 12 months and it is trying to shirk its responsibility.  It has not yet got into the groove of accepting responsibility but the clock will tick and eventually the penny will drop.It is ironic that the Government questions our mandate in regard to our right as democratically elected people to table a motion and have issues which concern the public addressed and debated in this House.  That is not ignorance; it is arrogance.  It did not take the Government parties long to become arrogant.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I do not know if that is true.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	711	It ill behoves anybody to come to the Chamber and question our mandate.  I was elected by the public just as any Member on the Government side of the House was so elected.  It is not a democratic stance to question anybody's legitimate mandate.On the motion, HSE west has had a reduction of 5% in its budget.  What has the Minister of State got against the people of Limerick and the mid-west?  Deputy O'Donnell addressed local issues and I, too, will address these areas.  Our share of the budget from HSE west has been reduced by 13% in the acute hospital groups around Limerick, while in the Galway region the figure has been reduced by 10%.  Why are the public and patients in Limerick being more discriminated against than patients in other parts of the country?  That is a legitimate question I was asked to raise.The funding of community services around Limerick has been reduced by 5%, which is the global cut to HSE west.  However, there is a further reduction of €19 million on top of that which arose from savings that had accrued the previous year.  These are now being rolled forward.  They were generated in good faith but now we are being penalised as a region in their regard.I wish to raise specific issues in respect of our community hospitals.  St. Camillus's was mentioned.  I refer to St. Ita's community hospital in Newcastle West in County Limerick.  An enormous community effort was supported by Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats, the Fine Gael Party and local communities throughout the years.  There were church gate collections and raffles.  Volunteerism in the truest sense of the word helped to contribute and build the services and facilities there.  There have already been 19 bed closures since last year and these are being followed by another ten.  That is disgraceful.  One must add to that the fact that our home help services will be reduced by 5%.  We are told that everybody will continue to receive a delivery of home help service but it will be less.The parties on the Government side promised no cuts in front-line services.  They must be reminded of this at every juncture although they refer to people talking out of both sides of their mouths at public meetings.  What does that promise mean?  What is a front-line service to somebody who needs home help?  A reduction to a person's home help service is a cut in a front-line service.  The Government parties should not come back and tell us we are engaging in hypocritical politics.  Those parties made this promise and the people voted for them on the basis there would be no cut in front-line services.When will the Government give local HSE management in the mid-west a baseline staff figure?  How can it expect people to manage the health services when they do not know the minimum threshold staff complement that will be available to them to provide a 24-7 service?  If the Government is to take control of the HSE, as it says it will, it should empower local management to have a minimum level of staff to plan their 24-7 roll-out of service.Limerick maternity hospital is the fifth busiest of the 19 maternity units in the country, catering for 5,500 births per annum.  It was a disgrace that two weeks in succession the Taoiseach came into the Chamber and rubbished a senior obstetrician consultant in this Parliament.  He rubbished him outright.  As the consultant's direct employer, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, should have defended him.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	721	Deputy Collins can have a minute of my time.  I thank Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion before the House and giving us an opportunity to speak on a very important and emotive debate.  It affects each of us in our constituencies and it is a very emotive subject for the people we represent.Everybody knows the best and cheapest way to run a health service is to have an effective and efficient acute hospital system that will treat patients in an effective and efficient manner, get them home and arrange home care packages to help them.  None the less, we have seen plans for a 4.5% reduction in the provision of home help.  This is a very retrograde step.  I know from having looked after an elderly neighbour in recent years that home help managed to keep this lady out of long-term residential care for 18 months.  Without that home help she would not have been able to stay out of care.  That home help had a net benefit, both to her from a social point of view in that she was able to stay longer in her home setting where she had lived for 82 years, and also as a cost benefit to the taxpayer because the lady had no means.  Her long-term residential care is now being met in full by the Exchequer.  The Minister should consider that.I wish to highlight the position at Mullingar regional hospital.  Last year, yet again, it was the most efficient hospital outside Dublin.  Now it is taking in additional patients from Roscommon hospital, which was downgraded in spite of the Minister's pledges, and from Navan.  Even though the hospital has taken in these additional patients, it has not received any additional funding.  Last year it took €60 million to run the hospital but this year's budget will be €56.4 million, to include an overrun of €1.9 million.  What happened to the notion of funding following the patient?  It is not happening in one of the most efficient hospitals in the country.The Minister talks about the difference-----

These are more than 20 people lying on trolleys tonight.  In 2010, Mullingar hospital lost 1,000 bed days to delayed discharges.  In 2011, the number almost trebled to 2,800.  That happened as a result of the Minister's failure with the fair deal scheme.  Patients are waiting months for approval under the scheme and they are taking up acute hospital beds while costing additional funds-----

It has been pointed out to him in the House and in the media that the figures Dr. Gerry Burke used originally were not accurate.  That has been accepted by most people and the Deputy should also be prepared to accept that the original figures were wrong.  In addition, he is being disingenuous because Dr. Burke was contacted earlier to find out what he thought about the arrangements and he replied, "Overall, I am happy with what is being planned but some further work will need to be done".  The Deputy, therefore, is aware of the situation.

As I said on previous occasions, I am conscious of the serious difficulties that have resulted for many patients because of the centralisation of medical card services and the level of service provided in recent times has not been acceptable.  A review of the services, processes and systems in the PCRS office is under way and we hope to have an outcome from that shortly.  Notwithstanding that, I have visited the PCRS on four different occasions recently, as has the Minister.  Senior officials form the HSE and the PCRS have been also called into the Department on a number of occasions.  We have engaged closely with the HSE to address the current position, which I acknowledge is not acceptable.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	749	It has not improved.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	750	I would like an opportunity to outline the improvements that were initiated recently.  The HSE has introduced a self-assessment system for all medical card holders aged over 66.  The system is also being introduced for people under the age of 66 who received a medical card on the basis of means.  We will have a system, therefore, under which people will be required to declare that their circumstances have not changed since they were awarded a medical card previously.  It is a straightforward form and if they do that, the medical card will be renewed automatically on a self-assessment basis.  In time, spot checks will be introduced but a self-assessment system has been put in place for more than 80% of people seeking medical card renewals.The HSE is standardising eligibility periods from two to three years for people aged under 66 while the period is being extended to four years for people aged over 66.  The executive is providing GPs with a facility to maintain the eligibility of vulnerable patients until their application has been completed.The issue of staff was raised.  An additional 20 staff were provided to the PCRS during January and this will greatly enhance the services available and enable the office to provide a better service to everybody.  With regard to emergency medical cards, there is now a facility whereby GPs can have an urgent medical card issued without delay once they have validated the application.  That service kicked in over the past few weeks.  I was concerned that problems were emerging with the appeals system.  However, additional staff were deployed in the appeals office, which has given an undertaking that the backlog will be addressed in the next month.While I do not dispute there have been serious difficulties, steps have been taken and I hope within the next few weeks to provide a full briefing to every Member of both Houses regarding those changes and regarding how they can interact more effectively with the PCRS to obtain details quickly regarding the concerns of their constituents.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I wish to share time with Deputy Cowen.I hope we continue to have reasoned and analytical debates on health issues because once one goes into government, one suddenly realises how complex is the health system, the huge input of people into it and the need to work incrementally to improve services.  The first thing that should be recognised is the huge improvement in health services, which has happened for many reasons, many of which are related to preventative measures.  People are living longer and much of that is not related to hospital provision but to better housing, nutrition and so on.  When debating people's health and well-being we should never lose sight of the extraneous factors that have a significant effect on how long they live and on their quality of life.If we could all get more citizens to quit smoking, for example, and to moderate alcohol use, we would solve more of the health problems in the country than all the debating in the House would ever do and we should not lose sight of that factor.  The Government will spend €12.5 billion on health services this year and the issue is how to obtain value for money.  I pay tribute to the vast number of people who work in our health system for their commitment and dedication.  The majority of health care workers do their best no matter what role they play.I also believe, however, that as human beings we resist change in our work practices, even when it would make the job easier and flexibilities would generate a better outcome.  It is human nature to initially resist change and it is, therefore, important that the Government uses the Croke Park agreement to bring about change in how health service staff work.  I recall when trying to introduce change in the company where I worked that I used to often say to employees that by using technology smartly, they could make the job easier.  One often was not asking people to work harder but to adopt change and new technology in order that their job would become easier and produce better results.Greater flexibility is needed in rostering and, in particular, in the use of expensive technology.  We can all work to make sure that expensive technology is used for many more hours in the week than it is used at present.The Minister on coming into office had the great idea of introducing universal health insurance.  One of the wisest things I was told by a management consultant, although I am not a big fan of such gurus, was that we were obsessed in this country with changing the structures and the names and that we would get much further a great deal faster if we tried to make the structures that we have work better.  We often waste a great deal of energy changing the structures and having all the same people working under some great new structure, but what we need is to make sure that the structures in place work better.There was a cogent argument for setting up a national health service as opposed to the health boards having regard to the idea of setting out objective service levels to which people are entitled, regardless of where they live.  Setting an objective service level taking into account resources and spreading them in order that everybody would get access to an even service is the sensible way forward.  An analysis of waiting times for the ambulance service will show that the waiting times vary dramatically between the old health board areas and it does not seem to have any particular relationship to the dispersal of the population but seems to have historic relationships.  This should all be standardised and no person regardless of where they live should have to wait longer than a certain time for the ambulance service.  That principle should apply to primary care services and to being seen by public health nurses.  There should not be uneven service levels that are historic where there is over-abundance in one area and deprivation in another.  The same principle should apply to home care packages, the home help service and community nursing homes in respect of which there is concern that many of them will be gathered, as it were, into big centres.Long before the granting of medical cards to people over the age of 70 I believed that when a person reached pension age the chances of his or her income increasing dramatically was very slight.  I could not understand why the health service could not follow the good example of the Revenue Commissioners in that when one is over the age of 66 and makes a tax return the Revenue Commissioners write a letter advising that there is no need for the person to make a further tax return unless contacted by the Revenue Commissioners who would only contact the person if they saw his or her name in the newspaper having won the lottery or some such thing.  Otherwise, they accept the position as outlined in the tax return.  The waste and worry caused in processing renewal applications from people who were 99.2% certain to have their card renewal was not worth a candle.  The Minister would be much better putting the same resources into ensuring that those who have variable incomes are means tested at a reasonable frequency and get quick decisions.I know the Minister was in Galway recently.  He will know that there are a number of issues that affect Galway in particular.

He know the issues and I know them.  One thing I cannot understand is what happened in Carna recently where people were given no warning; a service was discontinued and the equipment was ripped out one morning without any discussion with the local community.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	757	There are difficult issues facing this State and there were many difficult issues facing it when this Government assumed office 12 months ago.  It received a massive majority and was afforded great trust in seeking to resolve our difficulties.  The Government gave the distinct impression that not only would there be an easier way than the austerity of the previous Administration, on which it did a U-turn immediately on assuming office, but that it would overhaul the HSE and deliver a much improved health service.I will allow the Minister some more time than the one year which we are talking about today but not the ten years that he sought last night.  If the first year is anything to go by, we will not be enamoured by the next four either.  The health service is one which from 1997 to 2011 saw improvements, as many speakers have said, in tackling cancer and improving survival rates and similarly death rates from cardiovascular disease have fallen massively.  The health service had seen much capital investment across the regions such as that in my county in Offaly where there is a new state of the art hospital in Tullamore and community nursing units in Birr, Tullamore and Edenderry, which combined now face €22 million in cuts based on the service plan published yesterday.  The health service saw some 170,000 people treated under the National Treatment Purchase Fund up to 2010, with waiting times having been greatly reduced or eradicated in many instances.None of us under-estimates the various the challenges across Departments.  Many of us agree with the thrust of policy geared towards meeting our commitments to close our income and expenditure deficit over the period of the next three years.  Where we differ is on the specifics and the methods used to meet these commitments.  We all hope that whatever methodology is used is successful.  We all share the electorate's aspiration that this Dáil and even this Government will resolve our difficulties, chart a way out and attract investments for our youth.  We acknowledge, compliment and congratulate everybody concerned with yesterday's announcement in Dundalk.  We also acknowledge, compliment and congratulate everybody concerned with the visit of the Vice President of China to this country last week; we will now be allowed to exploit the great opportunities that exist between our two countries and we will flourish much more from that than they will.  Parallel to that, we must prioritise State services to care and provide for those most in need.Who is most in need in our society or in any society only the poor, the sick the aged and children.  We in Fianna Fáil would seek to prioritise health and education.  It is at that juncture that our shared aspirations evaporate.  It was budget 2012 that signalled this.  This Government in delivering that budget, for the first time made its own decisions and, most particularly, decided on its own priorities.  Since then as further details have emerged it is patently obvious to us and to all that education and health have suffered badly.  It is necessary for us to bring forward motions such as this, which highlights the crazy decisions, crazy choices and unbelievable priorities which are having such a devastating effect on those most in need.  We hope the Government will recognise its errors and will recognise, as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, said, that they are out of practice and out of touch-----

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	792	During 2009 it was determined that Anglo and INBS required additional capital. A commitment was provided by the Minister to Anglo and separately to INBS to provide capital of €8.3 billion and €2.7 billion, respectively. This capital was provided on 31 March 2010.In relation to Anglo, this €8.3 billion of capital was injected by way of a capital contribution. This capital contribution is treated as equity capital for regulatory capital purposes. In relation to INBS, a special investment share was acquired for €100 million in cash and a further €2.6 billion was subsequently injected by way of a capital contribution.The Government did not pay for these capital contributions in Anglo and INBS with cash. The Government effectively issued an IOU, in the form of Promissory Notes, to Anglo and INBS for €8.3 billion and €2.6 billion, respectively. As the State had a debt to the institutions, it also had an associated interest charge. The Bank prepares its financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). To comply with IFRS the Bank must recognise the Promissory Note initially at fair value. Subsequently, the Promissory Note is carried at amortised cost. Given fair value requirements this interest charge was set by reference to Government yields at the date of issue and was set to ensure that the fair value of the IOUs provided the full capital required.To do otherwise, or to set the coupon rate at a lower level would have meant that the fair value was lower than the par value of the Promissory Note with the result that the institutions' capital requirements would not have been satisfied.Subsequently, it was determined that Anglo and INBS needed additional capital, which was again provided by increasing the 31 March 2010 Promissory Notes. The final Promissory Note increase was on 31 December 2010 bringing the total Promissory Notes in Anglo and INBS to €30.6 billion. See table below for the increases:€ billionAngloINBSTotal (IBRC)31 March 20108.302.6010.9028 May 20102.00—2.0023 August 20108.58—8.5831 December 20106.422.709.1225.305.3030.60In each of the Promissory Note increases, the coupon was set by reference to Irish Government bond yields at the date of increase so as to ensure that the fair value of the Promissory Note increases provided the full amount of the additional capital required at those times. As a result, the differing tranches of Promissory Notes carry differing interest rates.When the final capital contribution was made on 31 December 2011 an interest holiday was inserted into each of the Promissory Notes which meant that between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 no interest was payable. Absent the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate on these Promissory Notes would have been 5.8%. However, as a result of the insertion of the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate from 1 January 2013 is c.8%.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	793	In the euro area, monetary policy — both standard and non-standard measures — is a matter for the European Central Bank, whose independence in this matter is enshrined in the Treaty. The issue of quantitative easing, therefore, does not fall within the domain of euro area Finance Ministers.  A resumption of strong economic growth will be key to resolving the debt issues to which the Deputy refers. Although the focus in Europe over the past number of years has been on repairing the financial system and the public finances, these are not sufficient conditions for a return to economic growth. Recognising this, the European Council in January agreed further efforts to promote growth and employment in the Union.The objective is to further modernise European economies and to strengthen competitiveness. The forthcoming Spring European Council will provide guidance on Member States economic and employment policies, putting emphasis on ‘green' growth and on accelerating structural reforms in order to improve the growth potential and enhance competitiveness.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is expected that around 226 Full Time Equivalent staff will have retired between January and the end of February 2012.  The estimated number of individuals (headcount) to retire is 251.  These numbers are subject to change as those who have indicated they intend to retire may change their mind before the end of February deadline. Others may choose to retire who have not already applied.The Revenue staff retiring are from across all locations and functional areas.The following Table 1 gives an indication of the locations from which Revenue staff are retiring.LocationRetirement HeadcountDublin120Limerick18Louth14Tipperary13Waterford13Galway10Donegal9Cork8Sligo8Clare7Cavan/Monaghan6Kerry5Offaly/Westmeath5Mayo5Wexford4Kilkenny3Kildare/Meath/Wicklow3The following Table 2 gives and indication of the functional areas of the retiring staff:Function AreaOperational (Collection/Debt Management/ Compliance/Customer Service)197Legislation and interpretation19Support (Planning/Corporate Services)19Information and Communications Technology and Logistics16The loss of so many skilled and experienced staff will undoubtedly impact on the service provided by Revenue.  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions in line with Government targets to reduce public service numbers.  However, I recognise the need to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue while meeting the existing Employment Control Framework allocations. An effective tax collection system is an essential element of our fiscal consolidation requirements and is critical to the successful achievement of the Government's objectives in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  In that context, I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to consider reducing Revenue's target staff numbers over a longer time period, whilst at the same time allowing Revenue to replace critical skills and experience.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities.Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.Neither the Central Bank nor I have any responsibility for any variation in the variable mortgage interest rates charged by the two institutions referred to by the Deputy. However the Central Bank has advised me that, within its existing powers, it will continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	796	On 16 March 2011 the European Commission, which has the right of initiative to bring forward legislative proposals, published its proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.  This represented the beginning of a process that will involve a detailed examination of the proposal, line by line, by all Member States at the Council Working Group.  Since the Commission's proposal has been published, Department of Finance officials, along with officials from the Revenue Commissioners have been attending the Working Party on Tax Questions which is the forum for discussions on the proposal.  To date, my officials have attended meetings on almost a monthly basis in relation to the proposal.It is expected that Ecofin will be presented with an update on the current state of play with regard to the negotiations at its meeting in May.Both I and the Government have made it clear that Ireland, like all other Member States, intend to actively engage in that process because only in that way can we absolutely ensure that all of the arguments are brought to the table.I want to assure the Deputy that it is clearly understood that our engagement is strictly on the basis that taxation is a matter of national competence and that the principle of unanimity in taxation is fully respected.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	797	I am advised by the Financial Services Ombudsman that from 2005 to date, the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau (FSOB) has received 39,264 complaints from individuals against Insurance Companies.  In that period, 17,138 complaints related to Insurance Products of which 819 are in relation to Mortgage Protection.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is an out of Court redress body that is free to the complaint. Therefore there is no cost to the consumer of making a complaint to the Ombudsman.Currently the FSOB does not identify Insurance Companies alleged to have defaulted on Mortgage Protection and or life or other insurance. There are  no statistics available on the reasons given for default. The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 provides that following a full investigation into a complaint and if the complaint is found to be wholly or partly substantiated, the Financial Services Ombudsman may direct the financial service provider to do one or more of the following:Rectify or change the conduct complained of or its consequences,Provide reasons or explanation for that conduct,Change that practice,Pay compensation up to a maximum of €250,000 or €26,000 annuity,Take any other lawful action.The FSOB may only make a direction in relation to the complaint at hand.  However, if an issue is systemic in nature then under Section 57CQ(2) of the Central Bank Act 2004 the Financial Services Ombudsman can make recommendations to the Central Bank that they address the problems that have been the source of the complaints.I should point out that the Financial Services Ombudsman is independent in the carrying out of his duties and that there is no role for me in the day to day workings of the office.The Deputy should be aware that I am currently considering the Financial Services Ombudsman's proposal about giving him the power to name, in certain circumstances, financial institutions that he has found to have acted unfairly. Once I have resolved certain legal issues identified, I will consider bringing appropriate proposals to Government. As the Deputy can appreciate this is a complex issue which requires detailed examination prior to bringing forward legislation. For example the criteria for publishing names would have to be identified in the legislation. Any amendment to the current legislation would need to be validated, justified and applied in an objective and reasonable manner to all financial institutions.

Copies of all of these reports have been provided to the Central Bank under the terms of a protocol for limited disclosure agreed between the parties to preserve legal privilege over the material.  A report has also been provided to the Garda in this regard.However, IBRC have been advised, given the on-going nature of the investigations by the Authorities as well as internal considerations within the bank, that the reports cannot legally be published at this time.  Publication of the reports may be considered when the Central Bank  proceedings are concluded, when any Garda investigation has been finalised (or any proceedings arising from such investigation concluded) and any civil proceedings contemplated by IBRC  either concluded or  otherwise disposed of.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	801	As the Deputy is aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets.  The banks have been set an overall target for lending to SMEs including farm lending. The Government is conscious that the agricultural sector, in common with other sectors, needs access to credit. The remit of the Credit Review Office which was established to review decisions of the banks to refuse credit explicitly includes farmers.All loans to farmers, including farm stocking loans, are included in the agriculture lending returns. Generally speaking, stocking loans are repaid in full and a new stocking loan is applied for the next season so it is appropriate that they are included in lending approvals.I am informed by Forfás that they do not have rules in relation to SME funding and have not suggested limits on the categories of bank lending.

Furthermore, the relevant conditions underpinning that investment dictate that, save in exceptional circumstances; no individual may receive, for a period of two years, aggregate remuneration (excluding pension contributions) of €500,000 per annum.The Government's bona fides in this area have been honoured by the remuneration packages agreed recently for the respective Chief Executive Officer positions at AIB and Permanent Trustee Savings Bank being contained within these parameters.As I have said previously, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions and have committed to placing the details underpinning the review into the public domain.

Persons operating as illegal moneylenders are in breach of the law.  It is a matter for An Garda Siochana to investigate their activities.  Under Section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (as amended), An Garda Siochana have sole responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of such offences. The Central Bank has no powers in this regard.  If the Bank has reason to believe that a person is operating as an illegal moneylender the matter is reported to An Garda Siochana.

Work on the process to appoint an Assessor is under way in my Department. I would also note that in considering the appropriate approach to filling the position of Assessor I will have regard to best practice internationally on such matters. It is likely, in this context, that the appointment of the Assessor will involve a competitive tendering process.The preference shares backing the securities issued by the firm referred to in the Parliamentary Question were acquired by the Minister for Finance upon the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc. in January 2009. The preference shares remain outstanding and in the Minister's ownership.There have been representations from a number of sources in relation to the appointment of the assessor including from legal firms representing the relevant Firm.Finally, the number of bonds that have been redeemed at 100% face value by IBRC since nationalisation  is 155.

The Government Programme is clear in its commitments in relation to tax policy and these were reflected in Budget 2012.The most recent Memorandum of Understanding (10th February 2012) proposes a budget for 2013 to include revenue measures to raise at least €1.25 billion (inclusive of carryover from 2012) and my Department is planning on that basis.

The existence of a retention agreement between IBRC and the company referred to in the question came to be in the public domain firstly, as far as I am aware, through a Parliamentary Question asked by Deputy Adams on Thursday 9th February.  The Bank subsequently responded to media queries on the matter.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I would not agree with the conclusion outlined above. Ireland's Programme  of external support, which is a three year programme designed to return us to market based financing is on track.  We are meeting our targets under the Programme and continuing to do so is the best means of ensuring that we emerge successfully from this programme. A substantial number of actions — over 90 — have already been completed. The Budgetary outturn for 2011 was well within the target set by the Troika.  The 5th and most recent EU/IMF review mission of Ireland was completed successfully and I look forward to the successful completion of the overall review process.In addition the cost of the banking measures under the Programme has been significantly lower than initially envisaged.  The imposition of burden sharing on unsecured subordinated bondholders has been an important element in this cost reduction.The reduction in our programme funding costs further supports these actions. These reductions, arising from changes to the costs of both the EU and IMF funding, amount to some €10 billion over the initially envisaged 7.5 year average term of the programme.The purpose of the EU/IMF Programme for Ireland is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place. Based on current projections and assuming no market access, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.Our strong programme performance is reflected in the continuing reduction in our bond yields.  This is essential to achieve the NTMA's stated intention of returning to sovereign debt markets as soon as market conditions permit.Market sentiment toward Ireland has also improved. Ireland has maintained its credit rating at a time when a number of euro area countries were downgraded in 2012. Irish bond yields have improved considerably. In recent days, the 10-year bond yield has gone below 7% which is a considerable reduction from the 14.1% peak in July 2011.  The National Treasury Management Agency has re-engaged with the bond market and extended some €3.5 billion of debt maturing just after the programme ends. This is a significant first step in terms of managing Ireland's post programme funding requirements. These developments can be directly related to our strong programme implementation.

This new programme provides a comprehensive blueprint for putting the public finances and the economy of Greece back on a sustainable footing and hence for safeguarding financial stability in Greece and in the euro area as a whole.  I see this as a very positive development; resolving the difficulties in Greece is one of the key elements of the five-point plan agreed by Heads of State or Government last October in order to address the difficulties in the euro area.In terms of main details, the second programme for Greece will involve additional official financing of €130 billion over the period to 2014 subject, of course, to strict policy conditionality.  The involvement of the private sector through a voluntary nominal haircut of 53.5 per cent on its holdings of Greek government bonds is a key element.  A number of measures to strengthen monitoring and implementation are envisaged.

IBRC has retained the services of the "strategic advisory arm" of the company referred to in the question which has been validated as independent of the "investment arm" of the Group.IBRC can confirm that FTI Consulting's UK practice provided independent advice to the Bank in relation to the appointment of the ‘strategic advisory arm' of the company referred to in the question. This was designed to ensure that no conflict of interest arises for IBRC in retaining the services of the company referred to in the question in this regard. FTI Consulting's US practice provided a similar role in the Bank's successful sale of its US loan portfolios which concluded recently to ensure that the process was open, fair and transparent and that established procedures were followed.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	812	The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Government, therefore, has established a Steering Group, on which the Central Bank is represented, to oversee and drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears across Government.  Significant progress has already been achieved across a number of the individual work areas including the publication of a draft Personal Insolvency Bill by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence and the announcement of the first "mortgage to rent" transaction by the Minister for Housing and Planning.   The Central Bank, both from a consumer protection and prudential regulation perspective, has a very significant role to play in addressing the problem of mortgage arrears.  With regard to consumers in arrears or in danger of going into financial difficulty and/or concerned about going into mortgage arrears, the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) offers increased protections to these consumers.  This revised code builds on the provisions of the previous version, but includes more detailed requirements, including the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Other examples of significant changes are:pre-arrears cases must be treated in accordance with the MARP;arrears have been defined;the primary residences which can be protected by the CCMA have been defined; andan Appeals process under the CCMA replaces the complaints process under the Consumer Protection Code.The Central Bank has also published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears "Mortgage Arrears — A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender" and this is available on the Central Bank website:—http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection/ documents/consumer%20booklet%20-%20final%20feb%202011.pdf.
With regard to monitoring compliance with the consumer protection codes, the Central Bank carries out themed inspections and mystery-shopping exercises.  In July 2011, the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with the requirement of the revised CCMA specifically relating to charges on mortgage accounts in arrears, and the related Letter of Direction (‘Direction').  The Direction instructed mortgage lenders to refrain from imposing interest surcharge on arrears and other specific charges arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which the revised CCMA applies and in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the MARP from 1 January 2011.  Provision 9 of the CCMA refers to the restriction from imposing such charges.  Lenders were individually notified of the charges to which this Provision applies in the individual Direction that issued in December 2010.  This themed inspection was carried out across six mortgage lenders including credit institutions and retail credit firms.  655 customer mortgage account statements were reviewed during the course of the themed inspection.  A further direction was issued to lenders in December 2011 restricting some further charges.  Further detail can also be found on the Central Bank website: http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankMonitorsLendersCompliancewiththeRevisedCode.aspx.
In addition, in October 2011 the Central Bank required each mortgage lender to develop strategies and implementation plans to deal with their individual mortgage arrears situations.  The Central Bank is currently reviewing the strategies as submitted and is examining the plans of lenders to offer appropriate longer term solutions, such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group report and other options that banks may develop themselves, for their customers who may have unsustainable mortgages.  The Central Bank is continuing to engage with lenders on the further development and implementation of these plans.

Neither the Department nor the NTMA were given notice of the retention agreement before the agreement was signed. My officials were notified as part of the on-going communications with the bank. My officials sought assurances from the bank that no conflict of interest existed in relation to the appointment and these assurances were provided by the Chairman of the bank. I am satisfied, on the basis of information and assurances provided to my Department that proper procedures were followed and that no conflict exists. Again, I would ask the deputy if he has information to the contrary to please bring such information to my attention so that the matters can be investigated and resolved.

These amounts are published monthly. The Central Bank cannot disclose the financial institutions that avail of such support, nor does it disclose the terms on which this support is given. ELA is one of the ways that the Central Bank has responded to the financial crisis. This is distinct and separate from regular funding operations carried out for monetary policy implementation purposes through the ECB. A loan provided to a credit institution under ELA is granted against suitable collateral, where suitability is in line with unpublished criteria defined by the Central Bank. Further details on ELA are available in the Central Bank Annual Report for 2010 which is available on their website. I can refer the Deputy in particular to note 1(v) and Note 20(iii) on pages 93 and 104 respectively.

It is possible that this company could be meeting my Department or the NTMA on a whole range of issues. I have assumed for the purpose of replying to this question that the Deputy is referring to meetings with the company relating to IBRC.    In this context there have been weekly meetings/conference calls with my Department since December 16, 2011. My own diary indicates that the Taoiseach and I met with the company referred to in the question on 8 November 2011. The matter of the IBRC retention agreement did not arise. The NTMA have informed me that no meeting in relation to, or concerning, the retention agreement with IBRC took place in the relevant period.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	817	Legislation governing the regulation of charities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence.  However, a tax exemption for charities is available under Section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The administration of this tax exemption is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am advised by Revenue that to avail of the exemption a body must be established for charitable purposes and must apply all of its income for charitable purposes only.  While for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue cannot comment on the tax affairs of individual charities they have informed me that they have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that the initial application for charitable tax exemption by each charitable body meets the necessary criteria for such exemption. Revenue has also confirmed that bodies that are granted charitable tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused reviews to ensure that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled. All relevant matters are taken into consideration in the context of such reviews.   The Financial Regulator has no role in the matter.As the deputy may be aware, in certain financial transactions it is common practice internationally for the shares in special purpose companies (SPCs) to be owned by a public charity. In an Irish context, a typical structure for an orphan company would consist of the establishment of an Irish private limited company (i.e. the SPC), the entire issued share capital of which is held on trust for charitable purposes.  The trustee holders of the share capital can be individuals or nominee shareholder companies (charitable trust companies).  All of these hold their shareholding under declaration of trust executed in favour of a charity.These structures are not tax-driven nor does Irish tax law in any way enable tax evasion. These structures clearly serve specific commercial purposes.  As the SPC is not consolidated into the balance sheet of the financial institution ("the originator") that has transferred loans to the SPC, the originator can now make further loans and is no longer liable for any non-performing loans included in the assets transferred to the SPC.  Furthermore, any credit risk of the originator is isolated from the underlying assets so that the investor's investment decision regarding the issued securities is based solely on the anticipated asset-performance.  The issued debt of the SPC may thus achieve a higher credit-rating than the originator's own debt would have achieved.The charity is a shareholder in the company and does not hold any assets or liabilities.  All assets and liabilities are held by the SPC.  It is the company, not the charity, which carries on the business — and funds are not channelled through the charity.  Instead, any residual profits left in the SPC after its business is completed are paid by way of dividend to the charitable trust.  SPCs are not entitled to any tax deduction for the payment of such dividends.  It is likely that the total amount of residual dividends they pay, being incidental to the main business, is relatively small.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 39 together.The Strategic Investment Fund (SIF), whose establishment was announced by the Government in September 2011, will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF)  towards productive investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private investors. It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs. The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.The involvement of the NPRF in the SIF is expected to require the amendment of the investment policy of the NPRF, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, as the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	819	The position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that the Government has now fulfilled its commitment contained in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in the period 2004 to 2008.   Statistics from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government show that national average house prices (including apartments) rose significantly in the period 2004 to 2008, reaching a peak in the second quarter of 2007.  I believe that people who purchased during this period would most benefit from an increase in mortgage interest relief. I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  Under the current tax legislation mortgage interest relief is granted from the date the first mortgage interest payment is made.  The legislation is being amended in the Finance Bill for this particular measure to also include mortgage draw-down as a qualifying event for the rate increase.  This means that a mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or   if they drew down their mortgage in that period.Therefore, an individual who drew down their mortgage in December 2003 but made their first mortgage interest repayment in 2004 will qualify for the increased relief.  Also, an individual who drew down their mortgage in December 2008 but did not make their first mortgage repayment until 2009 will also qualify.I do not have costs available for extending the period beyond the period 2004-2008 set out in the Programme for Government. In advance of the Budget I considered the rates which were outlined in the Programme for Government.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	820	As the deputy is aware, in response to the Nyberg report and with regard to the restructuring of the banking sector, I stated that:
“A programme of rotation of board members, commencing with board members appointed before September 2008, will be expected to be part of the plan. This should apply to both Executive and Non Executive Board members and provides a process to ensure a smooth succession of incumbent board members who were in place before September 2008.  I would expect this succession to be substantially completed by early 2012, and will use my powers as shareholder to affect such changes if necessary”.
Across the financial institutions covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, only 4 of the 74 board members in place in September 2008 remain in place. Only two of the fifteen board members of Bank of Ireland as at 30 September 2008 are current board members of the bank, Mr Richie Boucher and Mr Jerome Kennedy. Furthermore pursuant to an RNS communication issued by Bank of Ireland dated 23 December 2011, Mr Kennedy has indicated his intention to retire as a non executive director at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.I also stated that:
“Steps would be taken to ensure that the skills and competence levels of senior managers are fully adequate to the demands of the current situation and the planned future of the Irish banking system”.

The Central Bank may refuse to approve a proposed appointment to a PCF role where it is of the opinion that the proposed appointee is not of such fitness and probity as is appropriate to perform the relevant function. Where the Central Bank refuses to approve a proposed appointment, then a regulated financial service provider may not appoint the person to the role.Further, the Central Bank as part of its role in the on-going supervision of the financial services sector, including the banking industry, may from time to time consider that there is reason to suspect the fitness and probity of any person performing a controlled function and may commence an investigation into that person. The existence and progress of such investigations are confidential and details of such investigations may not be disclosed by the Central Bank.  As previously announced, the Central Bank is reviewing the position of executive and non-executive directors of covered institutions that received state support and who are remaining in director posts after 1 January 2012 to decide whether or not an investigation into any of those persons might be appropriate. This process provides opportunities for persons to make representations to independent decision makers appointed by the Central Bank. The Central Bank does not comment on individual cases.All assessments of fitness and probity of persons being proposed to PCF roles, and of persons performing controlled functions are made with respect to the criteria set out in Section 25(3) of the Act and a Code issued by the Central Bank under Section 50 of the Act entitled "Fitness and Probity Standards (Code issued under Section 50 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010).
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	821	There is a huge amount of uncertainty at the moment, as evidenced by the wide range of GDP projections for this year, not just for Ireland, but also for the euro area. Obviously as a small open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, we are affected by the slowdown in growth in Europe, though competitiveness improvements evidenced in recent years will provide some support.  A weakening of activity in our main trading partners is already factored into the Department of Finance forecasts for economic growth that underpin the Budget. Given the highly uncertain environment, the Budget documentation pointed to a number of risks to this forecast — some to the downside and some to the upside. These risks are all still valid.However, while the weak external outlook is of concern, there have also been some positive developments since Budget time, not least favourable exchange rate movements which will provide some benefit to the exporting sector. In addition, I would point out that some of the economic data — domestically and internationally — have not been as poor as some were assuming. For example, high frequency survey data show that economic activity and confidence in the euro area improved in January, while in Germany, the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment showed a strong increase which raised the indicator to positive territory for the first time since May 2011. At home, new export orders are continuing to expand, with car sales also showing some improvement in January.

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on the placing or easing of lending restrictions in individual cases.  I believe that such action would represent interference in the work of the independent regulator.The Registrar of Credit Unions advises me that he has put lending restrictions in place in order to protect the savings of members in credit unions and to ensure that credit unions focus on risks when making lending decisions. Restrictions are imposed on a case-by-case basis and are reviewed regularly.  The Registrar has advised that each credit union will be aware of its individual position.  In general, in relation to those credit unions that have sought an easing in lending restrictions, the Registrar has advised that lending restrictions can be lifted or eased if a credit union can demonstrate an improvement in its financial position and that it would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases. The type of lending restrictions can include maximum individual loan size, overall maximum monthly lending limits and restrictions on business lending.

These amounts are published monthly. The Central Bank cannot disclose the financial institutions that avail of such support although it is open to all eligible counterparties to apply for such funding. ELA is one of the ways that the Central Bank has responded to the financial crisis. This is distinct and separate from regular funding operations carried out for monetary policy implementation purposes through the ECB. A loan provided to a credit institution under Exceptional Liquidity Assistance is granted against suitable collateral, where suitability is in line with unpublished criteria defined by the Central Bank. As with procedures for ECB eligible collateral, appropriate haircuts/discounts are applied with a view to ensuring that the Central Bank would not suffer any loss in the event of default on the loan assistance. The Bank has received formal comfort from me as Minister for Finance such that any shortfall on the liquidation of the collateral will be made good. Further details on ELA is available in the bank's Annual Report for 2010 in Note 1(v) and Note 20(iii) on pages 93 and 104 respectively.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The interim accounts published by the bank for the 6 months ended 30 June 2011, which are the latest published figures, shows a total liability figure of €50,677 million. In effect this is the amount required to pay off its liabilities in full. In addition a further €3,404 million represents the State's equity in the institution.  If one assumes that the assets will cover some of the liabilities, even in a worst case scenario it would not be unreasonable to expect that the full €47 billion might not be required.  That said, the Deputy will appreciate that much of the further information requested in the  question is subject to external factors and that it is not practical to be definitive in terms of timelines or costs at this point. Suffice to say that the Board of the bank is charged with the work-out of the bank's assets in a manner that will best protect the interests of the State.However, the framework within which the bank is operating is set out in the EU Commission Decision on the restructuring plan which issued on 29.6 2011. The link below provides access the redacted version of the Decision.IBRC is working to generate options for the efficient work out of its loan books in accordance with the Bank's approved mandate. This includes examining accelerated disposal where this makes economic sense. Following the timely sale of the majority of the Bank's US loan portfolios, the bank now continues with further detailed analysis of the remaining loans in Ireland and the UK. This analysis will further inform the Board and management team of IBRC on the timing of the next phases of deleveraging. The exact value of its remaining loans will be reported in the Banks annual report and accounts which are due for release next month. The final cost of rescuing the institution is estimated to be within the current capital provided by the State and will predominately be a function of the property markets in Ireland and the UK together with the availability of counterparty liquidity to enable further disposals by way of recoveries, repayments and sales. It will also depend on the outcome of any negotiations on the promissory note between the Government and the EU that are still under way. The estimated timeframe for the resolution of the institution is currently nine years as detailed in the Bank's approved restructuring plans. http://ec.europa.eu/competition/stateaid/cases/239466/2394661251121213.pdf

The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the maturity of the notes, the interest rate, the cash flows etc.  In tandem with this technical review the Government has commenced a campaign at political level to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State. I have met with Commissioner Rehn and Mario Draghi President of the European Central bank as well as a number of my counterparts from Member States to progress the matter. However, I did not attend the EU summit on 30 January.  Additional detail on such proposals will be available when the on-going work is further advanced.

However, it would not at all be appropriate for me to unilaterally instruct the Central Bank, and the Troika that the scheduled payment will not be made, at a time when we are engaged in a process to review options in relation to the reduction in the overall burden to the State of restructuring our banking sector in terms of either or both the cost and the timing of the repayment of that debt.Further, I am not convinced that in the event that it may be deemed advisable to make the Promissory Note payment due under the current schedule in March that it will weaken or position in the on-going review.  It is simply not my experience, or the experience of the Government, that is the way things work within the European Union or the Eurozone. I would remind the Deputy that our external partners are engaging in these discussions notwithstanding that a payment of €3.06bn has already been made in March 2011.The technical group, involving the Troika representatives, will look at a range of options for reengineering the Promissory Note and the funding of IBRC and the Deputy will appreciate the necessity and appropriateness of waiting on the outcome of that process.  While it would certainly be beneficial to have the matter of the Promissory Note payments resolved and agreed by the end of March there is no guarantee that this will be achieved in that timeframe. The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of parties involved directly and indirectly in this process. The Deputy will also appreciate the situation in the Eurozone remains unsettled and is changing on a daily basis. In this environment and given the nature of advocacy and the decision making process in the EU I would not expect this matter to be concluded quickly. However, I can assure the Deputy that everything that can be done will be done to ensure a positive outcome for the State.

In July 2011 €2.3 billion of this requirement was injected by way of a placing of shares to the Minister for Finance, leaving the Minister with his current holding of 99.24%. At this time a further €400 million was also injected into the company in return for a Contingent Capital note bringing the total State contribution to €2.7 billion. In addition the company also raised €0.2bn from internal capital raising measures. While the company also completed a liability management exercise which generated additional core tier 1 capital this did not improve the bank's overall capital position due to the existing capital treatment of its investment in the subsidiary Life Company. After all of these actions the remaining capital requirement for the company is €1.3bn.  It was intended that the remaining capital requirement would be satisfied on completion of a successful disposal of a major subsidiary, with any shortfall provided by the State. However the sale was postponed on 25th November 2011 due to the extreme levels of volatility being experienced in the eurozone at that time.Following the suspension of this sale process, we have decided that a government purchase of the subsidiary company will be the most effective mechanism to finalise the recapitalization of the company by 30 June 2012. The subsidiary is a valuable asset for the State and will continue to be managed on an independent commercial basis to ensure that value, and we will continue to work to dispose of it as soon as market conditions permit.Any capital shortfall after the State has acquired the subsidiary will be met by the State.The Government Budget 2012 projections include an allowance for the provision of the €1.3bn capital in June 2012.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	831	As announced in my Budget speech, I am introducing significant enhancements to the R&D tax credit scheme in Finance Bill 2012 as we need to encourage the productive, high value-added sectors of our economy in order to work our way out of the current downturn.  Up to now, sub-contracted R&D costs in respect of payments made to unconnected persons have been eligible for the tax credit to the extent that they did not exceed 10% of the expenditure incurred by the company itself on research and development activities. In the case of payments made to third level institutions in the European Economic Area for undertaking R&D the limit was 5%. These limits had the effect of disproportionately affecting smaller companies who may have greater need to outsource R&D work than larger multinationals with greater internal resources. The outsourcing limits for sub-contracted R&D costs have been increased to the greater of 5 or 10% as appropriate or up to €100k. This will provide a targeted benefit to SMEs.As regards the Deputy's suggestion to include a requirement that the R&D be sourced from indigenous companies or universities, this would bring the R&D tax credit scheme into conflict with EU State-aid rules. It has been a deliberate policy to avoid EU State-aid complications by maintaining the R&D tax credit scheme as a general measure which does not favour one form of domestic company over another or discriminates in an unfair way against companies or universities in other EU Member States. For these reasons I do not propose to include the requirement suggested.

I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters.  These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, the bank is run on a commercial arm's length basis as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  In relation to costs incurred, the management and board of the institution are aware of their duties to their shareholders to ensure that all costs incurred by the bank are necessary and reflect the needs of the business.Separately, I am informed by the Bank that in line with its normal practice, the bank has not publicly disclosed the specific contract details in respect of this firm as they deem such information to be commercially sensitive in respect of arrangements entered into with individual firms. The bank has however confirmed that the firm in question continues to provide AIB with consultancy services and the bank has further indicated that it remains committed to managing the cost of, and maximising the value from, this arrangement.

Therefore, from 2016 onwards, we will be required to meet (or be making sufficient progress towards) our medium term (budgetary) objective — the so-called MTO.  The MTO is a target that is set for the structural fiscal position (i.e. adjusting the public finances for the impact of the economic cycle) that takes into account the level of debt as well as implicit liabilities associated with the ageing of the population. In terms of the speed of consolidation towards the MTO, work at EU level is ongoing and it is expected that the Commission will provide clarity on the time-frame for convergence, taking into consideration country-specific sustainability risks, that participating Member States will be required to respect.The structural balance is not possible to measure directly and must be estimated.  However, the applicability of the "one size fits all" approach currently used to determine the structural fiscal position in an Irish context has been raised with the Commission in the past.  Further discussions will be undertaken, including as part of the revisions to the country-specific medium term objectives being undertaken this year.Leaving aside the methodological considerations, it should be remembered that estimates of the structural balance in 2015 are not fixed — policies that may be implemented by Government in the intervening period can be expected to have a bearing on the figure.  Taking account of this fact, it is clear that it is difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty the scale of any further adjustments that may be needed in the post-2015 period.For instance, microeconomic reforms (which are a key part of the EU/IMF programme) that help to address some of the skills mis-match in the labour market could help lower the "equilibrium" unemployment rate with a structurally beneficial impact on the public finances (on both the revenue and expenditure sides) — in other words, the structural fiscal position could improve with reforms.In this context, the Government's recently announced action plan for jobs, which is designed to significantly improve employment over the next number of years, will alter the outlook in the future.  This should impact positively on the amount of fiscal adjustment that may be required.In summary, there are lots of moving parts and therefore, the speed and scale of additional consolidation post-2015 must be seen in this context. However, what is clear is that in order to continue to restore sustainability to our public finances, Ireland's budgetary position will — for the foreseeable future — have to be in balance or in surplus in structural terms.

As the Deputy knows, the regulation of derivatives has been part of our discussions with the EU and has been on the Ecofin agenda since September 2010 when the Commission published its proposal to regulate this market in the context of over-the-counter (OTC) trades. I can inform the Deputy that, following discussions, agreement on a final text has now been reached with all of the EU institutions, subject to final technical details being clarified.  The scope of this draft Regulation covers all over-the-counter derivatives, not just food securities.  In relation to derivatives traded on exchanges, as I indicated in my reply to the Deputy in early February, Ireland already has a regulatory regime which comes from the 2004 EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which is currently being reviewed.The work on both OTC derivatives and the MiFID review is expected to result in a tighter regime for all derivatives, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. The measures are intended to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, and in line with G20 commitments.  When finalised, these EU legislative initiatives will come into force in all Member States. The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority in this country for the purposes of derivatives legislation.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	837	The Deputy is aware that the published Memorandum of Understanding of 10th February 2012 proposes a budget for 2013 to include revenue measures to raise at least €1.25 billion (inclusive of carryover from 2012); these measures to include a broadening of the personal income tax base, a restructuring of motor taxation, a reduction in general tax expenditures and an increase in excise duty and other indirect taxes. Without prejudice to the minimum consolidation amount referred to above and in consultation with the staff of the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, the Government may substitute one or more of the above measures with others of equally good quality based on the options identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.   In my Budget 2012 Statement, I highlighted a number of areas that would be considered for revenue base-broadening in 2013. These included a commencement of a consultation process with the motor industry and other interested parties to review options for VRT and Motor Tax, flagging the broadening of the PRSI base to cover rental, investment and other forms of income and the further reform of the tax treatment of supplementary pension provision. However, the Deputy will also be aware that it is not the practice of the Minister for Finance to discuss the precise or specific details of measures which may be under consideration as part of a future Budget and Finance Bill package.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	838	The reports from Professor Patrick Honohan, Messrs Regling and Watson and the Nyberg Commission identified that poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis and set out the problems that needed to be addressed in the banking regulation area.   The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 provides for new powers to be exercised by the Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. The new fitness and probity regime is being rolled out by the Central Bank through regulations that were published on 1 September 2011 and is being introduced on a phased basis. The Regulations were applied to Pre-Approval Controlled Functions from 1 December 2011 and will apply to persons appointed to Controlled Functions from 1 March 2012 (other than Pre-Approval Controlled Functions).Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 was published in July 2011. The bill enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad, and strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The bill also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 is expected to commence committee stage in the Dáil shortly.The Central Bank advises me that its regulatory activity has intensified with increases in staff numbers and skill levels. At the end of 2010 the Central Bank employed 1,226 which represents an increase of 17.4% on 2009 staffing levels. There has being a significant increase in on-site inspections and review meetings have gone from 606 in 2009 to 1,046 in 2010.  The Central Bank has published an Enforcement Strategy for 2011-2012 setting out its strategic approach to enforcement for the benefit of consumers and the integrity of the Irish financial services sector.  The Central Bank has also taken a number of measures under its "Banking Supervision — our new approach" to banking supervision which they introduced in June 2010 and updated in June 2011.  During 2011 the Central Bank has re-organised its internal banking supervision structures.  The Central Bank has invested heavily in training all supervisory staff.  A panel of risk advisors with specialist and industry expertise has been in operation since September 2010.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	839	As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.The CRO applies to AIB and Bank of Ireland. SMEs, sole traders or farmers can apply for a review where credit is refused, withdrawn, or offered on unreasonable conditions. Banks have set up formal internal review processes, which must first examine an appeal by a customer. Ulster Bank has also set up an internal appeal process. The CRO ensures that the banks do not refuse credit to viable businesses, both by its existence and by offering the right to a review of refusals.On 4 November last the Central Bank published a revised statutory Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME Code) setting out new requirements for lenders when dealing with SMEs in, or facing, financial difficulties which came into effect from 1 January 2012. A full review of the SME Code will be undertaken in 2012.The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation brought the draft heads of a Loan Guarantee Scheme Bill to Government on 24 November last. The Scheme will provide a partial guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs. This Scheme will be closely targeted at commercially viable, well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services which can demonstrate repayment capacity for the additional credit facilities but which cannot secure credit facilities due to either of the following two market failures: insufficient collateral for the additional facilities; or growth / expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.The Government has also approved the establishment of a Micro Finance Loan Fund to provide loans on a commercial basis for start-up businesses and micro-enterprises. It is expected that the businesses that will primarily benefit will be those at the margins of commercial lending decisions. The Scheme will use an initial exchequer investment of €10 million to leverage further funds from private sources. Over a ten year period, the scheme has the potential to provide up to €100 million in additional lending to over 5000 micro-enterprises over that period. The Scheme will be demand-led and the amount of funds provided will depend on the demand from viable businesses.As the Deputy knows, I published the independent Mazars survey of SME credit late last year. On foot of this report, a series of seven regional meetings with local representatives is now under way, hosted by the Minister for Small Business, John Perry T.D., supported by Mr. John Moran, Head of Banking in the Department of Finance. The aim of these meetings is to examine further the actions which might be taken by the Government to improve access to credit for SMEs.

The main item for discussion was the draft of a possible Protocol VI to the Convention relating to cluster munitions.    Ireland's position on a possible Protocol VI was clearly expressed at the Review Conference and at the meetings of the Group of Governmental Experts in advance of the Conference. We saw value in an instrument that would impose strong and binding legal commitments on states not currently in a position to become party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions that currently possess and/or produce such munitions. We were prepared to negotiate in good faith on an instrument that would be compatible with and complementary to the Convention on Cluster Munitions agreed in Dublin under our chairmanship in 2008 which would add value and make a difference in reducing civilian casualties in future armed conflicts. We would only have acceded to such an instrument if these conditions were met.My officials worked hard with a group of like-minded states to improve the text of the draft under discussion in Geneva. However, it did not prove possible to reach consensus on the draft and no vote was taken.It is not likely that negotiations on a Protocol on Cluster Munitions will resume in the CCW framework in the immediate future. Ireland will continue to promote the full implementation and universalisation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and looks forward to the fulfilment of our role, in conjunction with the Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic, as the Convention's Co-ordinator on Clearance.

The opening of the Embassy coincided with the decision to designate Malawi as a priority country for the aid programme, with a commitment to the provision of long term strategic assistance.The table below sets out the annual funding levels for the aid programme in Malawi since 2008.  It also provides information on the number of Irish and permanent locally-recruited staff, who plan, manage, monitor, evaluate and audit the aid programme.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	843	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 to 64, inclusive, together.As stated in my reply to Question No. 138 on 21 February 2012, Human Rights are, and have always been, a priority of successive Irish Governments and a central part of our foreign policy. Ireland attaches considerable importance to the vital work of human rights defenders and condemns all acts or threats of violence against organisations and individuals working to protect human rights. Ireland, along with our partners in the EU, is committed to promoting human rights and to eliminating torture and mistreatment of prisoners. The EU makes detailed representations regularly in response to executions, extrajudicial killings, arrests of human rights activists and restrictions on freedom of expression.In 2004, during Ireland's Presidency of the EU, a set of EU Guidelines for the protection of Human Rights Defenders were formulated. Our Presidency gave us the unique opportunity to bring the issue of Human Rights Defenders centre stage. The guidelines ensure that EU Missions outside the EU monitor, report, and assess the situation of Human Rights Defenders. They outline the steps required to ensure that pressure on the relevant authorities, where necessary, remains high. Ireland is also currently a member of the EU Human Rights Working Group's Task Force on Human Rights Defenders, which looks at practical ways of implementing the Guidelines and making them more effective.At the United Nations, Ireland has committed to support Human Rights Defenders in line with the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. This Declaration was adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly in 1998, and it remains the normative basis for international efforts for human rights defenders. Ireland has consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly to ensure human rights defenders can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.  Ireland actively promotes the work of Human Rights Defenders at the Human Rights Council. We have acted as burden sharer on behalf of the European Union to secure the renewal of the special procedures mandate for Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights Defenders and on resolutions which ensure that the spirit of the 1998 Declaration on Human Rights Defenders is adhered to.The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has accumulated a substantial body of commitments in the fields of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The participating States of the OSCE have long recognised the importance of Human Rights Defenders in helping States to meet the human rights standards to which they have committed. The recognition of civil society and the role NGOs play in promoting respect for human rights was first reflected in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and has been reaffirmed since then in many OSCE commitments.  Specific commitments in relation to Human Rights Defenders were first made in 1994, when participating States emphasised the need for their protection.In 2007, a "Focal Point on Human Rights Defenders and National Human Rights Institutions" was created within the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). The Focal Point runs training for human rights defenders aimed at developing monitoring and advocacy skills and supports the development of networks of human rights defenders.  In my capacity as Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE in 2012, I am committed to ensuring that the OSCE supports Human Rights Defenders in the most effective way, and will explore the opportunities for strengthening OSCE engagement, within the limitations imposed by consensus decision-making in the OSCE.I am aware of the cases of Mr. Dilmurod Saidov of Uzbekistan and Mr. Azimjan Askarov, an ethnic-Uzbek in Kyrgyzstan.Mr. Saidov, an independent Uzbek journalist and member of the Ezgulik Human Rights Organisation, who has written about corruption and abuse of power by local officials, and about social and economic problems in the Samarkand region, was sentenced to twelve-and-a-half years imprisonment in a closed trial in 2009, on charges of extortion and forgery. At the time of the trial, the OSCE Representative of the Freedom of the Media wrote to the Uzbek Foreign Minister expressing alarm at the extremely harsh sentence, following a trial which did not meet international standards of fair procedure. I welcome Uzbekistan's commitment to pursue numerous reforms in the Universal Periodic Review procedure of the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2009 and urge the Uzbek authorities to review his case.Mr. Azimjan Askarov has received a life sentence in prison on charges of organizing mass disorder, inciting inter-ethnic hatred, hostage-taking, and incitement to murder during violence in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010.  Concerns have been expressed regarding over-reliance on police evidence, and the failure of the authorities to adequately address the intimidation of defence witnesses and lawyers, to consider exculpatory evidence, and to effectively follow-up on indications of possible torture.  Concerns have also been expressed about Mr. Askarov's health. On 20 December 2011, Ambassador Janez Lenarcic, the Director of ODIHR, expressed dismay over a Supreme Court decision to uphold the life sentence imposed by lower courts, referring to the serious violations of Askarov's right to a fair trial. In a statement released on 22 December, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navi Pillay, said it was particularly alarming that the Supreme Court judges had failed to consider claims that confessions had been extracted under duress. On 10 January 2012, the EU delegation in Kyrgyzstan issued a statement calling upon the Kyrgyz authorities to consider all possible ways to re-examine the case of Mr. Askarov and his co-defendant, noting reports of serious violations of legal procedures. I have been closely monitoring this case in recent weeks and we have communicated our concerns to the Government of Kyrgyzstan. I hope that the new Government will give the case the most careful consideration.

I therefore welcomed the publication of the report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry and the significant steps taken by the Bahraini authorities to implement the recommendations of the report, including the establishment of a follow-up commission.  It is essential that the Bahraini authorities address the serious shortcomings identified in the report in a timely, transparent and thorough manner, and I call on all sides to participate in the work of the follow-up commission as part of a process of national reconciliation founded on constructive dialogue. I particularly urge the Bahraini authorities to hold accountable those who, according to the report, were responsible for violations of human rights.  The Ambassador in Riyadh has relayed my concerns regarding the human rights situation to the Bahraini authorities including with regard to the case of Mr. Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and will continue to do so at every opportunity.  Ireland has also been active in ensuring the EU remains focussed on the situation in Bahrain and the EU demarched the Bahraini authorities last month urging the authorities to release political detainees.   Mr. Al-Khawaja is a leading Bahraini human rights activist and a former Frontline coordinator who was arrested in April 2011 for his alleged role in the unrest in Manama last year. On 22 June 2011, after violent abuse in detention which resulted in serious head injuries requiring urgent medical treatment, Mr. Al-Khawaja was sentenced to life imprisonment. As I have stated previously, I do not believe that Mr Al-Khawaja received a trial meeting international standards.  His trial was conducted in circumstances closely resembling a military trial — civilians should be tried in ordinary civilian courts. I continue to regard the life sentence imposed upon him as appalling.I welcome the reforms that have been introduced in Bahrain since the 2011 uprising but I regret that Mr. Al-Khawaja remains in detention. There is an urgent need for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Al-Khawaja's arrest, detention and subsequent trial. I will continue to monitor developments in this case closely.

Both Ambassadors have already taken up duty at their new posts. Mr. Peter McIvor has been Ambassador to Estonia since August 2010.     The Government believes that there is a net benefit to the State in maintaining a resident Embassy in Stockholm. As well as our common engagement on the European Union agenda, Ireland has substantial economic interests in Sweden, which is a valuable source of inward investment and tourism. Ireland's trade surplus with Sweden is calculated at €340 million (exports of €670 million compared with imports of €330 million) and the Swedish economy, one of the best performing in the EU, continues to present significant opportunities for Irish exporters. There are currently no plans to alter the size or nature of Ireland's representation to Sweden, which is modest by any standards. The Embassy comprises an Ambassador at Counsellor level and a Third Secretary, supported by three local administrative staff.

Of these, 70, 911 accounts, were in arrears for more than 90 days and of that figure 53,086 were in arrears for over 180 days.The published figures also show that, during the quarter ended December 2011, legal proceedings were issued to enforce the debt/security on a mortgage in 95 cases. 187 court proceedings were concluded in the quarter, of which the courts granted orders for possession /sale in 109 cases and 133 properties were taken into possession by lenders during the quarter, of which 50 were repossessed on foot of Court Orders  and the balance following voluntary surrender or abandonment.The data also shows that there was a total stock of 74,379 accounts that were categorised as restructured at the end of December 2011. Arrangements whereby at least the interest only portion of the mortgage is being met account for just over half of all restructured type.For more detailed information, the Deputy should consult the relevant press release on the Central Bank's website: www.centralbank.ie.

Holding a One Year Certificate in Agriculture forms only one part of the qualifying conditions and possession of this qualification alone does not or did not meet the statutory requirements for entitlement to the relief as set out in the Sections above.

In order to ensure that proposals in relation to such mortgages are consistent with the Central Bank's consumer protection and prudential policy objectives, the proposed criteria for any such facility would need to be agreed in advance between mortgage lenders and the Central Bank.  In response to that letter, only a small number of mortgage lenders said that they would consider offering such a facility. The Central Bank continues to engage with lenders on these products.Products involving the transfer of the negative equity portion of loans need to be introduced in a careful and controlled manner having regard to the long term interests and indebtedness positions of the consumers involved given the lack of certainty concerning future property prices. In this context, I am informed by the Central Bank that any institution offering such a facility may only do so in accordance with criteria agreed in advance with the Central Bank.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	850	I am informed by NAMA that the scenario outlined by the Deputy is not part of any arrangement that the Agency has approved, or would approve, with a debtor.  A debtor must receive NAMA's approval to the proposed sale price of any asset that has been targeted for disposal. It also requires debtors to conduct sales using a competitive sales process aimed at maximising the price achieved on the sale. The process and the resultant flow of funds is closely monitored by NAMA. The proceeds of such sales are directly applied to reducing the debtor's outstanding indebtedness.I am informed by NAMA that where debtors fully co-operate with NAMA it is considering, in some cases, the introduction of incentivisation arrangements which are intended to achieve the best result for NAMA. I understand from NAMA that these arrangements are still being developed by the agency. However it is possible that where a debtor achieved a key financial milestone, such as the payment of all NAMA's loan acquisition costs plus 10 per cent, it could be possible to put an incentive arrangement in place to enable him to retain a small percentage of every euro achieved above that financial milestone.If a debtor is not incentivised to achieve a return in excess of a minimum target set by NAMA, the agency believes it will get very little over and above that target. The objective of the incentive is to get the debtor working not so much for himself but for the taxpayer and NAMA.

The Central Bank has advised me that, as some persons have more than one credit card, it is not possible to indicate the number of persons who are in arrears with credit card repayments. However, the Central Bank has advised me that the outstanding indebtedness on credit cards at end December 2011 was €2,789 million. This figure is comprised of €2,642 million on personal cards and €147 million on business cards.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	853	All National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). Under section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA. The NTMA also provides NAMA with business and support services and systems. Staff in the NTMA's central corporate functions (e.g. HR, IT and Financial Control) who are not assigned to NAMA provide services to NAMA as well as to other NTMA business units.  The legislation which established the NTMA in 1990 deliberately positioned it outside of the wider public service structures with operational freedom to negotiate market-competitive salaries so that it would have, for example, the flexibility to recruit specialists in mid-career from the private sector. Under the NTMA business model, its remuneration structure is such that there are no general pay grades and no pay scales and all staff are on individually-negotiated contracts. NTMA staff members are subject to the Public Service Pension Deduction.Details of NTMA salaries at end-January 2012, as provided by the Agency, broken down by the salary bands that have previously been used in relation to pay in the NTMA group, are as follows:Salary BandNumber of StaffUp to €100,000306From €100,001 to €150,00096From €150,001 to €200,00029From €200,001 to €250,0004Over €250,00012

The VAT Directive provides that the supply of goods and services by taxable persons is subject to VAT, unless specifically exempted under its terms.  The terms of the Directive do not provide for variations in VAT treatment for specific periods and as such it is not possible to provide for a scheme of the kind proposed.Furthermore, it is not possible to apply a VAT rate of 1% to any good or service as the VAT Directive provides that a minimum reduced rate of 5% apply and only in relation to set goods and services listed in Annex III of the Directive. Personal computers and related products are not listed in Annex III and as such the standard VAT rate of 23% must apply to them.

An individual may also claim tax relief on interest paid on a loan used by him or her in the purchase, repair, development or improvement of the sole or main residence of:(a) his or her widowed parent and/or widowed parent in law; and(b) a relative of his or her where such relative is incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself.There is no provision in tax law to grant tax relief to family members on loan interest paid by them on behalf of another family member.

NAMA informs me that it has recruited its staff largely from the banking, financial and property sectors nationally and internationally and that many of them will have been employed, at some stage in their careers, by one or more of the companies and firms that operate in those sectors. NAMA assures me that it takes all necessary steps to ensure that conflicts of interest do not occur. Under Section 42 of the NAMA Act, before he or she is assigned to NAMA, each officer is required to provide a statement of his or her interests, assets and liabilities. When procuring services, the Agency ensures that potential conflicts of interest are managed effectively and that staff do not participate in decisions which may involve the allocation of work to companies for which they worked previously.The Agency also advises that NAMA staff are precluded from being directors of commercial entities.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	858	I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 80 and 81 together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT is chargeable on the supply of goods and services within the State by a taxable person.  The charge to VAT arises regardless of whether the person who is supplied with the goods or services is VAT-registered, exempt from VAT or a private individual.  The charging of VAT on supplies of goods and services to public sector bodies is in accordance with the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 (as amended) and the EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC with which domestic VAT legislation in all Member States must conform.The Revenue Commissioners are conscious of the compliance burden associated with collecting and accounting for fiduciary taxes and have, in recent years, responded by making it easier to comply through the provision of improved information and the availability of more electronic channels of communication.The supply of a professional medical care service, as supplied by the public health service, is an exempt activity for the purposes of VAT in accordance with both national and EU legislation.  The consequences of the activity being exempt from VAT is that health service providers do not charge VAT on fees charged to patients and health service providers cannot recover VAT charged to them on their inputs.  The European Court of Justice has interpreted medical care services as those services that are carried out for the purposes of protecting, including maintaining or restoring, a patient's health, or diagnosing, treating, and if possible, curing diseases and health disorders.Recruitment agencies do not provide medical care services.  Rather, they provide staff to suppliers of medical care services.  The provision of staff, including doctors, is a service that is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Where a recruitment agency supplies doctors to a public health service, and that doctor remains an employee of the recruitment agency rather than becoming an employee of the health service, then VAT must be charged on the total amount that the recruitment agency is entitled to receive from the health service for the supply of the doctor.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The last number of years have been very difficult for the Irish people. The economy contracted in real terms by 10 per cent between 2007 and 2010 and this has been accompanied by severe fiscal and banking crises. Reflecting the substantial improvements in competitiveness which have taken place in recent years the economy returned to growth during 2011. We are also seeing a resumption of inward Foreign Direct Investment which points to the fact that many of the underlying strengths of our economy remain, including a well-educated workforce, favourable demographics, an open and flexible economy and a pro-enterprise environment.Of course there are many challenges which we still face and it will take time to work through the legacies of the crisis. Not least of these is the high level of Government debt which we have accumulated as a result of the substantial fiscal deficits that were recorded in each of the last four years and the very significant costs of providing support to the banking sector. Substantial corrective action has been taken to return stability to the public finances and while the General Government Debt is now forecast to peak at 119 per cent of GDP next year, it is expected to decline to 115 per cent by 2015 based on current projections. We are also on track to bring the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015, in line with the targets set out under our EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.In relation to targets for bank-lending, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20 billion over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	861	I am informed by NAMA that as part of the process of acquiring land, development and associated loans from the participating institutions it carried out a rigorous due diligence exercise. This included a legal review of title to the property; an evaluation of the value of the property underpinning the loan and other features of the loan agreement such as the level of income that the loan generated.  NAMA assures me therefore that there has been a  thorough examination of all the property assets it has acquired and this helps inform its strategy towards the disposal of these assets.       NAMA's core commercial objective is to recover for the taxpayer whatever it has paid for the acquired assets in addition to whatever it has invested to enhance property assets underpinning these loans. NAMA will develop strategies to achieve its objectives in the context of the broader purposes of the NAMA Act 2009 taking account of the need to contribute to the social and economic development of the State.A significant element of the assets acquired by NAMA are outside the State and their disposal will not impact on property prices within the State.  As regards the domestic property market, NAMA is in the process of developing a range of strategies for the different types of property which underpin its loans. For example, it is developing a stapled finance product and considering the possibility of Qualified Investment Funds for its commercial property assets and considering other mechanisms to deal with domestic property assets. It is also working to attract international capital into the domestic property market. The Chairman of NAMA has indicated that the loan portfolio will be managed in a structured way by the Agency.By adopting a multi pronged strategy to deal with the wide variety of assets and given the current weakness of the domestic property market, the likelihood of NAMA contributing to a significant escalation in property prices is minimised. With the steep and ongoing decline in both commercial and residential property prices since 2007, the more immediate challenge facing these markets is to achieve some degree of price stability and an increase in transactional activity and liquidity. NAMA considers that one of its roles over the coming years is to contribute to a renewal of sustainable activity in the Irish market.

This is set out in the following table:Year% of NAMA debt paid down201325%201540%201780%201895%2019100%NAMA ran a number of scenarios which projected the Net Present Value outcome of its activities over its expected lifespan.

This Code applies to all financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank (regulated entities). If a regulated entity is selling a financial product, including a mortgage, to a person who is a "personal consumer" for the purposes of the Code, then the regulated entity may only sell a mortgage product  that is suitable for the consumer based on the information that has been supplied by the consumer.Provision 5.9 of the Code requires that prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer, a lender must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the  consumer's likely ability to repay the debt, over the duration of the agreement. In the case of all mortgage products provided to personal consumers, the results of a test on the personal consumer's ability to repay the instalments, over the duration of the mortgage agreement, on the basis of a 2% interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer must be ascertained. This test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more.In addition, provision 5.13 requires that a regulated entity must take account of the affordability assessment when deciding whether a personal consumer is likely to be able to repay the debt for that amount and duration in the manner required under the credit agreement.  I expect that the conditions set out in the Code will continue in operation for the provision of mortgages over the coming period.  A copy of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code is available on the Central Bank's website www.CentralBank.ie

These cover 95 per cent of the total acquisition value of NAMA debt. In a majority of cases, NAMA expect that its ongoing discussions with debtors will lead to agreements with debtors on asset disposals and debt repayments and, where applicable, on the reversal of asset transfers to relatives and a securing of charges over unencumbered assets. In a minority of cases where a debtor's business is unviable or where there is a lack of co-operation, it will be necessary for NAMA to enforce against the debtor. Information on the proportion of debtors falling into the respective categories will be available when the debtor business plan review process has been completed.

The Central Bank's primary regulatory role concerns regulated financial service providers.  The Central Bank has informed me that it does not regulate individual insurance or investment products as this is a commercial matter for the companies concerned. The Central Bank has in place a consumer protection code which applies to all financial service providers including insurance companies, regulated by them (regulated entities). This code sets out rules that regulated entities must comply with when dealing with their customers.I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) are jointly approved by the Pensions Board and the Revenue Commissioners. Revenue also approves Occupational Pension Schemes and certain other Pension Products.

The ECB is also providing significant liquidity support to the Irish banking system. There is widespread recognition amongst our fellow EU Member States that we are in a difficult situation but there is widespread recognition too of the fact that we are dealing with these difficulties and are making progress.  We are very grateful for the support we have received. It affords us the necessary breathing space, and access to secure funding at favourable interest rates we need in order to restore sustainability to our public finances, repair our banking system and return to sustainable economic growth.Notwithstanding this support, we are anxious to regain our economic and financial sovereignty, to return to the international financial markets to source our funding and to end our reliance on Programme funding. That is the ultimate aim of the EU/IMF Programme and I am sure that it is what those who are providing us with financial support at this time want to see also.

This is an important provision as it encompasses greater ownership in ensuring the appropriate conduct of fiscal policies at national level.  This is how compliance will be ensured.  In terms of the deficit target, the structural deficit of each Member State will need to be at its country-specific medium term objective (MTO), and member states are required to ensure rapid convergence towards their MTOs.  These requirements are in line with the revisions to the Stability and Growth Pact, contained in the so-called "six-pack" of legislative reforms.  The timeframe for convergence towards the MTO will be proposed by the Commission taking into account country-specific sustainability risks.  Member States can only temporarily deviate from their MTOs only in exceptional circumstances.

The Deputy will note that there has been no decrease in the net issuance of currency over the period shown.  The tables show Irish banknote and coin circulation for end-1990, 1995 and 2000 and euro banknote and coin net issuance for 2003 to 2011.  As the euro circulates freely throughout the euro system, it is not possible to give a euro circulation figure for any one eurozone country.  Net issuance is the difference between the cumulative total value of banknotes and coin issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the cumulative total value of banknotes and coin returned to the Central Bank of Ireland since the introduction of the euro.  The European Central Bank is responsible for the strategic planning and co-ordination of the production and issuance of euro banknotes.  Euro banknotes are put into circulation by eurozone National Central Banks according to demand.

The Schedule to the Special Management Order in relation to Newbridge Credit Union Ltd. gives an indication of the positions which may be held by the team of Special Manager Assistants working with the Special Manager as follows: Partner, Director, Senior Manager, Manager and Senior. The number of people working with the Special Manager from the company to which you refer will vary according to the work being undertaken by the Special Manager.  The Deputy might note that the total fees to be paid to the Special Manager and his team will be subject to approval by the Court upon request by the Special Manager. This request has not been made at this point. The request would typically include sufficient information for the Court to determine if the fees are reasonable, and might include a work schedule, indicating tasks performed, hours worked, and staff levels.The Special Management Order provides for an appointment of 6 months duration.

Schools receive capitation funding in January and June, and the ancillary services grant in March.The amount paid to an individual national school by way of capitation and ancillary services grants is determined by the school's enrolment, subject to a minimum grant in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60 and a maximum grant in the case of schools of 500 or more.The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools. The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.In due course, both grant schemes will be merged. In the interim, both grants will continue to be paid according to existing timelines and calculated separately as heretofore.

A number of potential sites that were identified have been deemed unsuitable for a number of reasons. However, my Department will continue to engage with the relevant stakeholders in relation to identifying a suitable site.  The acquisition of a site will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.As the Deputy is aware, the Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years. In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. I have previously committed to publishing shortly a five year plan outlining the school building projects that will commence construction in that time.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	877	Prior to 1st January 2001, drugs projects were funded through Local Drugs Task Forces by the then Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Since 2001, responsibility for 36 of these projects was transferred to my Department, a process referred to as "mainstreaming".  My Department issued annual allocations to the VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County and Dun Laoghaire to administer the projects.The tables provide a list of the 36 mainstream drug projects and their annual funding as requested by the Deputy. It has not been possible to provide data, for the years 2001-03, for a small number of the projects. My Department will forward the data to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available. Funding for these projects rose significantly between 2001 and 2009.In the context of difficult ‘Estimates' circumstances, the global allocation available for these projects in 2010 was reduced by 32%, as compared to the allocation for 2009.  In the Dublin City area, a decision was taken by the VEC to prioritise those projects where frontline staff were employed. In that context, no further allocations were made by the VEC to six projects.During 2010, my Department carried out a review of the remaining 30 projects. A number of the projects overlapped significantly with projects in the Youth Work area funded by the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and also with the School Completion Programme funded by this Department's Social Inclusion Unit. The review, therefore, focused on whether the projects could more appropriately and more efficiently be funded through these funding streams. Following the review:—(a) 21 projects, by agreement and with appropriate funding, transferred to the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, from January 2011,(b) Two projects ceased operation in 2010,(c) Two projects, with funding, merged with the School Completion Programme which, during 2011, became the responsibility of the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs,(d) The remaining five projects continue to receive allocations from my Department.Project2001 €2002 €2003 €2004 €2005 €2006 €2007 €2008 €2009 €2010 €2011 €2012 €Aishling Project**160,000210,065200,137256,035299,342317,438330.136330,136329,389274,013Ballybough Youth Services*43,00056,45553,78653,78657,11468,09670,82070,82070,65958,781Ballyfermot Youth Federation*46,00060,39457,53984,53986,108116,738121,408121,408121,133100,769Ballymun Incentives for Youth Group84,000110,284105,072105,072109,274110,000114,400114,400114,141NilNilNilBallymun LDTF (Minibus)15,00019,69418,76319,26319,26320,00020,80020,80020,753NilNilNilBallymun Prev Prog. in Youth Groups10,00013,12912,51014,51014,51015,00015,60015,60015,565NilNilNilBallymun Youth Support Workers*60,00078,77575,05095,050110,000125,964131,003131,003130,707108,732Bonnybrook Youth Project*133,000174,617166,363166,363166,363175,036182,038182,038181,626151,092Canal Comm.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Education Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 being upheld.The parents/guardians of the pupil in question may wish to contact my Department at the Section 29 Appeals Administration Unit, Friar's Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, (phone 044 9337008) if they wish to take an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area. The contact details for the NEWB in your area is National Educational Welfare Board, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7, phone number 01-8738700.

Applications for patronage of the new second level schools to be established in 2013 and 2014 have been sought by my Department from prospective patrons, including Educate Together, and the closing date for receipt of applications is 24th February 2012. My Department asked prospective patrons to register expressions of interest by Friday, 13th January 2012 of the areas where they intended making formal applications for patronage of the new schools. Details of these expressions of interest and the procedures and criteria for determining patronage of the new schools are available on the Department's website.

This reflects an historical legacy.  Over recent decades, Irish society has undergone major political, social, cultural, demographic and educational change. At the same time a greater diversity of religious beliefs and non-belief systems within the population has emerged.One of the key priorities in the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 programme was the initiation of "a time-limited Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector to allow all stakeholders including parents to engage in open debate on change of patronage in communities where it is appropriate and necessary".The Forum was launched in April 2011 and the work was overseen by an Advisory Group. Its terms of reference were, in summary, to advise the Minister on: 1.  how the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none; 2.  the practicalities of divesting of patronage  3.  how such transfer/divesting can be advanced.  The Forum was to have regard for the expressed willingness of the Roman Catholic Church to consider divesting patronage of primary schools and the current financial constraints.  The Advisory Group has concentrated on the above terms and also on how diversity within a stand alone school, in particular, could be achieved. I expect to be in a position to publish the Forum Report shortly.  In June last year, I announced that 40 new schools would be established in the next six years and at the same time I set out the criteria for deciding on patronage of the new schools. Such criteria are to place a particular emphasis on parental demand forplurality and diversity of patronage.In summary, the overall intention is to provide parents, where possible, with a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none and where it is only feasible to have a single school to ensure that it is inclusive and caters for the needs of all its pupils.

The overall approach to ICT, based on the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is that ICT is not a subject, but rather a tool to be integrated into all aspects of teaching and learning. The Council has published a curriculum framework for ICT setting out the range of skills and learning outcomes which students should achieve. This work is supported by professional development for teachers, by digital content on the scoilnet website, and by investment in ICT infrastructure in schools.My colleague, the  Minster for Communication Energy and Natural Resources and I have committed to connecting all post primary schools to 100Mbps broadband service by the end of 2014. Reliable high speed broadband connections will allow for improved integration of ICT in learning through providing teachers and students with confidence in accessing and using media-rich educational resources hosted online.Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games is a module on the NCCA website which has been developed for Transition Year by LERO, the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre. LERO brings together leading software engineering teams from universities and institutes of technology in a centre of excellence with a strong industry focus. Students learn to write their own programmes, animations and stories and develop computer programming and games skills using Scratch software. The lesson plans and materials needed to teach the module are available from LERO. Whether the module is offered is a matter for decision locally by schools.To date the programme is being implemented in 50 schools and 150 have registered their interest in providing it in the future. Professional development for teachers is being provided by LERO with the support of the National Centre for Technology in Education.The forthcoming reforms in junior cycle will allow for the introduction of school developed short courses of 100 hours duration as an option, building on examples developed by the NCCA. This will provide further opportunities for schools to progress the use of programmes such as Cojer Dodo if they wish to do so.

A number of other EU member states are understood from European Commission reports not to have implemented any new measures, or simply to have intensified existing measures, in the implementation of EGF programmes.However, my Department has been very flexible in its interpretation of the term "complementarity" in its implementation of EGF programmes in Ireland to date.In all EGF programmes to date, specific tailored interventions have been designed and provided in addition to more mainstream, established interventions. For example, a system of EGF training grants has been operated whereby EGF eligible persons may avail of privately provided training and education opportunities subject to relevant scheme requirements in addition to, or in lieu of, training and education provided through publicly funded training bodies and educational institutions. The provision of extra places in FÁS or VEC training or upskilling programmes is complementary to existing provision, as is the provision of places on other training and education programmes that are relevant to labour market needs and which are recognised through accreditation or other recognition by relevant industry sectors.

This new  brand has been rolled out in a number of key markets, including the USA, China  and Russia.The development of agreed priority markets by the High Level Group on  International Education and the development of market-specific plans.The roll-out of market-specific initiatives, such as a trusted agents  programme in India, which will rolled-out in other markets.Ministerial level visits to strategic markets including the USA, Malaysia and  Singapore and official level visits to India and Russia.The coming period will see a targeted focus on our priority markets. This will  include Ministerial-led education missions to China and India and other visits  to key partners in the Gulf and Latin America.  Inward visits will also be  hosted from major partners in South East Asia and the Gulf.I will also be launching an international scholarship scheme to target  high-performing students in our key markets, with a view to significantly  raising Ireland's profile.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department's website. However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.  Surplus teachers in schools will be redeployed to vacancies in other neighbouring schools in accordance with the redeployment arrangements.  My Department will be notifying schools shortly of the new staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year. It will include details of the staffing appeals process and appeal criterion for those small schools that are projecting increased enrolments that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.

In addition a National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy is being progressed which is designed to promote curriculum reform in both Irish and English, to strengthen assessment, improve professional development of teachers, extend the duration of initial teacher education and help parents to support their children's learning.A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012.  The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.In addition, I have endorsed the NCCA's proposals for junior cycle reform which will begin in 2014 for first examination in 2017.  As part of the overall approach and the phasing in of reforms, the Irish syllabus will be reviewed, and there will be a strengthening of portfolio and other forms of assessment.  It is noted that the ESRI longitudinal study tracking some 700 students as they moved through the second level system reported that Irish was the least liked subject, perceived as least interesting and least useful by students.  However,  in the Leaving Certificate in 2011,  32.3% of students sat Irish at higher level (of whom 83.9% scored at Grade ABC). 56.8% sat Irish at ordinary level, of whom 76% scored at Grade ABC, and 10.9% sat the subject at Foundation Level.The results of the 2006 census indicates that 1.66m people reported the ability to speak Irish, that this was most prevalent among students in the school age population, but that it declined significantly in the over 20 age groups.  Only 9.1% of the population reported that they speak Irish daily or weekly outside of the education system.  Initiatives such as Abair Leat,  under which students can improve their Irish by interacting over the internet with native Irish speakers, have  been promoted in post primary schools by comedian Des Bishop in moves designed to promote the popularity of Irish.  Students can use the website to listen to native Irish speakers, record their own material in Irish and undertake self-correcting exercises.

There are existing wholly State-funded intervention programmes for young children at risk of educational disadvantage.  The Early Start programme aims to provide an educational programme for children aged 3-4 which would enhance their overall development and offset the effects of social disadvantage.  The specific objectives of the programme are:  To enhance the children's language cognitive and social/emotional development by engaging them in structured play activities which are characterised by high quality adult/child interaction. To assess the strengths and needs of each child in relation to language, cognition and social/emotional development and to plan and deliver a programme of learning to meet the identified needs in these key areas of learning. To devise strategies which actively engage parents in the education of their children.The Early Start programme has been in existence since the mid 1990s and this programme along with the Rutland Street pre-school programme were, until recently, the only wholly State funded educational programmes for pre-school children.  In recent years, the State along with Atlantic Philanthropies have funded Prevention and Early Intervention Programmes in areas of disadvantage.  These include YoungBallymun, Tallaght's Childhood Development Initiative and the Preparing for Life Programme in Darndale.  The evidence accruing from these intervention programmes as to what works most effectively for young children at risk of educational disadvantage will inform any further targeted interventions.

The discussions held may be in the context of scheduled reviews and evaluations as required under the EGF Regulation or on a case-by-case basis in relation to specific Irish EGF applications.In terms of assessing potential future EGF applications, the Department monitors statutory collective redundancy notifications, maintains contact with relevant Government Departments with responsibility for particular sectoral interests and monitors news and media sources, forecasts and other relevant sources of information, including through the political system.  The primary aim of this monitoring is to assess whether sufficient grounds exist to make a sustainable EGF application in respect of redundant workers in a particular company or on a sectoral basis.Where the initial view is taken that a potential EGF application may be made, the Department commences detailed preparatory work to ensure that all relevant EGF regulatory criteria are met.  As part of this process various levels of interaction with key stakeholders and service providers are required.  As a result of this process, the next EGF application which is to be made by the Department will be in support of almost 600 redundant workers at the Talk Talk company in Waterford and a number of ancillary enterprises.

No licenses have been issued in the past four years in respect of dual use controlled technology intended for export to Syria.From preliminary contact with the exporters concerned I understand the exported software is designed to protect mobile users from spam, viruses etc., and is not intended to prevent citizens exercising their fundamental democratic rights of free speech and assembly.  My understanding is that the software was provided to telecom providers and not to any Government organisation or agency.  However, my investigation into the matter has just commenced and I will be pursuing it further with the companies concerned to establish whether any restricted or sanctioned technology is involved.More generally, I would like to point out that prior to issuing any export license for goods intended for a country where there is civil or military strife, I consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This is an essential part of considering any application for an export licence and it involves a detailed a consideration of any human rights implications connected with a possible export.At EU level, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed on 1 December and 23 January additional measures which I entirely support related to the energy, financial, banking and trade sectors, as well as the listing of additional individuals and entities involved in the violence or supporting the regime.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14322	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	900	An issue arose following a High Court judgement in October 2010 where it was held that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Coyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunctiont against an intermediary in relation to transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Article 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  Non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter and could leave Ireland exposed to damages arising from legal actions based on non-compliance as well as proceedings by the European Commission.A public consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed statutory instrument amending section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  More than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation.  It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  I have also engaged extensively with stakeholders with a wide range of views in relation to any issues or concerns that have been raised in relation to the matter.Under the proposed legislative measure, an order may be sought by copyright holders only in relation to their own works.  Any order against an intermediary will be subject to a judicial process.  This must involve due consideration of the rights of other persons likely to be affected, such as internet service providers and consumers.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same status as a treaty when implementing EU law, must be considered.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  These rights include the right to intellectual property, the important and fundamental human right of protection of private data, the equally important human right of freedom of expression and information and also the right to conduct a business.The amended text of the proposed statutory instrument was recently published by my Department and it should also be noted that this matter was the subject of a Dáil debate on 31 January 2012.

Accordingly, if an employment permit holder wishes to change employer then a new application will have to be made on their behalf.  There are no restrictions on foreign nationals who are the holders of current valid employment permits changing employer and the need for a Labour Market Test would not apply in such cases.  However, in the event that a foreign national ceases to be employed by the employer named on the permit then the permit is no longer valid and must be returned to my Department for cancellation.The Employment Permits Section has no record of current valid employment permits in respect of the named individuals and, in these circumstances, the current policy in relation to new first time applications would apply.It is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:highly skilled, highly paid positions or;non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;positions requiring specialist or scarce skills, expertise or qualifications which cannot be filled elsewise.In line with this policy, applications for new work permits are subject to a strict labour market needs test intended to maximise opportunities for filling of vacancies from within the Irish labour market and wider EEA.

Exchequer funding for the BICs is provided by my Department, channelled through and managed by Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland and the BICs have formed a very good working partnership as they provide a complementary approach to achieving a common objective of balanced regional industrial development, the promotion of entrepreneurship and innovation and support for potential knowledge based start-up enterprises.  A senior official within the Enterprise Development Unit of my Department acts as a liaison and contact point for the Irish BICs.

In considering candidates for appointment, my priority and overriding focus is to find the best people for particular board appointments.  In doing so I have regard to several factors including the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board. Candidates are not required to indicate if they are retired.  Therefore, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	910	The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU regulations which co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.For the purposes of the EU regulations, Irish Child Benefit is classified as a family benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits. EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under the EU regulations. As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is bound to apply these regulations in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty regarding free movement of persons.Before payment is made in respect of children resident in other EU countries it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will impact on any entitlement under the Irish system. Once payment has commenced, as part of the Department's ongoing control programme, these customers are required to confirm periodically their continued entitlement to benefit.  Where questions arise in relation to entitlement, or there is a delay in responding to enquiries from the Department, payment is suspended pending investigation.I have raised the issue of payment of Child Benefit in respect of non-resident children at EU level, both formally, with EU Commissioner Andor on his visit to Dublin last year, and informally, with relevant Ministers from other EU countries, and will continue to do so. The Commissioner stressed the importance the European Commission attaches to the system of coordinating social security for the role it plays in encouraging and facilitating free movement of people across the Union. He indicated that he would be extremely reluctant to introduce changes along the lines that have been suggested because they would discriminate against migrant workers and would not be in line with judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	911	I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 157, 160 to 162, inclusive, 164, 165 and 167 together.The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  Social welfare fraud is not a victimless crime. However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.My Department has a comprehensive programme of reviews of customers claims across all social welfare schemes. These reviews include a full review of the customer's means and circumstances to ensure that all eligibility criteria are fulfilled. Where the means or circumstances have changed to a level that impinges on the rate in payment, then the claim will be examined by a deciding officer.Where, following a review of a claim in payment, it is confirmed that the customer had been receiving a payment to which he/she was not entitled, or were receiving a payment at a higher rate than entitled to, a deciding officer makes a revised decision on the entitlement. Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or evidence and the circumstances of the case. This can result in the assessment of an overpayment.Where the deciding officer is of the view that the customer inadvertently failed to notify the Department of the relevant change in means or circumstances, the case is recorded as customer error. Departmental error overpayments are recorded where the error was due to clerical, systems or administrative error.The deciding officer may decide that a case is one of suspected fraud where it appears to him/her that the customer knowingly gave false or misleading information or wilfully concealed relevant information. The Department does not categorise a case as fraudulent unless the fraud is proven in court.Criminal prosecutions are taken against persons who defraud the social welfare payments system and employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations.  The Department ensures that cases which merit prosecution are forwarded for consideration of legal proceedings and must ensure that all necessary evidential proofs are available. During 2010, the Department sent a total of 209 alleged fraud cases to the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO) for criminal prosecution.  In addition to the 209 cases sent directly by the Department to the CSSO a further 132 cases were referred to the Gardai for consideration of criminal proceedings to be taken under the Criminal Justice (Fraud and Theft) Act, 2001. In total, the Department referred 341 cases for legal proceedings by way of either the social welfare or criminal justice legislation. In 2010, a total of 253 criminal cases were finalised in court. The following table is a breakdown of the classification of overpayments from 2006 to 2010:

Control savings represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure on fraudulent claims over a future period.  These control savings refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work the social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount. Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error.  Control savings do not include any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  All of these control savings arise from proactive reviews on claims in payment.  They are not broken down between fraud or suspected fraud and error.  As outlined above, the  overpayments assessed are categorised as suspected fraud, customer and departmental error.The following table shows the control savings achieved in the past 5 years per scheme.20072008200920102011Control SavingsControl SavingsControl SavingsControl SavingsControl SavingsSchemeAchievedAchievedAchievedAchievedAchieved€m€m€m€m€mJobseekers139101605782Illness7073909592Pensions538584110142One-parent family payment13513811771167Child Benefit18488910888Carers57131711Family Income Supplement121017912Other/SWA Employer inspections/ PRSI1514131651Total€447m€476m€483m€483m€645m

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	913	There are two categories of contributory State pension:- State pension (transition) (SPT) payable at age 65 and State pension (contributory) (SPC) payable at age 66.   The qualifying conditions for State pension (transition) require the applicant to:have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 55 years.have at least 260 full-rate social insurance contributions paid since the date of entry into insurance.Have a minimum yearly average of 24 contributions (paid or credited) since the date of entry into insurance.have retired from work.State pension (transition) ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to (SPC).   The qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) require the applicant tohave entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years.have at least 260 weeks full-rate contributions paid, from employment or self-employment, since entry into insurance.Have a minimum yearly average of 10 contributions (paid or credited) since the date of entry into insurance.As provided for in legislation since 1997, the minimum paid contribution requirement for SPT and SPC will increase to 520 contributions in April 2012.  In relation to date of entry, the legislation provides that the date of entry into insurance is the date a person becomes an insured person and enters employment for which a social insurance contribution is payable.  This contribution can be paid at the full, modified or self employed social insurance rate. It is not possible to waive legislative requirements when determining the nature and rate of pension payable.  There is no provision for disregarding any early paid contributions for the purposes of increasing the rate of State Contributory pension even where contributions are of an intermittent or occasional nature.  For the purposes of the averaging system in place, a date of entry into insurance is an essential element of the assessment system and is provided for in legislation.Different eligibility criteria apply under the self employment legislation which provides that where an individual who is self employed has paid standard PRSI prior to 6th April 1988, and where s/he entered self-employed PRSI on 6th April 1988, either the initial date of entry or the later 1988 date can be used  as the commencement date of the assessment for State Pension Contributory, whichever is the more favourable.  However, where the date is later than 6th April 1988 the earlier date is the date which is used for assessment.  Similarly, different eligibility criteria applies where the alternative contribution test is applied (ACT) to the assessment process, where a person has a minimum yearly average of 47.5 contributions from 6th April 1979 to the year that they reach 65 or 66 years of age.I do not consider this to be an anomaly as this legislation provision has been in place since pensions were first introduced.  As part of the pensions reform programme, the introduction of a ‘total contributions' approach will replace the current averaging system from 2020.  This means that from 2020 a person will require 30 years' contributions and credits to qualify for maximum pension with 10 years' paid contributions required for a minimum pension.  The amount of credits which can be used to claim pension will be capped at 10 years.  This system will be fairer as the level of pension payment will be proportionate to a person's working career e.g. a person with 25 years contributions will receive 25/30ths of a pension.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	914	It is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information requested as information on clients in receipt of State Pension (contributory) is not held in a manner which facilitates an answer to the question asked.To qualify for a state pension contributory at age 66, the person concerned must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions.  These conditions are outlined as follows:1. Have entered into insurable employment before age 56.2. Have at least 260 weeks full rate contributions paid (520 contributions after 6 April 2012).
3. Have a yearly average of at least 10 contributions recorded (taking paid and credited PRSI conditions into account) from 1953 or from the date of entry into insurance (whichever is the later) to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  To qualify for the maximum rate a yearly average of 48 contributions is required.Self-employed social insurance contributions (Class S) are counted as full rate contributions for State pension (contributory).  If you were self-employed and started paying PRSI Class S contributions on 6th April 1988, your entitlement to State pension (contributory) may be calculated based on your social insurance record from that date provided you satisfy the other conditions for that pension.

Under the programme, employers apply to offer ‘work placements', for a maximum duration of nine months, within their organisations, and those who are unemployed can apply for these placements.  The eligibility criteria for this programme are advertised on www.fas.ie and are available to people in the form of literature in local employment services and DSP offices.  Any changes to eligibility criteria are in the fist instance communicated to relevant staff and the internal information sources that they reference are updated accordingly.  The WPP participant eligibility criteria have remained unchanged since 2010.  The WPP eligibility criteria for an unemployed person are:The Programme is open to all people who are unemployed, including people who are not in receipt of any social welfare payment.  For those not in receipt of a payment, they may undertake a placement with no payment.For those in receipt of a social welfare payment, they may take up the placement, under certain conditions.  People who are unemployed and are currently in receipt of any of the following payment may apply:Job Seeker's Allowance.Job Seeker's Benefit.Disability Allowance.Blind Pension.Invalidity Pension.Illness Benefit.Lone parents allowance.Deserted Wives Benefit.Widow/Widower's Pension.Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).However to be eligible to retain their payment while on a placement, they must have been unemployed and in receipt of some form of social welfare payment for at least three months.The JobBridge National Internship scheme was announced in July 2011 and the eligibility criteria for access to this programme are different to those for WPP.  The JobBridge eligibility criteria for an unemployed person are:To be eligible for a place as an intern you must be on Live Register and currently in receipt of:Jobseekers Benefit.Jobseekers Allowance.Or signing for Social Insurance Contribution Credits for 3 months (78 days) or more in the last 6 months.Periods spent on Back to Education Allowance, VTOS, FÁS/Fáilte Ireland Training course, Youthreach, FIT, Community Employment Schemes, TUS, the Rural Social Scheme, Back to Work Scheme, Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, FÁS Job Initiative or Job Assist will count towards meeting the eligibility of JobBridge provided:The individual has completed these programmes.Has signed back on to the Live Register.Is in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance or Jobseeker credits immediately before commencing on JobBridge.Individuals in receipt of One Parent Family Payment or Widows Pension are ineligible to participate in JobBridge even if they are also receiving half rate Jobseekers Benefit.Staff are currently operating both schemes and are aware of the different eligibility criteria for each.  Once a person, for example a person who was previously self-employed, can satisfy the eligibility criteria for either scheme, he/she will be informed of such, and be approved to participate.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	917	I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the partial capacity benefit scheme was formally launched on Monday 13th February 2012.  Full details of the scheme have been published on my Department's website and an information leaflet has also been published.The introduction of the partial capacity benefit scheme marks an important and positive development of the social welfare system.  The scheme recognises that the welfare system, which categorised people as ‘fit to work' or ‘unfit to work', did not reflect the reality for many existing welfare customers.  It provides an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive an income support payment.  I believe that the scheme will facilitate greater levels of recruitment of people with disabilities into open market employment.In this regard, I should mention also that there are a range of employment services which had been provided previously by FAS and which are now delivered through my Department which have recently been brought together under a new national identity- “EmployAbility Service”.  The service offers a range of supports, including workplace adaptation grants, wage subsidies and on-site job coaches and mentors, to people with disability and to employers, and is key in supporting people with disabilities overcome the challenges not only of adapting to employment and being accepted in the workplace but in demonstrating their productive capability and ability to do the job.  The service also acts to reassure employers and give them the confidence to take what many perceive to be the risk of employing a person with a disability.The partial capacity benefit scheme is open to people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months.  Participation in the scheme is voluntary and the scheme is designed in particular to respond to the needs of people who have sought to avail of ‘exemptions' in order to take up employment opportunities.  There is no means-test attached to the scheme and, accordingly, the question of an income disregard does not arise.  There is no limit to the number of hours a person in receipt of partial capacity benefit may work and there are no earning limits.

The objectives of the code of practice were to:Provide a comprehensive framework on how Government departments and agencies can engage with people experiencing poverty and social exclusion;Set out the rationale and benefits of engagement for Government departments and agencies;Give guidance on different methods of community engagement and examples of different approaches that have been taken in Ireland;Establish what people can expect from engagement and consultation exercises; andApply tried and tested tools, methods and examples of what works (local, national and international) to an Irish context.A draft version of the code of practice report has been submitted to my Department and is currently under consideration. The intention would be to complete this consideration in the near future and to make it publicly available as soon as possible thereafter.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	920	In assessing weekly family income for the purposes of the family income supplement (FIS) most weekly social welfare payments are taken into account when means are assessed.  This budget measure relating to the inclusion of carer's benefit or carer's allowance payments in the income assessment for FIS is designed to bring the treatment of carer's allowance and carer's benefit into line with how other primary social welfare payments are assessed.  The measure also provides for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of FIS with other social welfare payments.  Furthermore, the measure reduces a person's secondary payment (FIS) without affecting their primary payment, therefore targeting available scarce resources at those in most need.From January 2012, for new applicants and upon renewal for existing claimants, income from carer's allowance and carer's benefit payments will be included in the (FIS) income assessment.  The measure will be implemented on a phased basis over 3 years with 1/3 of the income from carer's allowance and carer's benefit payments assessed in 2012, 2/3 in 2013 and full assessment in 2014.Currently there are approximately 63 carer's payment recipients in County Donegal who may be affected by this change.Carers play a particularly important role in society which the Government acknowledges through a range of supports, including carer's allowance, half-rate carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant, free travel and household benefits.  The Government also recognises that welfare expenditure plays a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable people in Irish society, as well as stabilizing the economy generally.  Although it has not been possible to exempt income support to families from the general budgetary strategy — given the level of adjustments required — the Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair and balanced.

These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 21 October 2011 and the appeal was assigned to an Appeals Officer for consideration on 29 December 2011.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

They provide the Department with an indicator of the estimated risk of non-compliance with scheme rules within the specific schemes surveyed and enable it to enhance procedures and processes to build control across the relevant schemes. The Department establishes the risk and exposure of fraud and error within its schemes by conducting fraud and error surveys at regular intervals.The Department has been in communication with the C&AG over the past number of years regarding these surveys.  Last year, the Department agreed specific criteria with the C&AG for the successful implementation of baseline fraud and error surveys to ensure that they are representative across all scheme criteria.  The survey process involves social welfare inspectors reviewing a random sample of claims (usually in the region of 1,000) to assess the underlying levels of fraud and error.  The inspectors interview the customers in each case and carry out a comprehensive review of their current circumstances and means where relevant.The files are then referred to Deciding Officers in the relevant scheme area who decide whether the rate in payment is correct or whether it should be increased, reduced or terminated, depending on the full facts and circumstances.A Deciding Officer may decide that a case is one of suspected fraud where it appears to him/her that the customer knowingly gave false or misleading information or wilfully concealed relevant information.  In other cases, the Officer may be of the view that the customer inadvertently failed to notify the Department of the relevant change in means or circumstances.  Such cases are recorded as customer error.  Departmental error overpayments are recorded where the error was due to clerical, systems or administrative error.The outcome of those surveys is examined by the Department and appropriate action is then taken by scheme managers to address the fraud and error risks identified.  Furthermore, the review policies and risk management procedures of the schemes are then revised to take account of the risks identified.The following table shows the results of the fraud and errors surveys undertaken over the past number of years on the various schemes, along with the estimated fraud as a percentage of social welfare expenditure on these schemes.SchemeSurvey DateEstimated Fraud as % of Expenditure on Scheme (based on F&E surveys)Child BenefitNov 041.76Family Income SupplementAug 050.8Disability AllowanceNov 052.3Illness BenefitSep 060.1State Pension (non-contributory)May 070One Parent Family PaymentSep 076.4State Pension (contributory)Apr 080.1Jobseekers AllowanceOct 092.1Surveys have been carried out on disability allowance, one-parent family payment and jobseekers benefit over the past two years and I expect that the results of those surveys will be available shortly.In September 2011, I published my Department's Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which included a commitment to carrying out two fraud and error surveys per year.  The proposed medium term programme of surveys to be undertaken over the next five years — as set out in the plan — is set out as follows.  To allow for required flexibility, the position will be reviewed annually. It is also worth noting that additional or varied surveys may be required given specific business needs and emerging trends.YearMonthScheme2011MayOne-Parent Family PaymentSeptJobseeker’s Benefit2012AprilChild BenefitSepJobseeker’s Allowance2013AprInvalidity PensionAprIllness Benefit*SepWidows/widower’s and surviving civil partners contributory pension2014AprFamily Income SupplementAprFree Schemes2014SepCarer’s Allowance2015AprState Pen Non-ConSepState Pen Con2016AprDisability AllowanceSepOne-Parent Family Payment

Decisions relating to the provision of broadband services in any particular area are commercial decisions for the commercial service providers.  Neither I nor ComReg has statutory power to compel any service provider to offer higher levels of broadband service at any particular location.Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the commercial sector to provide high-speed Next Generation Broadband access to every home and business in the State.The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I convened last summer, has an important role to play in this regard.  The Taskforce, which I chair, also comprises Minister of State, Fergus O'Dowd, T.D., the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as targets, spectrum policy, private sector investment plans, and the removal of barriers in order to facilitate investment.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  I intend to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.

For example, building on research commissioned by InterTrade Ireland and carried out by the International Centre for Local and Regional Development (ICLRD), a Framework for Collaboration on Spatial Strategies on the Island of Ireland, which is currently being finalised, outlines the scope for strategic integration and interaction of the National Spatial Strategy and the Northern Ireland Regional Development Strategy to provide a shared spatial planning context on an all-island basis.  A number of sub-regional cross-border initiatives are also being progressed.  For example:The Newry-Dundalk Twin City initiative is progressing a range of economic development, tourism promotion, infrastructure co-ordination and planning measures aimed at enhancing the capability of these important urban centres to drive development in the east border area; andThe Central Border Area Spatial Data project aims to establish a shared data set of relevant information on which to base a longer term spatial vision for the strategic planning and development of the central border area.It is within this context of national, sub-regional and cross-border interaction that North-South co-operation and collaboration on spatial planning is being advanced.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	935	The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.   I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 20 February, 2012, a total of 111,271 properties have been registered for payment of the household charge.  A total of 3,720 properties have been registered for the purposes of a waiver from payment of the household charge.The LGMA does not have the sub national details of the registrations sought in the Question.Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the household charge and the requirements to make a declaration of liability and to pay the charge by 31 March, 2012. The LGMA and local authorities have commenced a national information campaign to advise people of their responsibilities in relation to discharging their liability to the household charge.  A similar and successful advertising and information campaign was undertaken in the context of the €200 charge on non-principal private residences on its introduction in 2009 with further advertising taking place each year since.A household charge information leaflet is being issued to residential properties in the State at this time. This leaflet specifically advises persons claiming entitlement to a waiver under the provisions of the Act, including those in certain unfinished estates, that they are required to register their property for such purposes.  This is also clearly set out in the frequently asked questions on the household charge website www.householdcharge.ie   and on the household charge declaration form.Further radio advertising campaigns and interviews, including adverts on social media and other websites together with other appropriate communication measures and initiatives will be undertaken in the period up to the payment date of 31 March, 2012.I am confident that those liable to the household charge will be aware of their obligation to discharge their liability for the charge by completing the requisite declaration form and paying the household charge by 31 March 2012 and thereby avoiding any late payment fees or late payment interest.

There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge.  An online system www.householdcharge.ie is in place in the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit/debit card or in four instalments of €25 by direct debit.  In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit/debit card or in four instalments of €25 by direct debit by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments are available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way must register their details by 1 March, 2012.A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.  In addition, all county/city councils have been requested to have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge up to 31 March, 2012.  I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive suite of payment options available to persons with a liability to pay the household charge and this is being demonstrated by the large numbers of persons who have registered and paid the charge to date.Facilities for the registration of domestic wastewater treatment systems are being developed by my Department and will be available from the end of March. It will be possible to register on-line or using a paper application form. To encourage early registration, I have decided that a fee of €5 will apply for the first three months of the registration period, with a charge of €50 thereafter.  Full details of how and when to register septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems will be publicised in advance of the launch of the registration facilities and I am confident that the registration options provided will be adequate and convenient for the householders concerned.

The detailed information sought is not available in my Department. Information relating to local authority housing stock, including the level of vacant local authority dwellings, is collected annually as part of the Local Government Management Agency's review of local authority service indicators. Electronic copies of the reports, including the most recent report for 2010, are available on the Local Government Management Agency's website —www.lgma.ie.Under the Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock. Given the constraints on new local authority housing supply, it is important that the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need. Under the allocation to be made in respect of this year's programme there is a particular focus on returning vacant properties to productive use. I intend to make an announcement in relation to allocations under the programme in early March.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	941	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186, 193 and 194 together.Since the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) commenced in late 2005 and to the end of December 2011 1,128 households have been transferred from Rent Supplement by Kildare Co Council.  Of these 546 were housed directly under RAS and a further 582 were accommodated under other social housing options.Each local authority is responsible for the effective and efficient management of the RAS within its own area, including the management of vacancies that arise.  Notwithstanding this where a vacancy does arise local authorities have three months to fill that vacancy before my Department discontinues recoupment in respect of that accommodation.Accommodation brought into the scheme may be a rent supplement recipient's existing accommodation but where this is not suitable, or where the landlord is unwilling to enter into RAS, the local authority must source alternative accommodation. The accommodation sourced has to meet minimum standards for private rental accommodation. In addition the local authority must ensure that the ongoing housing needs of the household are appropriately met in the accommodation it has sourced.The core objectives of the scheme are to reform the approach towards providing accommodation within the private rented sector for long-term dependents under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme and to contribute to the attainment of better value for money for the State in the provision of long-term accommodation options. Housing authorities are very conscious of the need to attain value for money, and particularly so in the current economic climate. Value for money in relation to RAS can be viewed in a number of ways and can reflect both direct and indirect financial costs and benefits. Negotiating rent reviews and discounts along with the efficient management of RAS properties are some of the means my Department has advised authorities to utilise to attain good value and ensure the appropriate use of public funds.  A value for money and policy review study of RAS is currently underway and will be finalised shortly.The role of RAS has had to be adapted to reflect changes in the housing market and in the available capital funding for social housing. RAS is a successful programme which has achieved considerable output levels to date and delivered quality housing to a large number of households. Since the scheme began, some 37,757 households have transferred from rent supplement into RAS or other social housing options.

Under subsection 103(7) of the Local Government Act 2001, a local authority can, by resolution at a local authority budget meeting, amend a draft budget and adopt a draft budget, with or without amendment.  On 19 December 2011, Sligo County Council adopted its 2012 budget, without amendment, by majority vote.In order to enhance the financial management and audit control systems in local authorities, an audit committee, with both councillor and expert external membership, is now in place in each county and city council.  The functions of an audit committee are to review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within a local authority, foster the development of best practice in the internal audit function, review auditors' reports and special reports and assess follow-up action by management, assess and promote efficiency and value for money, review risk management systems and make such recommendations to the authority as the committee considers appropriate in respect of such matters.While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, at the request of the Sligo County Council, I met with a delegation from the Council on 31 January 2012 to discuss its financial position, including its 2012 budget.  The Councillor, referred to in the Question, attended and contributed to this meeting.  My Department is in ongoing consultation with the Council in relation to its financial position, including its 2012 budget.

There are also other administrative arrangements in place which enable long-term non-EEA lawful residents in the State to remain here on a permanent basis provided they meet self-sufficiency requirements.On the wider question of putting in place arrangements for persons from non-EEA countries who wish to come here and live on a permanent basis, my Department is continuing to keep the situation under review.  A major concern in this respect is whether such persons can remain self-sufficient while here.  As the Deputy will appreciate, a person's financial circumstances can change often dramatically and it would be highly undesirable for the State to be left with financial responsibility even where the migrant had at the time of their coming to Ireland every intention of supporting themselves without any call on State supports.

Local Garda management is aware of difficulties being experienced by residents as a result of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.I am further informed that, as part of the District Policing Plan, the area has been designated as a ‘hot-spot' for anti-social behaviour and continues to be targeted for additional policing measures, by way of additional foot and mobile patrols, by uniform and plain-clothes units, including the Community Policing Unit and Garda Bike Units, local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.   A Community Garda is specifically allocated to the area referred to.Local Garda management closely monitors the situation, including complaints and patrols being conducted in the area, in conjunction with other policing needs in the area to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences. Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.  I am further informed that the situation is being kept under review by Garda management.

Section 5 of the Act prescribes the conditions under which a court may grant a divorce. Those conditions are that the court must be satisfied that, at the date of the institution of the proceedings, the spouses have lived separately for an aggregate of four years out of the previous five, there must be no reasonable prospect of reconciliation, and proper provision must be made for each of the spouses and any dependent member of the family. The Courts decide each case on its individual merits and will take into account representations made on behalf of either party.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	951	The Personal Insolvency Bill, the Heads of which I published on 25 January 2012, introduces a number of new non-judicial debt settlement systems. The Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for a system of debt settlement between a debtor and two or more creditors to repay an amount of unsecured consumer type debt only (of €20,001 and over) over a set period.With the required assistance of a personal insolvency trustee, the debtor may apply to the Insolvency Service for a Protective Certificate in respect of preparation of a DSA. If granted, the Certificate would provide for a standstill period of 30 days during which creditors may not take action against the debtor. The trustee would then put forward a DSA to creditors for agreement. The DSA requires the approval of 65% in value of qualifying creditors and, if approved, is binding on all creditors. If approved, the Insolvency Service would provide formal registration of the DSA. At the satisfactory conclusion of the DSA all debts covered by it would be discharged. The Insolvency Service will have no role in the negotiation and agreement of a DSA. (Similar systems operate in the UK, Northern Ireland and Australia).If the creditors do not agree to the DSA, then the arrangement fails and the creditors can seek enforcement of the debt through other means.

The position is unchanged since then.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th September, 2005, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.The person concerned was subsequently notified of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section  3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before  a final decision is made.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	954	The legal basis for Council Directive 2011/95/EU of 13 December 2011, on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted, ("the Qualification Directive") is Article 78 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  Accordingly, the provisions of the  Protocol on the position of Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU apply.In accordance with Articles 1, 2 and Article 4(a)(1) of the Protocol, Ireland did not participate in the adoption of the Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  This is without prejudice to Article 4 of the Protocol under which Ireland may at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council notify its intention to the Council and to the Commission that it wishes to accept (opt-in to) the measure.The question of opting-in to the Qualification Directive will be considered in the light of the outcome of negotiations on the other elements of the package of measures which comprise the second phase of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	955	I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy has not been granted leave to remain in the State.The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order, signed on 25 January 2005, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim and his application for subsidiary protection, and a detailed examination of the representations he submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The person concerned has since 2005 been, and remains, under a continuing obligation to remove himself from the State but has failed to do so. If the individual concerned does not remove himself from the State, the enforcement of the Deportation Order becomes an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The person concerned was informed of this and the reasons for it in a letter issued on 24th March, 2011.There is no provision under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended for appeal in relation to an application for a certificate of naturalisation. However, the person concerned may make a new application to INIS at any time.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

In that context I am advised by the Garda authorities that Garda records in relation to sporting fixtures, concerts and festivals are not maintained in a format which provides a breakdown of the costs incurred in policing these events.  I am further informed that the extraction of such data would require a significant and disproportionate use of Garda resources.However, the Garda authorities have advised me that the amounts reimbursed to An Garda Síochána under section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 in respect of charges for non-public duty for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 were €4,377,945, €3,349,989 and €4,068,014 respectively.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	958	The Gardaí are devoting all the necessary resources to the investigation of the serious crimes referred to by the Deputy and have my full support.An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan for 2012 reflects the priorities which I set for the current year and includes as a strategic goal the objective of confronting serious crime in all its forms. The Gardaí employ multi-disciplinary, intelligence-led approaches to ensure the activities and resources of individuals and groups involved in all criminal enterprises are effectively targeted.  A wide range of legislative powers are in place to support the investigation and detection of serious crime, including through covert surveillance, and very serious penalties have been introduced for firearms and organised crime offences.I want to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of An Garda Síochána to counteract this type of crime and of the many achievements which they have had in this regard.While recently enacted legislation to tackle organised crime and targeted policing is being fully utilised by An Garda Síochána, I am keeping the legislation under review.  In particular, I have requested my Department to review the operation of the organised crime provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 to see if its provisions can be strengthened.Despite constraints on public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place and these must be seen in the context of the programme of modernisation which is being delivered in An Garda Síochána under the Croke Park Agreement.  I have full confidence in the Commissioner and the members of the Force in continuing on the delivery of this reform so as to provide effective front-line policing and investigate and detect serious crimes of the kind referred to by the Deputy.

I have no function in relation to the entirely separate issue of the Oral History Belfast Project.As for the question of any request to arrest any individuals within this jurisdiction in relation to offences committed in another jurisdiction, there are well-established procedures under the European Arrest Warrant for dealing with any such requests.

This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.As with previous rounds of consolidation under the Defence Forces modernisation programme any barracks, once vacated, will be disposed of with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure. Since the announcement of the Government decision on barrack closures my Department has written to each Government Department and various agencies and local authorities seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures. There have been preliminary discussions between officials of my Department and some other State agencies in relation to Kickham Barracks Clonmel but these discussions are at early stages.

In order to benefit from payment in respect of the leased/rented land, the farmer must be actively farming the land and it must form part of his or her farming enterprise. The land must meet all of the requirements set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes including the requirements relating to land eligibility, definition of a land parcel, etc.

Following correspondence with my Department, the person named declared he did not have the right to declare this parcel on his Single Payment Scheme.  The application was then processed as per the Terms and Conditions of the Single Payment Scheme, based on the governing EU Regulations, resulting in no payment being due to the person named as the dual claimed parcels exceeded 20% of his application.Unfortunately, given the rules of the Scheme and given that the person named confirmed that he did not have the right to claim the land in question, no payment is due to the person named under the 2011 Scheme. However, should there be any mitigating circumstances which have not been advised to my Department, the person named is, of course, free to outline these, in writing, to the SPS Payments Unit, in Portlaoise, where the case will be subject of a thorough review.   If the review is not satisfactory, there is also the right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.

During these checks a query arose in respect of land parcels declared which requires digitisation of the areas concerned. This is being dealt with by my Department at present and once the digitisation process has been completed, the application will be processed with a view to making payment at the earliest opportunity.

Whilst my Department has encouraged growers to become actively involved in Producer Organisations, I have to recognise that currently difficulties are being experienced across a number of Member States in implementing the Scheme.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	966	Over the past year, I and my Department have been extremely active in raising the question of an adjustment to the milk quota regime at every appropriate opportunity.  We have made determined efforts to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German and Estonian counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bi-lateral meetings with other Member States.  We will continue to pursue this matter over the coming months.Among the options discussed in relation to a soft landing are the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, a further reduction in butterfat correction levels, or a kind of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would operate provided EU production overall was within quota.  Most attention has been focussed on the butterfat correction, and in December a coalition of Member States involving Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Cyprus formally put a specific proposal to the Special Committee for Agriculture for an adjustment to the butterfat correction mechanism.Unfortunately, the Commission has consistently resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  This is a view which is supported by a number of Member States, some of which are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.Irish dairy farmers must therefore continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the milk quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check.  This is extremely important, and I cannot emphasise the point strongly enough.  Milk deliveries in the 2010/2011 milk quota year were only just below quota, and deliveries in 2011/2012 to date continue to run almost on quota.  With a super levy an increasing likelihood in the final years before quota abolition, all dairy farmers must carefully plan their production activities and pay close attention to the limitations imposed by the quota regime if they are to avoid potentially ruinous super levy fines.

The register is administered by Teagasc, and I understand that 589 such partnerships are currently registered with Teagasc.Against the background of the ending of the legal basis for Milk Production Partnership in April 2015, the increased interest being expressed by other sectors of the farming community in farm partnerships, and the undoubted benefits collaborative arrangements between farmers, I am exploring means of encouraging participation in farm partnerships including through the removal of administrative barriers in the context of access to Department schemes. In that context I am also considering whether there is a need to extend the current registration system to other forms of farm partnership. Given that there is no such system in place at present, I am not in a position to provide the additional information requested by the Deputy.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	978	I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

From then on, funding and oversight became the responsibility of those bodies.There were no projects mainstreamed to the Department of Health.  However, I can confirm that 65 projects were mainstreamed to the relevant former Health Board areas.  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested regarding the funding provided to the projects from 2001 to date.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	983	Funding is included in the HSE Capital Plan to provide for planned infrastructural developments for the National Forensic Mental Health Service.  These include the development of a new 120 bed hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital (CMH), the development of a 10 bed Intellectual Disability Forensic Mental Health Unit, a 10 bed Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Unit, as well as four regional Intensive Care Rehabilitation Units (ICRUs).It is planned to build the new CMH, the Intellectual Disability and Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Units at Portrane, Co. Dublin.  The HSE has sought expressions of interest for the design team for this project and it is hoped that work on the design will commence in the coming months.  It is envisaged that construction will start in 2014 and the facility will be completed and operational by 2016.The regional ICRUs will be located at appropriate locations around the country and will serve as a gateway between the community mental health service and the forensic service.  One of the ICRUs will be located at Portrane and a decision on the regional locations for the remaining three units will be finalised shortly.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	985	My Department has received a draft report from the independent academic researcher who was appointed to complete a report into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.I have asked the Attorney General to consider the draft report.  Subject to her views, I propose to make the draft report available for consultation by interested parties.  The draft report will then be finalised by the academic researcher, taking account of the consultative process and any legal considerations.  I will consider the full report when it has been finalised, and I will then make decisions regarding the appropriate next steps.  I am very conscious of the distress that this procedure has caused to a number of women in the past and recognise the pain that this issue has caused to those affected by it.  The Government is committed to dealing with it sensitively, so that if at all possible, closure can be brought to those affected by it.  In the first instance, it is important to make sure that the health needs of those who have had a symphysiotomy are met quickly and effectively.With this in mind I am committed to ensuring that the greatest possible supports and services are made available to women who continue to suffer effects of having undergone this procedure.  The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place.  These include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.The provision of these necessary support services for women is monitored and overseen by the HSE who are committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who underwent a symphysiotomy.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	987	The Deputy will be aware that the HSE is facing challenges in respect of all services in 2012.  In the case of Community Nursing Units for Older People these include, inter alia, challenges around the age and structure of the units.  The Minister has requested that the HSE provide him with a plan which seeks to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available.Any capital development, including grants for the construction or refurbishment of public nursing homes, must be considered in the context of the overall HSE capital programme.  This is a multi-annual programme which is developed over a rolling five year period.  In drawing up its capital programme the HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within the overall capital funding allocation.  In order to comply with regulatory requirements, the HSE is now concentrating on the refurbishment and upgrade of existing accommodation.

The HSE is currently reviewing its cost of care.  This will take account of the effect of the ‘grace period' for staff retiring on current costs.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	995	The driver licensing regime is defined in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006), as amended.  The supporting documentation required in conjunction with an application for the issue or renewal of a driving licence is set out in the statutory application form D.401.  The currently valid version of this form is defined in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 544 of 2010).  Section G of the form requires the submission of the current licence with the application.  The text of the regulations also makes clear that the current licence should accompany the application.  I note that, in the case to which the Deputy refers, a copy of the current licence, rather than the licence itself, has been submitted.   In addition, Regulation 54 of the Regulations of 2006 allows the licensing authority to request as evidence of identity any of a number of types of document, of which a passport is one.  The Immigration Certificate of Registration, commonly referred to as a GNIB card, is not one of the listed forms of documentation.  However, there are thirteen different types of documentation which the licensing authority, in this case the Motor Taxation Office (MTO) of Dublin City Council, may accept.   I would suggest that a reasonable solution could be found as to which form of identification the MTO might accept, especially given that the individual concerned has already received an Irish driving licence.  The application must, however, be accompanied by the original licence and not a copy.In regard to the Deputy's request that I review this case, the licensing of drivers operates through the MTOs of the local authorities, and I have no authority over their operation.

The public were notified of the RPA's intention to make the by-laws by way of newspaper notices published on that day. The RPA did not receive any observations or submissions from members of the public within the statutory period.The RPA has consistently stated that passenger safety is paramount and that neither RPA nor Veolia will do anything which might jeopardise the safety of Luas passengers. It is the view of RPA and Veolia that the services and capacity of Luas do not permit the safe segregated carriage of bicycles on Luas at present. Bicycles which are folded are permitted.Due to the continued success and increased patronage of Luas during the peak and off-peak periods, spare capacity or the provision of a safe defined/segregated storage area on Luas is not available. There is no easily identified off-peak period as part of the success of Luas has been its ability to attract non-commuter passengers to the service.I conveyed my consent to the by-laws on 6 January 2012 and the Light Railway (Regulation of Travel and Use) Bye-Laws 2012 (S.I. No. 44 of 2012) were signed by the RPA on 3 February 2012.
