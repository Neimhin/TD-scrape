          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to outline the progress he has made in extending free travel to recipients of Irish pensions resident in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to put new procedures in place to speed up the processing of forms for agents collecting social welfare payments on behalf of claimants who are unable to cash their payable order books due to illness or loss of mobility; and if he will consider providing special priority envelopes for such applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator White of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to outline the number of older people categorised as "delayed discharge" in Dublin hospitals who will not apply for subvention for long-term care or, with subvention, would still not have sufficient funds to pay for long-term care.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to intervene with the Health Service Executive, western area, to appoint a school dentist at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, where 24 national schools have been without dental services for the past three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Mooney, Tuffy and White and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Ulick Burke may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_13">The role of the national broadcaster is crucial in terms of ensuring that all voices in Irish politics are heard and that all arguments are put by Government and Opposition. In that context, I strongly support the comments made by the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, in which he highlighted the refusal by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appear with him on a television programme to debate issues of crime. No Minister has the right to dictate or bully RTE or anyone else concerning the terms on which he or she will go on record.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_15">This same gentleman wanted to go man to man with a Deputy from my party but funked a debate with the leader of the Labour Party. If this is the start of the election campaign, we need a better response from the Government. It should not hide from debating the important issues of the day with the Opposition nor should it bully and dictate to the national broadcaster, which has a duty to make sure all voices are heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I endorse the comments made by Senator Norris yesterday on the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. He called for a debate in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could explain to us the rationale and the openness of the decisions it makes.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">A further issue which has arisen with regard to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is the appointment of solicitors and barristers to review cases. These people are selected on the principle that it is a handy nixer. There is no transparency when it comes to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal or accountability for the selection of people who determine the outcome of important appeals. The only condition is that one must be a member or a former member of Government parties. We need a debate on that issue and I want it to be held as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I agree with the points made by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the balance in RTE. From my experience over many years, the whole world appears to have dealt with this, including Ministers from all parties and colours. Ministers have often refused to sit in a studio——</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_21">——with people such as myself. I have grown sick and tired of it and I have complete sympathy with the comments made by Senator Brian Hayes. On such occasions, RTE should not back down, and I have argued the case with the body before. Not only should it not back down, but if a Minister does not appear, RTE should not feel the need to be devil's advocate on behalf of somebody who refuses to appear. This is constantly happening. It is the duty of the national broadcaster to carry out its purpose. This issue is not as simple as a Minister deciding he will not engage with a member of the Opposition, and it affects all walks of a civil society where Ministers refuse to engage with people who want to take them on. There is a wider issue at stake than what occurred last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Senator Mansergh has raised on many occasions the question of freight transport. A recent report by the European group based in Paris which examines rail transport pointed out that the growth in the number of passengers using Irish railways is the fastest in Europe. On the other hand, it indicated that the record in Irish freight transport is appalling, and usage is reducing. We have raised the matter in the Seanad on a number of occasions, and I recall Senator Mansergh discussing in particular the trans-Munster freight line which was mooted for a while before the new bridge was built in Cahir. That is merely a side note.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">In the middle of this, Guinness announced yesterday that it would move its transport of beer kegs completely from rail to road. Approximately 1.5 million kegs will be moved from rail to road transport. This is not the transportation of tissue boxes, but heavily-laden trucks careering unnecessarily over roads, causing traffic congestion, great danger and pollution. This also reduces a rail service which is there to be used. It makes no sense whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">What is Government policy on the matter? Some 18 months ago, I raised the issue of the reduction in the usage of rail freight services provided by CIE. I wish to know what is happening. Is the reduction coming about because we do not have an easily accessible system of transferring freight from trucks to rail, such as moving containers from one to the other? What is the difficulty? This reflects a problem which can be dealt with. People ask what we are doing about traffic congestion, and this is a classic example of a problem. How many trucks will it take to carry 1.5 million kegs of beer, not only on the main arteries but on every road in Ireland where there are pubs or Guinness depots?</p>
          <p eId="para_25">It is a crazy scenario caused by backward thinking, and it is causing great difficulties on the roads. I would like the Minister for Transport to appear in this House so we could explain that it is unacceptable to wind down transport and rail infrastructure when we talk of opening the western corridor and giving more attention to the Rosslare to Limerick line, etc. We should oppose this strongly.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">While I am used to RTE's capitulation, I am not used to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform running away from the leader of the Labour Party. It is a commentary on the failure of the Government on the law and order issue, the protection of our citizens and leaving them feeling safe on the streets, that the Minister is afraid to debate the issue with the leader of the second-largest party in Dáil Éireann. That is a fact which should upset this country. We are used to RTE, but we now have a Minister who is afraid to debate. Perhaps he is afraid of losing his temper——</p>

We should have less of the wind and more of the reality.

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_46">On the issue raised by Senator O'Toole, it has been my view that for at least 40 years, the Department of Finance has wanted to close down our railways. There is no other logical reason to explain why there is an obstacle to expanding the rail network every step of the way. Sheer pressure forced us to expand passenger rail, and the Department is clearly determined not to allow the same to happen to freight. It is an economic, environmental and infrastructural disaster to allow rail freight to be run down.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Regardless of whether it needs public policy, funding, etc., it is up to the Government to sort out Iarnród Éireann, explaining to the company and those involved in large-scale transport that the best option environmentally and economically is rail transport. We must find out why it has not panned out like this, and not just accept it. Every other country in western Europe makes extensive use of rail for freight purposes, and it is up to us to do so also.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I ask the Leader for a debate in the immediate future on the issue of water pollution in our rivers. The EPA has issued a report stating that one third of all our river water is polluted, with two causes of pollution identified as agriculture and sewage. One of these, at least, is a matter of public policy, and it is extremely serious. We discuss tourism, etc., but the entirety of inland tourism will collapse if all our rivers are polluted. It is an extremely critical issue and I ask for an urgent debate.</p>

A number of major charitable organisations are legitimate but others are only purporting to be so in obtaining funds from a generous public.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I am not relating this to a case which arose on St. Patrick's Day at the Sacred Heart church in Roscommon, where a Polish person was begging and had €11,000 in his pocket when he was arrested by a garda, Michael Finnegan. The person was yesterday brought before the District Court in Roscommon. This is just an indication of what is happening.

Given that we are pushing for the western rail corridor and other developments, we should press for further development of the freight service. As Senator O'Toole said, obstacles have been placed in the way of all rail developments. People even had to fight tooth and nail for the western rail corridor. But for the presence of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, in the Cabinet, the corridor would never have been sanctioned. I would like to see the timetable for the mid-stage to Claremorris brought forward from 2014. We should have a debate on this matter. Given that the timber industry is so important in the north west and there are timber mills along that line to Waterford, the industry would avail of the freight service.

          <p eId="para_125">Senator Glynn raised the issue of gangs from eastern Europe, about which we are trying to be sensitive and measured. Two months ago, my business was burgled by a gang of eastern Europeans in the middle of the day. We pride ourselves on the Irish welcome and try to treat everybody with the same respect. After examining the camera images a day or two after the event, I believe this matter must be dealt with by the Garda and other relevant authorities sooner rather than later, as people out there are concerned. It is a growing trend and a matter we in this House must raise. We must look for the resources to ensure the trend will be stopped. If what these minorities among newcomers are doing is not nipped in the bud, it could impinge on the rest of the group. We must discuss this matter and ensure it is dealt with. The people who carried out the robbery in my business carried out numerous robberies in County Roscommon, the west and all over the country. The sooner they are stopped, the better. They are giving their fellow countrymen a bad name.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">I agree with Senator Henry's point on rail freight. She also sought a debate on the proposals of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, which I think could be interesting. The Senator also referred to the elimination of young women's poverty and the step to education and employment. Women are hindered by the lone parent's allowance. We all make the case in the constituencies in which we reside. While the allowance is a refuge, it stops them working as one can only earn so much for so many hours. Many young women have told me that they wish to earn more but the allowance would be stopped if their income increases. We need a debate on this and I applaud the measures taken by the Minister. The co-habitation rule was ridiculous, with people peeping in windows from hedges, watching people going in and out.

          <p eId="para_180">Senator Feeney approves of the decision by the Medical Council. She said the Medical Practitioners Act must be changed and she hopes the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, will soon do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Senator Cummins, with his experience of dealing with freight into Waterford Port, is concerned about freight being diverted from rail to road.

          <p eId="para_182">Senator Ormonde spoke about the Guinness decision to transfer its freight business from rail to road. The Senator also called for a debate on lone parents, and I agree with her. This issue encompasses education, as lone parents can further their qualifications.

          <p eId="para_208">A number of the amendments put down by Senator McHugh seem to attempt to find ways around the law or ways for fishermen to get away with committing offences. The amendment under discussion is of that type. It appears to try to give an out to fishermen or to allow them to get around the law. I have no problem with fishermen having designated ports to which they should go. To accept the amendment would create a loophole and make it easier for fishermen to get around the law.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_210">All three points are essentially related. The Bill introduces law and in some cases reintroduces law that has been in place since 1959. There was much discussion on Second Stage and in the other House as to how we might ensure that those who commit minor offences could be exempted or facilitated by not being put out of business as a result of relatively minor offences. As I said in the House on Second Stage, the way we tried to accommodate the concerns expressed at that time was to have graded fines based on the size of boats and so on. I introduced amendments in the other House which allowed for offences to be taken at District Court level, where such offences cannot be dealt with at present because of the two cases cited. Late in the Dáil session, I introduced a new provision whereby confiscation would not take place for first offences at District Court level.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I tried to meet the concerns expressed by Deputies and Senators on those matters. I have the same concerns as Senator Kenneally with regard to the difficulties that this amendment would create. I have tried to balance the need to have strong laws and disincentives available to sea-fisheries officers with the need to protect the lives and safety of people at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Senator Kenneally made an eloquent plea on Second Stage, as did other Senators, on the need to provide safety measures for fishermen and the Senator spoke about the hazards fishermen face, which are acknowledged. In respect of this instance and in <i>force majeure</i> instances, section 36 specifically recognises the concerns, expressed by Deputies in the other House and Senators in this House, about the inherent dangers of working at sea by providing a defence against conviction for an offence where actions had to be taken in contravention of sea fisheries law to secure the safety of any person, sea-fishing boat or other vessel in peril at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">What Senator McHugh is seeking to achieve in this amendment has been dealt with in section 36. I refer to a case where a person can reasonably prove he or she disobeyed an order to go to a designated port or a particular place, or a direct order by sea-fisheries officers or the Naval Service and can show he or she needed to berth at a place closer to the vessel's location because, for example, a person on board was injured. I assume it is instances such as that, <i>force majeure</i> instances, to which Senators McHugh and Tuffy were referring. Once a person can make a case as a defence, it is up to the court to accept that or to make judgment otherwise. The spirit of Senator McHugh’s amendment is accepted and is provided for in a different way in section 36.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_214">I wish to clarify a point for Senator Kenneally. In doing so, I am not saying he is alleging anything or telling me or my colleagues how we think. Fine Gael is not looking for short-cuts or any route other than that of obeying the rules and regulations. We are certainly not looking for loopholes whereby in certain instances a boat owner or fisherman could break the law. That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I used the opportunity presented by moving the amendment, albeit in a roundabout away, to make my point. We are all agreed on grant aiding fishermen to improve vessel safety and other provisions in line with regulations on a specific instance basis and trying to ensure boats use the proper port or do the right thing, but when one speaks to fishermen on a daily basis there seems to be a complete lack of confidence in the overall monitoring of the marine sector. That is no disrespect to or a poor reflection on the work of the Department. I am not trying to undermine the role played by the king-pins in the Department and that played by the enforcement officers in enforcing the regulations. Fishing is not a black and white industry and that is where the problem lies. Many fishermen take issue with the fact that on the one hand they have to obey quotas within certain zones — Irish fishermen are obeying them — while the other hand, fishermen from other countries can disobey them. That is where a lack of confidence comes into the system. On a related matter, there is an awareness that there is very little monitoring and regulation of factory ships. I am not saying that is the <i>de facto</i> position, but there is an awareness and an appreciation that the same rules and regulations are not being enforced in terms of the operations of factory ships.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">We are not talking about a grey area where certain rules can be considered differently. What fishermen are seeking in the fishing sector is common sense. I know people who write legislation but how does one legislate for common sense? I was at a mass recently where a priest said from the altar that common sense is most uncommon. We have a job to do in terms of legislation, but we must appreciate that we have ambassadors within the fishing sector who want to obey the rules, have a sustainable industry in the long run and work with the Department and with legislators. We should be working closer with them in terms of seeking their advice and their guidance. There are many proactive people in the fishing lobby and in the fishing representative organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">This legislation is bad news for the industry. There may be a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel with the early spring not having been as bad as previous years.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">I neglected to refer to a point made by Senator McHugh on safety. I refer to the grant aid allowed for safety equipment on boats and so on. That is administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara. If there are delays or specific areas of concern and the Senator advises us of them, we will refer the cases to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I appreciate Senator McHugh's point about the lack of confidence in the sector as do my civil servants working in this area. The Senator was not criticising the Department when he said there is and has been a lack of confidence in the monitoring of the sector by the Department. I do not make a great secret of the fact that I am not happy with the number of sea-fisheries officers in place to deal with the huge volume of work that must be undertaken in this area. That is why we made a strong case to the Department of Finance last year, which was happily accepted, to allow us to double the number of sea-fisheries officers. That increase in staff is currently taking place and they will move into the sea-fisheries authority. I accept that everybody wants to know the regulations are being applied in an even-handed manner and assure the Senator that is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">There is a certain amount of self-serving by some people in the fishing industry. There is much anecdotal talk of what is and is not being done, of sea-fisheries officers discriminating against Irish trawlers and so on as a justification for some of the illegal activities they are carrying on themselves — let us be blunt about that. However, the assurance I want to give this House, as I gave to the other House, is that the Department is absolutely committed to trying to ensure that sea fisheries law will be applied even-handedly as it has been in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Every effort is being made to apply the law even-handedly. The sooner this fact is accepted by some individuals operating in the fisheries industry, the easier it will be for the vast majority of genuine operators in the business. Various fisheries organisations requested a meeting with me and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to discuss the future of the fishing industry during the run up to the debate on the Bill in both Houses. At that time, I clearly indicated we would meet to discuss the future of the fishing industry and to try to mend some bridges as soon as the Bill passed through both Houses and into law. I gave this commitment in the other House and as soon as the Bill passes through this House and into law, such a meeting will be arranged to ensure we look to the future, rather than the past, which we have tended to do as a result of our deliberations on the Bill itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister. I will not digress as we are focusing on the same issue, which is discretions. I am a firm believer in listening to the views of the person on the street in respect of every industry. If one was to ask 1,000 people living in coastal areas what was their main concern, the general response would be that we sold out our fishing industry in 1973. A second group of people would reply that if we did not take the route we took in 1973, the structural investments in this country would not have come about. The debate between these two schools of thought will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Fishermen constantly tell other members of the public that Norwegian, Spanish and Danish boats fish in Irish waters. Last night, a man informed me that Czech boats can be found fishing in Irish waters, although I am not sure if this is true. What mechanisms are proposed at EU and national level to deal with foreign boats which are exceeding the quotas and working outside their territories and in zones where they have no right to be? I am aware that whistleblowing is a dangerous word to throw around, although it has been raised in respect of nursing homes. Could a whistleblowing mechanism, whereby people could inform on foreign boats committing indiscretions in Irish waters, be introduced to protect the Irish fishing industry?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_172" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_228">I do not believe the fishing industry was sold out in 1973 but I do not expect many people across the political spectrum would disagree with the view of the fishing industry and the person in the street that ensuring a good deal for Irish agriculture was the priority in 1973. As a result, our eye was taken off the ball in respect of the fishing quotas we received. The situation has remained largely unchanged despite valiant efforts to change it, although a measure of success was achieved a few years ago. Much larger fishing quotas could be given to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The quotas we received in 1973 were sufficient for the kind of fishing in which we were engaged. The need for larger quotas has arisen as a result of the significant growth in Irish fishing over the past 30 years. Irish fishermen became much more effective as a result of a considerable amount of hard work on their part and large grants to upgrade their boats. What was practically a cottage industry in 1973 has now become a major industry, which is very sophisticated and could handle larger quotas. We must accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">In respect of discretions and protecting our quotas, foreign fishing boats must notify the authorities before they enter Irish waters. If I recall correctly, they must notify the authorities on a two-hour basis when they are in Irish waters and must again notify them when they are exiting Irish waters. Foreign boats are subject to the same search procedures as Irish boats. I am aware that people either believe that it is wrong to allow foreign boats to fish in Irish waters or that it is illegal for such boats to fish in Irish waters but certain foreign vessels have legal access to our 200-mile zone. Every foreign boat in our waters is subject to two-hourly satellite monitoring, which notes its identify and location. The Air Corps overflies the 200-mile area every day, using the two aircraft we possess, and the Naval Service boards vessels, so nobody should assume that foreign boats are not monitored or are not entitled to fish in Irish waters. Some foreign boats are entitled to fish in Irish waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I appreciate the intention of Senator McHugh's amendment, which is to give people the maximum amount of notice. However, giving people at least seven days' grace before a notice restricting or prohibiting sea fishing would effectively undermine the State's ability to properly manage the State sea-fishing quotas and sea-fishing effort under the Common Fisheries Policy. The State must be able to act very quickly to prevent the exceeding of the quotas or fishing effort, for which the State could be penalised under the Common Fisheries Policy. The management of quotas and fishing effort is akin to a tightrope balancing act. If this amendment was accepted, it would probably be detrimental to the Irish fishing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I am aware that Department officials try to allow the maximum amount of fishing before closing down the fishing effort in a particular area. If they were forced to give seven days' notice, this would take place much more frequently in order not to exceed the quota. A considerable amount of fishing can take place in seven days and a considerable amount of precautionary measures would be taken. There would be a considerable amount of stop-start activity in the fishing industry because officials would decide to close down efforts seven days early if they were found to be within 100 tonnes or 1,000 tonnes of a quota in a particular area because there are so many vessels operating which could exceed their quota in the next seven days.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Everyone agrees that the system is not perfect but what is being proposed in the Bill is better than giving seven days' notice. Each vessel has one day's grace between the notices being served and having effect, which permits the maximum degree of flexibility and least amount of disruption to fishermen. It is therefore better to leave the system as it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">This amendment goes back to the original point about resourcing enough officers to carry out certain instructions on behalf of the Department. In terms of recent high-profile activity, there is a whole issue around who authorises instructions and who carries them out. I am sure the Minister is aware of the high-profile case to which I am alluding, but I do not want to put it on the record of the House. There are anomalies attached to how a writ is issued in regard to an infringement or indiscretion. Should there be better mechanisms in place to ensure best practice when authorisations or instructions are being issued by the Department?</p>

          <p eId="para_249">The proposal in the original Bill when it came before the other House was that the Secretary General should issue the authorisation.

There is no reference to "terms" anywhere in section 13 of the Bill as amended and passed by the Dáil. This subsection is merely about the authorisation of officers and it puts the onus for making appointments back on the Minister and the political system rather than on the administrative system.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">Given the history of the legislation and the fact that more than 200 amendments were tabled in the Dáil, the Bill has been debated at length among the fishing and non-fishing fraternity because of the concerns about criminality. There is a realisation among the fishing fraternity that if laws are broken, tough sanctions must be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">However, in regard to the grey area of the fishing industry, there may be legitimate <i>force majeure</i> reasons for certain indiscretions, and people are worried that serious criminal charges may be brought against fishermen. There is a major concern that gear will be confiscated. Comparisons were drawn with someone driving at 60 km/h in a 30 km/h zone in Trim and having his or her car confiscated. It is difficult to measure certain aspects, but the concern among fishermen is that their gear will be confiscated for minor indiscretions and the culpability will rest with boat owners. The whole area of criminality is a fear fishermen face and it has been debated at length in both Houses. There is confusion in this regard because the Attorney General seems to have a different view on the issue of administrative and criminals sanctions and Joe Borg, the EU Fisheries Commissioner, seems to be coming from a different school of thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">There is a danger that once the legislation is enacted, the horse may have bolted. I know the Minister has given a commitment to further debate the marine sector. The enactment of this legislation and the possibility fishermen may be faced with criminal charges is a worry we should acknowledge. We should consider the possibility of administrative sanctions as opposed to criminal ones for minor indiscretions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I fully accept Senator McHugh's bona fides and what he said earlier about his party not wanting to see any way around the law but he will forgive me for thinking a couple of his amendments, including this one, seem to suggest that. This issue is not really about fishermen but about transporters, processors and so on. I have heard of many incidents over the years where lorries have arrived at ports under the cover of darkness when there is nobody around and unloaded fish which are undocumented. There may be some genuine cases but I have never come across any.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I would have thought it was open to people to go to court to argue their point if they believed they were not aware of what was going on. I would not like us to send out a signal that we are, in any way, trying to be soft on these people who are causing the problems in the industry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_184" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_262">I wish to reiterate what Senator Kenneally said in this regard. In 2002 when the major review of sea-fisheries and sea-fisheries control took place, the Commission decided to move more seriously against countries which were not adequately protecting and applying the Common Fisheries Policy. An area on which it is focusing in the context of Ireland and other countries is the various links of the chain from the trawler to the shop where the fish is sold. The purpose of this section is to put that into law so that, as Senator Kenneally mentioned, people cannot land fish in the dead of night in ports in which they do not have permission to land it. I understand up to 15 lorries can arrive at a port, unload fish and disperse quickly to various locations. In addition, there is a fairly well-known practice where the drivers of those lorries travel certain distances and then, usually in the dead of night, other drivers take control of the lorries so that if they are stopped at a later stage by the authorities, they are able to say they only picked up the lorry at a certain point and do not know from where the load came. They have a reasonably legitimate way of getting out of being fined or otherwise. This provision is to stop that type of activity and the sellers of fish from selling fish illegally caught. From now on, if one handles, weighs, sells or transports fish, one must have the documents to prove they were legally caught and that one is not doing anything illegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">On the amendment, section 14(4)(<i>b</i>) states: “In any proceedings for an offence under the section it shall be for the accused to show (as the case may be)”. The Bill provides for the point about which Senator McHugh is worried, namely, that in the circumstances “it was not possible to know or not reasonable to ascertain that a regulation was being contravened”. If a transporter, seller of fish or otherwise does a deal with somebody and papers are presented which look legal, he or she will be in a position to go to court, produce the documents, etc., and make his or her case before the court. An individual will have the opportunity to do that under the Bill. The amendment is unnecessary because what the Senator is trying to achieve is already covered by section 14(4)(<i>b</i>).</p>

          <p eId="para_264">Section 14(4)(<i>b</i>), which Senator McHugh is trying to amend, looks strict but, as the Minister said, one can make a defence. On the point the Minister made, would it not have been better to include the wording that “the person took all reasonable steps to ensure...” in section 14(4)(<i>b</i>)? A considerable onus is being placed on the individual to prove he or she could not have known. It would have made it a bit easier for the individual if the Minister had included not only the wording that in the circumstances “it was not possible to know”, etc., but that he or she “took all reasonable steps”. If the section provided that an individual could go into court and state he or she did A, B and C, it would make it easier for the accused to provide a defence, which would have to be a reasonable one.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_265">What is outlined in section 14(4)(<i>b</i>) may be a different way of stating it but it is what the Senator suggests. I do not believe it is unreasonable to expect that people involved in a trade or business should exercise due diligence in their affairs, whether buying, selling or weighing fish. If they can show they exercised due diligence by checking the documentation which they know others should have, a court would accept that. There must be some onus on people involved in this or any other business to take reasonable steps to indicate they have shown due diligence. That is well covered in the section.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_266">The section states that one must show it was not possible to know. That is a much greater onus than having to show one took all reasonable steps. The Minister might look at this before Report Stage and incorporate a provision for a person who had taken all reasonable steps. That way the accused could provide a defence. A person could take all reasonable steps but it could be possible to know beyond that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_188" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_267">This is already covered, the phrase "or not reasonable to ascertain" is included. If someone bought fish without documentation and went to court, he would be caught. If someone bought the fish and asked for the documentation, took copies of it and subsequently discovered the fish were illegally caught and the documents were fraudulent, any reasonable court would accept the steps he had taken. It would be reasonable to argue that it was not possible to know the documents were forged or that a regulation was being contravened. That is a standard provision in legislation of this kind. It offers a defence but it does not totally exonerate the person concerned from making reasonable checks. The onus should fall on the person to make such checks and that is what the Bill provides. The wording is sufficient.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">The section provides, among other matters, that a sea-fisheries protection officer may confiscate fishing gear from a vessel. Subsection (3) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_323">Where a sea-fisheries protection officer detains in his or her custody under this section any sea-fish and the sea-fish is likely to become unfit for human food before the matter can conveniently be dealt with by any court, he or she may produce the sea-fish to a designated officer (where he or she is not a designated officer), and, if authorised so to do by the designated officer, shall sell or otherwise dispose properly of the sea-fish.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">While we all agree that the law must be enforced when it is being flouted, a level playing field is required. It is widely believed that this is not the case, particularly as regards large factory ships. Common sense practice must apply in the approach to confiscating fishing gear. We do not seek loopholes or ways to flout the law for those who commit offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">The subsection provides for a formal mechanism for the proper disposal of illegally caught fish, which are obviously perishable. It re-enacts the previous subsection (3) of section 231 of the Fisheries Consolidation Act without the provision for the destruction of fish, which was deleted by Dáil Éireann so as to avoid wasting food. This makes eminent sense and I do not know why anybody would want to amend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">As regards proceeds from the sale of fish, the value of the fish applies towards the fines levied. If there are no fines, the money realised from sale at normal market value is returned to the owner.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_330">In page 27, lines 22 to 28, to delete subsection (4).</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We seek the deletion of this subsection on the grounds that anomalies may arise in terms of the powers given to enforcement officers. Subsection (4) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_332">A sea-fisheries protection officer when exercising any powers under this section may be accompanied by other persons and may take with him or her, or those persons may take with them, any equipment or materials (including firearms or other weapons (where he or she or any of those other persons is a member of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána)) to assist the officer in the exercise of those powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is to be hoped that a case will not arise in which enforcement officers board vessels in an intimidating manner while carrying guns or other weapons. In other industries, are there cases where enforcement officers carry guns when addressing issues with which their Departments are unhappy?</p>
          <p eId="para_334">We are in danger of over legislating in the areas of fishing and farming. It could yet transpire that enforcement officers enter the lands of farmers who spread slurry outside a certain period or spread too much phosphorus. Fishermen who work within the law fear that they will be randomly boarded by officials accompanied by gardaí, even where there is no evidence of legal wrongdoing. I too have concerns on the prospect of armed gardaí boarding vessels and would like clarification on the nature of the weapons involved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_335">I do not see any reason to delete this subsection. There was much debate on Second Stage regarding a provision for firing into vessels. Some Members made a fuss about that matter, although I did not have a problem with it. I foresee circumstances where such actions will be necessary because some fairly unsavoury characters can be met at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Gardaí, Defence Forces personnel and people who are normally entitled to carry arms are highly trained and will not approach fishermen in an intimidating manner. On occasion, however, they may need arms to protect themselves and this should be provided for in the Bill. I expect that such powers would be used sparingly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_196" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_337">I have made my views known on this matter. Senator Kenneally is correct with regard to the power for the navy to fire into fishing vessels. Against my better judgment and to meet the concerns which were expressed, I agreed to the deletion of that section of the Bill. I hope it does not return to haunt those Members who pushed this issue and used it to hold up the Bill. It is now being addressed in other legislation. If any member of the Garda Síochána or a navy or sea-fisheries officer loses his or her life because of the deletion of the section, I hope those who advocated its deletion will apologise to the bereaved families.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">We should not ask members of the Garda Síochána, sea-fisheries officers or Naval Service personnel to expose themselves to danger. This section does not make it compulsory to bring arms onto a boat if gardaí or Naval Service personnel board alongside sea-fisheries officers. Subsection (2) clearly states that a sea-fisheries protection officer "shall avoid the use of force except" in certain circumstances. The decision to bring arms on board fishing vessels will always be at the discretion of the commanding officer. If a Naval Service vessel orders a fishing trawler to heave to and the command is obeyed without resistance, armed personnel would be unnecessary in most cases. However, where attempts are made to evade or if the commanding officer, in his or her professional judgment, believes the crew needs protection, this must be provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">On the issue of farming regulations, Senator McHugh himself remarked on the difficulties of life at sea and the treachery of the weather. Equally, sea-fisheries officers can find it dangerous to enforce the laws passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. We cannot ask them to do so with one hand tied behind their backs, which would be the case if this subsection was deleted. We do not send unarmed gardaí to stop bank robberies. Neither should we send unarmed personnel into dangerous scenarios where they could be injured or killed. Something may happen 200 miles out to sea, and, for example, sea fisheries officers, Naval Service officers or gardaí boarding a boat that is running drugs when it is meant to be fishing may be shot or thrown overboard. We cannot expect people to enter such a scenario. From that point of view I have had no intention at any stage of tying the hands of Naval Service or Garda personnel when they are doing their jobs. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_340">I am fully appreciative of the Minister's points. If, for example, the Garda gets wind of a bank robbery, it will send special well-armed personnel into the bank with good preparation. I require clarification of whether armed officers will board boats without any indication of malpractice or illegal activity. Will law-abiding fishermen going about their business be subject to random raids by armed members of the forces? It is intimidating and there is a lack of equality over the broad plane of industry. Do armed gardaí go into a bank that is not being robbed when staff are working? I would like some clarification on whether such armed searches go on randomly or if they will take place on boats where there has been indication of malpractice or illegal activity.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">It would be at the discretion of the commanding officer, who will make a professional judgment as to whether the law is being broken and if by boarding a boat, personnel would be in danger. As the commanding officer makes the judgment, it cannot be laid down in law. It depends on the professionalism of the commanding officer. If he or she feels a danger exists, the personnel must have a right to be armed going on board in order to protect themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I have not heard of significant complaints, although the power exists already, as does the power to fire on boats. I have not heard any complaints in this debate regarding any abuse of this power, or that raids are being carried out and people intimidated. The discretion must be there, and it should be left there.</p>

As we well know with our court system, God knows how long it can take for an appeal to be heard. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that a fisherman would win the appeal, but would have been without the boat for a period of three, six or 12 months while waiting for the appeal. This may arise even if the fisherman was not guilty of an offence in the first place. The legislation may be unfair to the fisherman in this case, and the Minister might clarify this.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_357">What is feared by the Senators does not happen in reality. In most cases, an appeal triggers a hearing in the Circuit Court, and it is clearly necessary to continue the security which applied during the District Court proceedings. This is done through financial bond or detention of the sea-fishing boat concerned. Most of the time, the person concerned can provide a financial bond, which is sufficient and continues through the Circuit Court proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I am advised that it is a rarity for a boat to be detained so the bond enables a person to go about his or her lawful business while the appeal process is in train. However, there may be a small number of cases where a person, for one reason or another, is unable to enter into a bond, in which case it will be necessary to detain a boat. The Attorney General advises that the Bill must provide for the detention of sea-fishing boats in cases where no satisfactory financial bond is provided. Not to do so would make a nonsense of the law. The fear that both Senators have is addressed by the financial bond.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">The principle of ensuring a real deterrent in the law applies here. Section 22(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill necessarily refers to the capacity of the sea-fishing boat. That ensures the State will not be left with mere boards, which may not even have scrap value, while the defendant retains a valuable asset which can otherwise be disposed of. In a recent case an owner did not enter into the financial bond to which I referred in the discussion of the previous amendment and allowed a useless sea-fishing boat, whose capacity had been disposed of, to be forfeited to the State. The State ended up with nothing but the liability for disposing of it. If a defendant pays the relevant fine, the sale of his or her sea-fishing boat will not arise. The provision will act as a deterrent and must be retained in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">These sections bring our legislation into line with most legislation as revised. The limit of €5,000 is an upper limit on a fine which a court may impose on summary conviction of a person for an offence. I underline the word "may" because it is not compulsory but a matter for the court to decide within that limit. We are simply setting the maximum amount that can be levied. The courts use their discretion by reference to the gravity of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed. The Senator will appreciate that the other House amended a different section of the Bill to allow discretion in the courts over the confiscation of gear. The level of the fine is not mandatory but brings the maximum to the level in most other legislation.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_379">Where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence specified in a Table, in addition to any fine the court may impose under this section——</p>

          <p eId="para_381">The phrase "The forfeiture of all or any fish and fishing gear found on the boat" raises a concern about when do we know that an indiscretion has taken place, if at all, and what discretionary powers officials have to board boats and decide at a whim that all fishing gear and fish must be confiscated if they do not have significant evidence. While my amendment contains specifics, what are the Minister's thoughts regarding the section in general? Will we be able to put in place safety measures to protect fishermen if they are not breaking the law or working outside quotas or zones?</p>

          <p eId="para_382">Sea-fisheries officers and naval officers may form a judgment and decide to initiate a prosecution if they believe someone is in breach of sea-fisheries law, but they cannot make a decision that a person is automatically guilty and confiscate the gear and catch at that stage. Rather, they will prepare the case for court, where a decision will me made on the confiscation of fishing gear.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">As the Senator knows, there was a lengthy debate in the other House on this matter. We altered the legislation to address the point made by the Senator so that where the offence is relatively minor, an indiscretion or whatever else and is a first offence, the courts may decide that they will not confiscate catch and gear.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">If a person returns to court for a second or third alleged offence, there is obviously something wrong with the person in question or his or her systems. If the court decides that there are offences, there will be an automatic forfeiture of fishing gear. This provision must remain. Adequate deterrents must be available, which is a cornerstone of Common Fisheries Policy enforcement and sea-fisheries protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">If the matter is relatively minor, as outlined in the Senator's case, and the District Court decides it results from a genuine error or indiscretion but not a serious breach of law, there will be no confiscation. However, if the person returns for a second or third time, confiscation will be automatic. The principle of the Senator's amendment was accepted, as we acknowledged that genuine mistakes might be made. We have allowed for this in the Bill but cannot go any further.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">It is difficult to imagine what it would be like for a fisherman and his crew to have someone board their boat on the grounds that there may have been an infringement of the law. That the fisherman may go through the ordeal of having his gear and boat confiscated and being arrested and held for a period of up to 48 hours is a genuine concern. We need to clarify how we can be seen to support an industry if we are prepared to take crewmen and confiscate their boat and gear on the grounds of suspicion.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">As the Minister said, these issues could be cleared up in the District Court, but a lot of time will be wasted by going through that process. For example, bluefish fishermen have already exceeded their quotas for this year. Time is important for fishermen. We need to deal with those who are flouting the law, but the men who are acting within best practice, guidelines and regulations may see officers with firearms boarding their vessels, have their gear and boats confiscated and be detained for a period of 48 hours when it may transpire that, due to some numerical mistake on a log book, they may not have broken the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">To put this matter in perspective, it seems that farmers may face six months in prison if they do not comply with the nitrates directive, a parallel I used previously. What process must the farmer go through? Must the farmer stop farming during the trial period, as it were, in which it will be determined whether he or she complied with the directive? The answer is "No" but fishermen who may be innocent must stop fishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Senator Kenneally is wagging his head like a little pup and thinks this is nonsense but it is not. Fishermen who may be innocent could step off their boats, go to the District Court and find that six weeks of their time and effort has gone. This is my concern regarding the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">This is an area of the Bill on which I have a difference of opinion with the Minister in terms of what we are doing, as many of the sanctions being laid down, particularly in respect of some of the smaller operators, are far too severe for silly minor offences. Such offences can happen even with the best will in the world. I will not rehash my comments on Second Stage when I gave a number of examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The matter relates to the administrative sanctions, which we must introduce at some stage. There is no hindrance to doing so, as it has already been done in the fishing industry regarding inland fisheries. We must move in that direction. I am not speaking about the large operators, rather the smaller ones in the context of minor offences. I had hoped we could have moved in that direction on Committee Stage or Report Stage. The Minister was reluctant to do so and I accept that he would have been required to return to the other House. I also accept his previous commitment that once this Bill is enacted, he will sit down with the various fisheries organisations and, between them, come up with some realistic level of sanctions with which we could all be happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I gave a number of examples, such as how an angler is treated compared with a salmon driftnet fisherman. For the same offence, the sanctions are completely different, which is an issue we must address. This is my major bugbear with the legislation and I ask the Minister to address it. I thank him for the commitment given to meet with sea-fisheries organisations after the Bill is enacted to find a solution acceptable to everyone.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_223" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_456">We have had a long debate on the amendments before us. I accept the points made by both Senators on relatively minor offences. The sea-fisheries organisations do not accept that we have sought to meet the concerns of those who make genuine mistakes. When the same mistakes are repeatedly made I become sceptical that they are genuine. Some people overfish by a small margin but do so on a consistent basis and this must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I have made an effort to grade fines as much as possible. Senators should not become overly emotive on the issue of naval officers being armed. We have dealt with the amendment that addresses this and the officers are not armed when they board a vessel unless it is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Concerning Senator McHugh's point, no boat or fishing gear is confiscated on suspicion. If naval officers believe the law has been breached a 48-hour detention period allows them to verify suspicions and prove to the court <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a breach of regulations. Once a bond is posted, equivalent to the value of the illegal catch, the detainees are free to go unless the court orders otherwise. The court rules on this matter and evidence must exist. This is reasonable and is comparable to gardaí raiding warehouses for illegal cigarettes. Such places would be sealed and guarded until the truth can be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Concerning Senator Kenneally's comparison between sea anglers and sea fishermen, I have no problem accommodating a minor breach and dealing with this promptly. However, I must also deal with the reality that large-scale operators are acting illegally to the detriment of genuine fishermen, about whom the Members are concerned. These large-scale operators are causing problems and taking fish that should be left to smaller operators. All Senators and Deputies accept this reality and the Bill must address this large-scale illegal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">This Bill must be enacted urgently. After the Bill is enacted we will meet with the sea-fisheries organisations and attempt to find some compromise. However, I will not facilitate those who are criminally involved in gaining an advantage, thereby putting the livelihoods of our fishermen at risk. Therefore, I will not change any provisions on fines in this Bill as they are necessary to ensure a real deterrent exists for those acting in a criminal manner. Those who operate genuinely and make mistakes, as referred to by Senators McHugh and Kenneally, may be accommodated in the future.</p>

A 48-hour period is insufficient to determine a person’s guilt. We should include my amendment to cater for this fact.</p>

If there is no point of law to refer to the High Court the decision of the Circuit Court judge on a conviction or dismissal of a case is final. While the wording of the section may appear blunt, one has the right to bring a point of law to the attention of the judge and request the judge to state a case to the High Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">The purpose of this amendment was unclear until the Senator spoke. The Senator's point is general rather than confined to this area of the register of fishing boats. I reiterate what I have said on meeting with those in the industry and discussing in detail its future. If there are anomalies, as the Senator refers to them, we can deal with them at the time. The amendment refers to objections and submissions, but these are not mentioned in the section. The registrar of fishing boats, with the assistance of local registrars, has the job of maintaining and updating, as necessary, the register of fishing boats without the need for ministerial intervention. That is a long stated position.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">This Bill and the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, which is being amended here, sets out the role of the Minister, which is to set policy. That is important. The registrar general has to implement that policy. The amendment would involve confusion between the policy-making role and the executive role and could result in a Minister becoming involved in individual licensing cases. The purpose of the setting up of the register of fishing boats was to remove any political influence and interference in this process. It has worked well and the rows that occurred occasionally over the past 20 years about one area of the country being looked after better than another and licences being issued are largely in the past. Everybody in the industry believes that the licensing regime is based on set criteria and that is how it should remain. It is not desirable to change that and therefore I do not accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_491">I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill before the House. As the Bill will amend a previous Act of the Oireachtas which has been amended once before and is of a technical nature, I will first provide the House with a brief description of the current law on international immunities. I will then explain the reason which gives rise to the Bill and set out its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In 1967 Ireland ratified the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963. These two international treaties were adopted in order to codify what is perhaps one of the oldest and most accepted fields of international law, namely, the formal relations between states and their official representatives. As is stated in the preamble to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, "peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognised the status of diplomatic agents". The two Vienna conventions recognise the functional necessity of diplomatic and consular privileges and immunities for the peaceful and efficient conduct of international relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Effect was given to Ireland's obligations under these conventions by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. This Act gives effect in Irish law to the two Vienna conventions. The Act also confers certain privileges and immunities on the United Nations and its specialised agencies; the Council of Europe; the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; and the Customs Co-Operation Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Part VIII of the 1967 Act permits the Government, by order, to designate an international organisation or body of which the State or Government is, or intends to become, a member to be an organisation to which Part VIII shall apply. Under section 40 of the Act the Government may, by order, confer on such a designated body and its officials "inviolability and exemptions, facilities and immunities, privileges and rights". In addition to section 40, section 43 of the 1967 Act permits a Government order to confer immunities and privileges on international judicial bodies or semi-judicial bodies established under an agreement to which the State or Government is, or intends to become, a party.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Act 1976 expanded Part VIII of the 1967 Act by the insertion of section 42A. This section allows immunities and privileges to be conferred on international organisations and bodies in accordance with international agreements to which the State or Government is, or intends to become, a party. It is not necessary that the State or Government is itself a member of the international organisation or body. It suffices that the State or Government is or intends to become a party to the international agreement which confers immunities on that organisation or body.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">As was common drafting practice at the time, Part VIII permits the Government to confer, by order, privileges and immunities in broad terms; the power to confer privileges and immunities is not expressly stated to be limited to matters such as those covered by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. Subsequent jurisprudence on separation of powers and consequent changes in drafting practice, indicate that the discretion of the Government should be formally limited in order to limit its power to make such orders to the types of privileges and immunity conferred in the 1961 Vienna Convention. The privileges and immunities conferred by orders made under Part VIII are in fact so limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The Bill will only amend Part VIII of the 1967 Act, as amended in 1976, and is solely concerned with the absence of any express limitation on the nature of immunities and privileges which a Government order may confer on international bodies and organisations. The purpose of this Bill, effectively, is a tidying up of the existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Bill will in no way alter the substance of Ireland's commitments or obligations in relation to international privileges and immunities. It will simply insert into the 1967 Act a clear statement of principles and policies which will serve as a limitation on the exercise of delegated legislative power by the Government. The Bill will limit the delegated legislative power conferred by Part VIII of the 1967 Act by providing that the Government may, by order, only confer those inviolabilities, exemptions, facilities, immunities, privileges and rights which are conferred upon, or afforded in relation to sending states or missions under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The types of immunities and privileges afforded by the Vienna Convention are as follows: the inviolability of the premises of an embassy of a foreign country or an international organisation; the freedom of the premises in question from taxation; the inviolability of archives and official documents; the inviolability of the person of the diplomatic or official officers of the foreign state or international organisation; freedom of communication; immunity from social security provisions; immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction subject to certain exemptions; and immunity from customs duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Section 3 of the Bill will insert this limitation into section 40 of the 1967 Act. Section 4 of the Bill will insert this limitation into section 42A, and section 5 of the Bill will insert this limitation into section 43.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Section 6(1) of the Bill will provide that every Government order which has been made under Part VIII of the 1967 Act and is in force immediately before the passing of the Bill shall have the same statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas. Section 6(2) will provide that existing orders regarding three organisations, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, the European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation and the European Radio Communications Office, are revoked. This is being done because changes in the structure of these organisations necessitates the making of new orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has prepared new orders which will be brought to Government soon after the Bill's enactment. To date, 45 orders have been made under Part VIII in respect of 37 different international organisations or bodies. A total of 29 of these orders conferred privileges and immunities, while 16 merely designated a body or organisation under Part VIII. A total of 25 of the orders relate to international agreements to which the State or Government is or intends to become a party, as provided for in section 42(A), and 19 orders relate to an international organisation or body to which the State or Government is or intends to become a party, as provided for by section 40. One order relates to an international judicial body as provided for by section 43.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The privileges and immunities conferred by these orders are of the nature of immunities and privileges afforded in respect of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as I have just outlined. The Bill will do no more than insert into the 1967 Act a constitutionally required limitation on a legislative power which has been delegated to the Government. In that sense, it is in line with best practice in this area. Diplomatic immunities are essential to the effective conduct of international relations and to the work of a wide range of international bodies. It is very important that the grant of immunities to such bodies, often in pursuance to Ireland's international obligations, be in accordance with best legislative practice. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_504">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and assure him of my support, which was offered when the Bill was first debated some months ago in the other House. As the Minister of State noted, the Bill will insert into the guiding Act of 1967 a constitutionally required limitation on a legislative power which was delegated to the Government so that we can ensure that the granting of immunities is in accordance with best legislative practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I am advised that the Bill seeks to ensure, in a retrospective manner, that all orders issued under the existing legislation to extend these privileges will have statutory effect from the passing of this amendment Bill. Could the Minister of State advise how many orders have been passed under the current legislation since it was brought to the attention of the Government that all such orders did not have the full and necessary cover of the legislation? This is not a matter in which there should be any legal uncertainty. The Government must have the ability to use its discretion to extend diplomatic immunities and privileges in line with the Vienna Convention and not leave any such decisions or actions subsequently open to challenge or withdrawal due to a problem with our legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">In today's more globalised world, diplomatic arrangements are part and parcel of our consular services and are extended to those working in Ireland on behalf of other governments or organisations in the same way that they are extended to Irish people working abroad. The legal basis upon which these immunities and diplomatic privileges are extended must be absolutely clear. Therefore, this Bill, while brief, is important and must be passed at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I understand that this legislation was promised in the Government legislative programme for the past number of years. My party questioned the Taoiseach in 2003 about the bringing forward of the legislation, which was promised for 2004. Unfortunately, there was some overrun, as is often the case in the work of Government, so it was last autumn before the legislation was presented to the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">As the Minister of State indicated, the guiding document for the granting of the privileges dealt with in the Bill and which are part of modern diplomatic life is the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which was signed in 1963. This convention notes that the establishment of consular relations between States will take place by mutual consent, that a consular post may be established in the territory of the receiving State only with that State's consent and that the purpose of diplomatic privileges is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of functions by consular posts on behalf of their respective states. The convention also notes that consular relations, privileges and immunities contribute to the development of friendly relations among nations, irrespective of their differing constitutional and social systems. This principle is at the core of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Ireland's increasing role on the world stage has resulted in an expansion in our diplomatic links with other countries, both within and outside the EU. I am advised that we now have diplomatic relations with 157 governments. We are lucky that all of these governments did not wish to have a St. Patrick's Day parade or there would have been a trip for everyone in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I am informed that the Department of Foreign Affairs has a network of 67 missions, including 49 embassies, six multilateral missions and 12 consulates general and other offices. This shows the scale of Ireland's growing and effective presence in the diplomatic field worldwide. We now have embassies in Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania and a resident mission in Malta, which opened last year. More than 300 civil servants from the Department of Foreign Affairs work on overseas missions and do an excellent job of presenting Ireland in a positive light and presenting its international policy on the world stage. They play a significant role in helping to attract enterprise and industry to Ireland, although this is not always their primary role. However, their selling and presentation of Ireland and Irish policies abroad plays a major role in selling the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">As we extend our diplomatic network worldwide, we must always be vigilant and ensure that we extend it in a constructive and responsible fashion. The decision to open diplomatic relations with Burma, or Myanmar as it is now known, raises questions. I understand the Government indicated in 2004 that it would open diplomatic relations with Myanmar. There are matters relating to Myanmar which should be of concern to the Government and to us as parliamentarians, as would have been pointed out strongly at the time by those opposed to Ireland establishing official links with that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">According to the head of the UN World Food Programme, one third of children in Myanmar are chronically malnourished, while the military junta which rules the country is responsible for an escalating humanitarian crisis. The pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been held under house arrest for many years and has also survived assassination attempts. Therefore, the decision by the Government to open diplomatic relations with Myanmar on a non-resident basis was considered very surprising.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Irish ambassador in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia is now accredited to the Myanmarese capital, Rangoon. At that time, Burma Action Ireland, which has contacted us on an individual basis and made presentations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and, possibly, to the Sub-Committee on Human Rights, described the decision to open diplomatic relations as a diplomatic coup for the military regime in Myanmar that would give much valued status to an illegitimate government. I am also informed that a former special adviser to the Taoiseach, Peter McDonagh, wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in 2004 which called for Ireland and the EU to stand against what he described as a very nasty regime in Myanmar.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">When we decide to open diplomatic relations with countries, it is important we do so in a way that promotes the kind of standards of politics, democracy and government which we would like these countries to have. We must be very cautious in our dealings with countries like Myanmar and avoid giving them any degree of official recognition or developing any links with them. This is the only political point I wish to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I welcome the legislation before us. As the Minister of State noted, it is brief but it is more than a tidying up operation. It is legislation which is required to deal with matters in a retrospective fashion. I trust it will progress through the House in a speedy fashion and that it will be of benefit to our consular services worldwide.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I extend a céad míle fáilte to the Minister of State to the House. He and I, and Senator Bradford, regularly attend meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I was trying to reorient my thinking that he was attending a plenary session of the Seanad rather than a committee meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I welcome the Bill. I read most of the debate on Second Stage when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil last September. It is euphemistically described as a technical Bill. I found it difficult to get my head around it and have a specific problem with it. In the context of limiting the Government's actions, how does the Bill change the <i>status quo</i>? What difference will it make? The term used frequently by the Minister of State’s colleague, Deputy Treacy, was that it was an unusual departure in that it limited the Government’s role in law. This does not explain what it means to the layman because it was further stated that the Bill is in keeping with best international practice. Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I was fascinated by the whole subject of diplomacy and went to the trouble of trying to establish where it all began. The term "diplomacy" derives, via French, from the ancient Greek "diploma", composed of "diplo" meaning folded in two, and the suffix "ma" meaning an object. The document conferred a privilege, often a permit to travel, on the bearer. The term came to denote documents through which princes granted such favours.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I was also fascinated to learn that in ancient culture women played a key role in diplomacy. When one considers that as legislators we are constantly attempting to raise the bar in terms of equality, in the area of diplomacy and international diplomacy going back to the earliest times, women were very much to the forefront of activity. Famous female political leaders such as Cleopatra VII, Isabella I and Elizabeth I were enormously influential in the history of diplomatic relations. Historically, women largely played a secondary but substantial role as the wives of diplomats. In 1923, the Soviet Union became the first country to name a woman as head of a diplomatic mission. The US, which began admitting women into the newly-established American career service in 1925, followed a decade later by appointing a woman as ambassador to Denmark. France permitted a woman to enter its diplomatic service by examination in 1930. After the Second World War, increasing numbers of women were making a career in diplomacy and more women became ambassadors. Perhaps the Minister will give us an indication of the number of female ambassadors attached to Irish diplomatic missions. As a Member of this House I have had the privilege to travel to several countries on Oireachtas missions during the course of which I have come across some exemplary women representing Ireland in the diplomatic arena. Many of them continue to serve at the highest level.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Of the 191 members of the UN, 113 have diplomatic accreditation to Ireland, with 54 based on the island of Ireland and 59 operating from the United Kingdom. I agree with the Minister of State that this shows the respect that exists for Ireland as a sovereign State and a small country playing a major role in diplomatic and foreign affairs throughout the world. I endorse the views of my friend and colleague, Senator Bradford, that the activities and professionalism that have been brought, and continue to be brought, to the world of diplomacy by our Irish emissaries abroad is exemplary. One can only feel proud in their presence for the manner in which they discharge their duties, not just at ambassador level, but at first secretary to third secretary level. The respect they have gained within their respective missions, and in their dealings with their host country's various personnel at government level, makes one feel proud that the flag is being flown by such distinguished people. I hope the Minister of State will convey the appreciation of the House for the outstanding work his diplomats are doing throughout the world to the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dermot Gallagher. He is a county man of mine, and I am proud to see him serving at such a high level for so long in the world of diplomacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Immunity rears its head in the legislation in regard to all of the organisations. The Minister of State outlined 37 organisations enjoying immunity. This has been the case throughout history. It became the norm that the laws that existed in the various host countries would not apply to diplomats or their families. The Act of Anne in the UK in 1709 exempted ambassadors from civil suits and arrest. In the 17th century, there was a famous agreement between the Ottoman empire and the British empire which forbade searches of British embassies abroad, exempted taxes and ensured there was plenty of free wine for the ambassador. I wonder whether these laws are still in existence, particularly the Act of Anne 1709. Was it revoked or does it still apply here?</p>
          <p eId="para_522">All of this history of diplomacy and immunity came together in the Vienna conventions referred to by the Minister of State. It happened primarily because the position of diplomats and the public respect they enjoyed declined substantially in the 20th century. This development, combined with certain other factors, including the explosive growth in the number of new states after the Second World War and an increase in the size of diplomatic missions and the increasing prevalence in international law of the view known as functionalism, according to which diplomatic privileges should be limited to those that are necessary to enable a diplomat to accomplish his mission, led eventually to attempts to restrict diplomatic immunities and international treaties. Therefore, the conventions to which the Minister of State referred restricted these privileges granted to diplomats, their families and staff. Avoiding controversial issues such as diplomatic asylum and focusing on permanent envoys rather than on <i>ad hoc</i> representatives or other internationally protected persons, the convention accorded immunity from criminal prosecution and from some civil jurisdiction to diplomats and their families and lesser levels of protection to staff members who generally were given immunity only for acts committed in the course of their official duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I was surprised to learn that all of this extends to 37 other organisations named on the record of the other House. These include organisations such as the International Cocoa Organisation, the International Coffee Organisation, the International Olive Oil Council, the International Jute Organisation, the International Fund for Ireland and many other organisations with which we are familiar, such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. One would expect that organisation to be included but I am surprised the other organisations are included. Does it mean that all the people who are involved in these organisations operating in this country, and their families, have the same diplomatic immunity extended to them as the international organisations to which I referred, the resident ambassadors and the ambassadors who are accredited but are not resident here who would enjoy that immunity when they or their staff visit? While I do not want to dwell on the subject, like most people, I assumed that diplomatic immunity applied exclusively to diplomatic missions and ambassadors. However, it appears that it applies to these 37 organisations. If all of these bodies have permanent offices in Ireland, does it mean that people who come here on a regular basis, and who are associated in any way with any of these organisations, automatically enjoy all of the immunities and privileges of diplomats and their families who operate in Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_524">It is important to continue to respect and adhere to the detail of the Vienna conventions because there are downsides. Despite signing up to these conventions, there are countries which do not recognise the immunities accorded under the Vienna conventions. The most explosive of these, and the one that is probably best remembered, is the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 by supporters of the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the holding hostage of more than 50 American diplomatic personnel for 444 days. That is probably the most high-profile example of what can happen when a country does not extend or is not in a position to extend due to ferment in the country for whatever reason, the compliance under the Vienna conventions to diplomats in the host country.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">A direct consequence of that seizure, in addition to the inconvenience and injuries perpetrated on innocent diplomats serving their country — it could just as much have been Ireland as any other country — was that it led to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the US presidential election and the election of Ronald Reagan. The Iranians deliberately held the American diplomats hostage until the morning after President Carter left office as another insult to the man who had tried to rescue them. This was a case of military action which exacerbated and inflamed the situation and it is an example of what can happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Reference was made to Ireland's diplomatic engagement with Burma or, as the junta there likes to refer to it, Myanmar. I will never refer to it officially as Myanmar because it is Burma, a state crying out for democracy. The sooner the junta is removed from there, the better for that country and for relations with it. I defend the decision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to accredit an ambassador to Burma because the concept of diplomacy, which dates back to the earliest times, is about dialogue. Perhaps I am as guilty as others but sometimes when people criticise governments for taking particular positions, such as this one, they confuse foreign policy with diplomacy. They are two separate concepts. We have a foreign policy on what is happening with the junta in Burma but at the same time, we can continue to maintain dialogue. If diplomacy is about dialogue and confidence, there is some hope we might be able to change the minds of those in Burma and in other countries which have dubious democratic credentials.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I welcome the Bill, technical as it is. Perhaps the Minister of State might elaborate further on how it changes the situation on the ground.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_528">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. I understand this is a technical Bill. Rather than an instrument of national or Government policy, the Bill inserts a constitutionally required limitation into the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, a limitation on legislative power as delegated to Government. Nevertheless, the subject of the Bill, namely, diplomatic immunity, is a critical one. It allows for the affairs of international governance and trade to operate and it facilitates many other actions and transactions we may take for granted in our modern, globalised world. However, its importance and foundations date back much further in our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The preamble to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations mentioned by previous speakers refers to the recognition by peoples of all nations from ancient times of the status of diplomatic agents. As a concept, immunity first emerged among groups and tribes in ancient times. Messengers were often allowed to travel from village to village without fear of harm in order to exchange information, even when they brought news of war. What must be understood is that although diplomatic immunity is in place today to protect individuals, as it was in those ancient times, it is not meant to benefit individuals personally. Rather, it is intended to ensure diplomats and officials can do their jobs. There is a tendency to almost automatically consider the immunity of foreign diplomats and officials working on our soil but, as with much international law, the operation of diplomatic immunity is based on reciprocal arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Under this process, diplomats assigned to any country in the world benefit equally from diplomatic immunity. This includes the many dedicated Irish men and women working on affairs of state on our behalf remember in countries across the world. Ireland has diplomatic relations with 157 governments and has a network of 67 missions abroad, including 49 embassies, six multilateral missions and 12 consulates general and other offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Ireland pursues its foreign policy in accordance with the ideals enshrined in the Constitution and in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter through the development of our bilateral relations with other states. Bilateral relations necessitate diplomatic relations. We further pursue our foreign policy goals via active and principled participation in international organisations. Again, this necessitates diplomatic relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Returning to the concept of reciprocal arrangements and the Bill, more than 160 nations are party to the treaties on diplomatic immunity. These are the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. These codify modern diplomatic and consular practices, including diplomatic immunity, and Ireland ratified them in 1967. They provide the necessary immunity to persons according to their rank in a diplomatic mission or consular post and according to the need for immunity in performing their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">This second element, namely, the immunity needed to perform duties, is an important one. As I stated, diplomatic immunity is in place to protect individuals and not to benefit them personally. Many of the contentious cases cited in international law are based on whether immunity should apply. Senator Mooney mentioned the Tehran experience. Another example which springs to mind is the Libyan Embassy. Policewoman Yvonne Fletcher was fatally shot while on duty at a demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984. Such is the status of diplomatic immunity in <i>realpolitik</i> that no attempt was made to enter the Libyan Embassy or to withdraw its diplomatic protection, even in defence of citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The two Vienna conventions reflect this functional necessity of diplomatic privilege and immunity for the efficient conduct of international relations. In the main, diplomatic privilege and immunity have been necessary and practical in facilitating relations between states. It is worth mentioning that no member of the United Nations has yet proposed rescinding or re-writing the conventions, notwithstanding the often high profile cases to which they can lead. Effect is given to our obligations under these conventions by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 which this Bill seeks to amend.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">It is critical that the Government's granting of immunities, often in pursuance of Ireland's international obligations, be in accordance with best legislative practice. Thus it is necessary to limit the discretion of the Government to make orders for the application of privileges and immunities. It is striking that the Government would bring forward legislation which actually restricts it. In this case, however, best legislative practice requires that delegations of legislative power be limited. There must be a clear statement of the principles and policies to be followed in the exercise of that power.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">This legislation inserts the necessary limitation into the 1967 legislation. Part VIII of the Act, as amended, will limit the privileges and immunities conferred in relation to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which may be conferred by Government order. The Bill will do more than what is constitutionally required and limit the legislative power which has been delegated to the Government. It is a product of our experience in international diplomacy and decisions in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">On Second Stage in the other House, this Bill became the context for discussion of a host of issues, including the UN, Iran, the Council of Europe, even the undocumented Irish in the US. I commend the Minister of State for guiding the debate on this legislation and for the publication and circulation of a specific explanatory memorandum in response to requests. There may be no onus or requirement on the Government to do so but it was, nonetheless, welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">These are the words of then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, in this House in 1967 when the original Act was debated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_539">The purpose of granting immunities to diplomats and consuls is to ensure that they are independent in the performance of their functions. The full range of immunities may sometimes be indispensable to diplomats to enable them to exercise their duties in the State in which they are accredited. The immunities which we make available to foreign diplomats and consuls in Ireland are the same as our own diplomats and consuls receive in other countries when representing Ireland abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Garret FitzGerald replied that he was "struck by the time it has taken to implement some of the provisions". Diplomatic immunity and privilege are as indispensable today to diplomats to enable them to exercise their duties as they were when the Minister spoke in 1967, perhaps more so. Our world is shrinking all the time as globalisation proceeds. We have benefited immeasurably from EU membership, international co-operation and open trade. Ireland's diplomatic and consular missions are an important, and often overlooked, part of that successful process. They deepen Ireland's relations with host governments and advance our international priorities and objectives, promote Ireland and disseminate information on Ireland abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The two Vienna conventions reflect the importance of diplomatic privilege and immunity for the efficient conduct of international relations, and Ireland's obligations under these conventions are set out in the 1967 Act. The granting of immunities, in pursuance of these international obligations, must be in accordance with best legislative practice. In this light, Iwelcome today's Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_542">I apologise that Senator Ryan, our spokesman on these matters, cannot be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">This Bill raises an issue we rarely discuss, namely, diplomatic immunity. I was struck reading the speeches on Second Stage in the Dáil and listening to contributions here, by the automatic acceptance that it is necessary and good. I agree but only up to a point. The Minister of State listed some of the exemptions and immunities conferred by the Vienna conventions. Some are self evident, such as the inviolability of the embassy building, documentation and communications, which are necessary for diplomats to do their jobs and represent their countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">It is not clear, however, particularly in the context of the EU and our relations with other states, why we cannot levy rates on embassies or why they should be exempt from social security provisions and free from taxation or customs duties. These are not academic issues. A year or two ago, there was an industrial dispute in an embassy in Dublin, where the trade union representing the workers in the dispute ultimately contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs in that country to put pressure on so the country would not claim immunity from Irish and European labour law, as it was entitled to do. I do not see why it makes sense that a country should be entitled to say it will not treat its workers well because it has diplomatic immunity and is not required to apply Irish labour law. Nor do I see why we should exempt European Union or other embassies from the general requirements of property taxation or the taxation of normal workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">This is worth examining. The general thrust of the Bill is to limit the exemptions rather than extend them but we take too much of this for granted and much of it is simply the application of the normal law of the land to the workforce in embassies. We should be slow to undermine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It struck me as odd that we seek to confer the force of an Act of the Oireachtas on orders that were made by the Government other than by Acts of the Oireachtas. Perhaps this has been done before but it is an extraordinary way to do things. We are saying that we may have done this on an <i>ultra vires</i> basis at the time but, after the fact, we have decided it should have been done by Acts of the Oireachtas and we now say it was. That is a strange way to go about things.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The Minister of State's speech is limited in its explanation of the genesis of the Bill. There have been court cases which sought to undermine the effect of Government orders made over the years. I do not know the details of those cases but I would like to know how the courts established that it was necessary to introduce this legislation to give retrospective legitimacy to orders made by Government. If the Minister of State has details on those cases, I would like to see them.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">My image of diplomatic immunity is that it applies to the diplomats of other countries and well-known international organisations which might have delegations here. I was astonished, however, to read the very long list of organisations, most of which I had never heard of. Why is this necessary if these are legitimate organisations carrying out their lawful activities?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_550">I assumed that was the answer but we should examine this issue. It might arise from international agreements and we are unlikely to change this practice unilaterally, but we should at least ask about it. Many Irish people would be surprised to know that the representatives of so many organisations they have never heard of are walking the streets with all these immunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">This Bill gives me the opportunity to raise the status of our embassies in Africa, particularly our heads of mission. We have a number of embassies in Africa, in countries such as Ethiopia, that do a lot of good work and administer significant budgets but which are headed by chargés d'affaires. This has been going on for a number of years and should be resolved. The political consensus to address this exists, although I do not know what mechanisms in the Department are stopping the Minister of State from doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I visited Ethiopia as part of an all-party delegation under the able leadership of Senator Henry. The amount of work the embassy does is striking. It administers an annual budget through Ireland Aid of €35 million and was dealing with issues relating to the EU Presidency, which we held at the time, which involved co-ordinating the main donors in Ethiopia, of which we are one.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">It is not difficult to think of other European countries, for example, Sweden, Finland and Austria, with which we have no bilateral issues and in which our resident embassy administers virtually no budget and is headed up by an ambassador. In Africa, however, where titles matter, our embassies are headed up by chargés d'affaires, notwithstanding the work they do. Given that addressing this matter would have no particular financial implications, it should be resolved sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">My principal purpose today was to ask a few questions and puncture the notion that diplomatic immunity is great and wonderful. Perhaps we should consider confining the privileges we extend to diplomats and consular staff to those required to allow them to do their work and withdraw those that serve no other purpose than to make diplomats' lives more comfortable. This should apply, in particular, to the embassies of friendly countries, including European Union member states.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I will be brief given that the Bill is technical and my knowledge of the subject matter is limited. The legislation amends the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, which was introduced to give effect to the ratification by Ireland in 1967 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963. The purpose of the principal Act was to allow diplomats to perform their duties by giving them immunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">As members of the European Union, we must conduct our business in the context of the globalisation process. For this reason, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations needed to be revisited. The Bill inserts a clear statement of guiding principles and policies into Part VIII of the principal Act of 1967. I am pleased we were alerted to the necessity to make this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Given the technical nature of the legislation, it may be necessary to hold a wider debate on the need to change the legislation. Perhaps the Minister of State would attend the House to engage in a discussion on diplomatic immunity against the background of EU enlargement. I welcome the amending legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_558">This is a short but important Bill. The origin of the important concept of diplomatic immunity can probably be traced back thousands of years to a time when a king sent an emissary to another king informing him that if he did not stop fighting, he would trample over his territory. The second king then sent an emissary to the first king rejecting his demand. If one of the emissaries had been killed, the message would not have been received. For this reason, it was decided to stop shooting messengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The Cathaoirleach and several speakers have travelled abroad on official business. Members are given diplomatic immunity when they travel on certain missions, for example, on delegations from the Committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs. Diplomatic immunity is important when travelling to countries where there is trouble or strife. I have no difficulty with proposals to extend diplomatic immunity to other bodies which have international obligations. As this is technical legislation which proposes only to insert a new statement in the 1967 Act, it is not necessary to oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I am amazed to learn of the number of bodies which enjoy diplomatic immunity, in some cases for short periods. They include, for instance, a group representing cocoa producers. Another body should be added to the list, namely, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, commonly referred to as the Order of Malta. Under international law, the order is a juridical body in its own right which maintains full diplomatic relations with 48 nations. It also has representatives or high representatives to the European Union, UNESCO, the United Nations, France and one or two other countries. Ireland is not among the EU countries with which it has full diplomatic relations. I have often wondered why the State has not established relations with the order, which has full charitable status here, maintains a large body of people throughout the world who are committed to entering war zones and places of famine and hardship, and does tremendous work establishing hospitals and clinics, providing help and succour to people in need and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Government should appoint high representatives to the Order of Malta and <i>vice versa</i>. I understand this was proposed when the late Brian Lenihan was Minister for Foreign Affairs but for some reason the proposal fell through. Perhaps the Minister of State would accept an up-to-date submission on this matter and discuss it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and departmental officials. I am aware the Department is known as a responsible, cautious Ministry which is almost impenetrable to outsiders. Nevertheless, it does a remarkably good job. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I thank Senators, particularly Senator Lydon, for their worthy contributions. I would welcome a submission on the Order of Malta, one of the organisations which acquired privileges and immunity under the diplomatic regime in place hundreds of years ago. Later, however, it was deemed necessary to discontinue the organisation's immunity, not because it did anything bad — it does fantastic work in its charitable projects, etc. — but because it was considered preferable at international level to extend immunities and privileges only to states and related organisations as distinct from organisations with no links to states. I would welcome a submission from the Senator outlining the reasons the Department should change the current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">On Senator McDowell's point of giving statutory effect to an order, the Supreme Court in the recent case of Laurentiu <i>v</i>. the DPP in 2004 held that it is constitutionally permitted to provide by an Act that a statutory instrument already in force should have statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas. Furthermore, it is not necessary to set out in detail the contents of such orders. The particular formulation used is on the basis of advice from parliamentary counsel and has been the subject of careful consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">On the general issue of diplomatic immunity the conferring of diplomatic immunities and privileges does not mean, for instance, that a foreign mission or embassy can absolve itself from compliance with the law. The Department of Foreign Affairs can be very active in this regard. From time to time cases arise in which the concept of immunity is pushed to its limits causing an understandable public outcry. My Department has made representations at official level to diplomatic representatives in Dublin when we felt the privilege was being abused. It is not a case that these entitlements can be automatically accessed once they are conferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Serious abuses of immunities would have an effect on the diplomatic relationship with the country concerned. The Department can make representations where a citizen feels disadvantaged by the exercise of a privilege or immunity conferred on a member of a foreign mission and it takes action when it believes inappropriate use is being made of privileges or immunities. While my experience in office is limited to the past 18 months, I was privy to discussions on these matters as a backbencher.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">I do not think that is possible. The convention confers the immunities, so they are absolute privileges. Obviously, however, one depends on the goodwill of states and sponsoring governments to ensure missions act in an appropriate manner. It is not a charter for abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I agree with Senator McDowell on the heads of missions of our overseas aid offices in Africa. The matter came to my attention soon after I took up this brief and I intend to address it in the context of the White Paper. I hope there will be a visible deployment of individuals in certain locations so we can give clarity to their roles. It seems odd that people who supervise budgets of €30 million and are involved in the serious business of developing countries and dispersing aid cannot call themselves ambassadors. I welcome the Senator's signal that he supports reform on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">On the issues raised by Senator Mooney with regard to female ambassadors, a number of outstanding women occupy positions of responsibility within the Department. Ms Mary Whelan, who heads our delegation to the UN in Geneva and accompanied me to the WTO talks in Hong Kong, is one of our more brilliant diplomats. Ms Anne Anderson, our ambassador to France, received international recognition in the form of an award for her performance during the Irish Presidency of the EU, during which she conducted herself with aplomb.

          <p eId="para_579">Senators Bradford and Mooney expressed their concern that diplomatic relations with Burma could confer legitimacy on that country. Quite the opposite obtains, however, because we do not link the establishment of missions with the conferring of legitimacy on regimes. We opened diplomatic relations with Burma in 2004 by dint of our presidency of the EU because it was deemed necessary in order to communicate our deep disdain for the regime's actions. We find the Burmese Government to be reprehensible and one of the dirtiest abusers of human rights in the world. We make no secret of our disapproval at EU and national levels. We are unhappy with the situation in that country and the regime in charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I recently had the privilege of meeting with Burma Action Ireland, which supports the Irish Government's position.

          <p eId="para_581">The Bill is intended to tidy up the legislation pertaining to this area. A number of Members expressed puzzlement as to why we introduced the Bill but we did so to be in line with best practice. In an ideal world, we would not have to do this at all. Issues pertaining to the legislation were raised in an interesting Supreme Court case but none of the measures under discussion was deemed <i>ultra vires</i>, as Senator McDowell, perhaps mistakenly, believes. The Attorney General advised the Government that the area should be tidied by restricting the power of the Executive to confer privileges and immunities which are not set out in the Vienna Convention. Our policies are being aligned with those of the convention so that there will be no wriggle-room for a Government to dispense fresh immunities. The Attorney General might be criticised for being too proper in ensuring that issues of untrammelled Executive power do not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I welcome Members' interest in the conduct of our foreign relations and thank Senator Bradford and others for their kind comments on our diplomatic service. The people who represent Ireland overseas are a great bunch and it is a privilege to work with them. Most of the Members who have travelled abroad recognise that.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_586">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_587">That, in view of the fact that cancer is the second most common cause of death in Irish women and that death rates from cancer are higher in women in Ireland than in women in other European countries, Seanad Éireann regrets the lack of progress in:</p>
          <p eId="para_588">—expanding the very successful cervical screening programme in the Limerick area all over the country;</p>
          <p eId="para_589">—the slow progress of rolling out BreastCheck throughout the country;</p>
          <p eId="para_590">—the failure to set up a pilot programme for colorectal cancer screening;</p>
          <p eId="para_591">—the paucity of clinics for those families who may have a genetic predisposition to certain cancers; and</p>
          <p eId="para_592">—the lack of equity of access to specialist treatment throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">It is important to remember that these initiatives are not technical or academic exercises. We want the establishment of good, proven medical practice to which people in this country, one of the richest in Europe, are entitled. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in Ireland among both men and women and represents a significant burden on the health services. The incidence of and death rate from cancer have been steadily increasing in Ireland during the past decade. This is due in part to the increased age of the population. This year the recently published Women and Cancer in Ireland 1994-2001, compiled by the Women's Health Council and the National Cancer Registry, stated we could expect 7,400 Irish women to be diagnosed with cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Early diagnosis of cancer is most important in effecting a cure. This fact is nowhere more relevant or obvious than in cancer of the cervix and the uterus. Last year a young woman friend of mine who lived in Dublin died of cancer of the cervix in her 40s. She was diagnosed a year earlier when the cancer had already invaded other tissues but it was too late for curative treatment. I believe that if my friend had lived in Limerick she would be alive today. This is because in Limerick a general cervical cancer screening programme has been in place for six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">In 1992 the then Minister for Health appointed a cervical screening committee to review cervical screening in Ireland. In 1996 it recommended that a national cervical screening programme on an age-sex register be established to screen women between the ages of 25 and 60 at five-yearly intervals within the primary health care setting. It took until October 2000 to get phase 1 in the Limerick area up and running. In 2003 a statistical review carried out by the Irish cervical screening programme found that coverage of the target population was 70%, well within striking distance of the international screening target of 80%.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">If invitations for screening were sent to Irish women they would accept and visit their general practitioner. Further examination of the programme in 2004 showed that it worked well. In view of this will the Minister of State explain why, well into 2006, we are still talking about rolling it out nationally? In her speech on the launch of the report on women and cancer on 7 February 2006 the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_597">I consider that the programme would be best rolled out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed. A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publically funded primary care services is being conducted at present under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and I have asked that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at these discussions. Any remuneration arrangements agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Minister of State should note that this mainly addresses the issue of how much it would cost, not how many Irish women's lives would be saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The survival rate for women diagnosed with cervical cancer throughout Europe is approximately 95% but Ireland is near the bottom of the league table, just above Scotland and only just better than Slovakia, Estonia and Poland, which have only recently become members of the European Union. Even then our survival rate exceeds that of Slovakia by only 4% and that of Poland by 12%, two very poor countries. The five-year survival rate has risen from 61% in the mid 1990s to 69% by 2001 but in other countries the rise has been far higher. The Women and Cancer report states "differences between countries in provision uptake and effectiveness of cervical screening are almost certainly responsible for some of the variation in survival". There is no provision for cervical screening for most Irish women, though we know from the pilot scheme that the uptake was high, at 70%.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Approximately 70 Irish women die each year from a condition for which a curative result would have been possible. The average age at death is 56 years. One could postulate that 40 or more women lose their lives each year in this country due to lack of screening. Families lose mothers in their 40s and 50s. This is not shroud-raising but represents the facts and without a sense of urgency this will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">At present we rely on opportunistic screening, where women attending a maternity hospital may be offered screening or may ask their GP. With the decline of fertility of women in this country and the lower age of reproduction, many women do not attend maternity hospitals in their late 20s or early 30s, nor will they attend as frequently as in the past because families are smaller. As for the option of visiting a GP, I was contacted recently by a nurse with whom I worked and who would by no means consider herself impoverished. She said that the payment of €65 for cervical screening by a GP or practice nurse would be a lot of money. She had checked the prices in her district and other GPs were charging €50 but that is still a lot of money for some people.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Minister of State will be well aware that medical cards, whether general or doctor-only, are not covered, although I could not get a quick answer from the Medical Council about this issue. We know that women from the poorest socio-economic levels are those who are most likely to develop cervical cancer, which is outrageous. We are still discussing the matter despite the discussion originating in 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Survival rates are good given early detection but in Ireland they are below the EU average. Between 1,700 and 1,800 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and 650 die from the condition. Since 1990, improvements in survival rates are evident but they are not in line with the better survival rates of other EU countries or the United States of America. We are at the back with the eastern European countries. To cite the Women and Cancer report, when screening for breast cancer, using mammography is effective in reducing mortality rates from breast cancer in the population. It detects breast tumours early and early detection allows for early treatment, which improves chances of survival.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">A good screening programme has been in place in different parts of the country since 1999 but how do women in parts of the country where no breast screening is available feel when they hear advertisements urging them to keep their mammography appointments to ensure they have a good chance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment and a better chance of survival?</p>

          <p eId="para_605">Hear, hear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_606">It must be dreadful for them and some telephoned me to say how distressing it was. Mammography is not available to people with medical cards, another area in which people from poorer backgrounds are discriminated against. The Tánaiste has plans to role out the programmes but there is no sense of urgency. How many of the 650 women who died prematurely in each previous year due to breast cancer might be alive if BreastCheck were in place — 100, 200? I do not know but people lose decades of their lives because of late diagnoses.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The European code against cancer recommends screening for people over 50 years for colorectal cancer, the second most common cancer in both women and men in Ireland. Early diagnosis improves survival rates. For years, gastroenterologists have been asking for the establishment of a pilot scheme for faecal occult blood testing, tests in which people send in containers of faecal specimens over three consecutive days to determine if there is blood in them. If there is, something can be done via colonoscopy to determine whether the person has a tumour. Almost 2,000 Irish people are diagnosed each year with colorectal cancer, the same incidence as that of the United States of America, but the survival rates there are 26% better.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Lifestyle and environmental factors are important in the development of cancer but up to 10% of cases have a genetic predisposition, particularly so in two of the cancers I have mentioned. Women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes or close relatives who have been diagnosed with breast cancer have higher chances of developing the disease, particularly at young ages. These people can only be seen and tested in a small number of family clinics in order to determine whether they have the gene mutation but there is an 18-month waiting list. What must those people who wonder whether they are at risk feel while this is happening? The same is the case in respect of colorectal cancers, in which two genetic conditions — hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis cancer — are due to mutations of a particular gene. This country is at the forefront of genetic research in these areas but our people are not getting the benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The Tánaiste knows that I have always supported her initiatives and those of her predecessors in setting up specialised units for the treatment of cancer. Our poor survival rates can be influenced by times of diagnosis but are also affected by the small unspecialised units around the country. I have implored politicians in this House not to ask for the continuation of these clinics and to think of the outcome for the people in their areas, not votes. Small units without proper team approaches are not getting the same results as larger centres. It is all very well if the medical profession must be taken on and politicians and the public must be educated. Our public and private patients deserve access to the best possible specialist treatment, which they are not getting. Instead, they are getting late diagnoses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I am privileged to second the motion tabled by my colleague, Senator Henry, as it is a crucial issue. I welcome the Minister of State to the House but cannot understand why it was necessary to table an amendment to the motion. I commented to Senator Henry that this motion would be easy on the Government, as it would not need to be amended. However, here we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">We have spent considerable time in this Chamber discussing gun crimes and deaths, driving behaviour and road deaths, but if we take the example of any cancer which affects women, such as breast cancer, more people die from this each year than from gun crimes and road traffic accidents combined. Why is there no outcry? Why is this happening when we have the answer? We can talk about controlling guns and changing driver behaviour and catching people who behave badly on our roads to bring them to court, which might or might not work, but we know for an absolute fact that we could possibly save lives in the area of cancer treatment services. We have the knowledge and everything that is needed. All that must be done is to roll out the facilities to every county in the country, but this is not being done. It is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The facts contained in the latest report, Women and Cancer in Ireland 1994-2001, and outlined by my colleague, Senator Henry, are startling. It might have been better had the people who wrote the report written just half of it, as one can reach a state of overload due to statistics. They begin to lose their impact. However, some facts hit me straight in the eye, as it were, including that the death rate from cancer of Irish women is among the highest in Europe. Why is this the case? We are the country with the greatest economic story in the last ten or 15 years, that has made the most progress and been set up as a role model, but we still cannot care for our people in a simple and straightforward way. It is inexcusable.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I do not know why there has not been a revolution due to this matter or how Governments can survive without dealing with it. I do not know how ordinary people everywhere can deal with it. Today, people from the west coast were outside the gates of Leinster House because of the salmon fishing issue. I went out to meet them and support what they are doing. Three weeks ago, boats from the west steamed into Dublin on a demonstration relating to the fishing industry. Along that coast there is hardly any access to the type of screening facilities demanded in this motion but people do not seem to be grasping this issue. Why is that the case? Why are more people not kicking down the doors of Leinster House because of what is happening in their areas? What has gone wrong? Why is it that the economic impact of farming or fishing in rural Ireland, which are serious issues in their own right, can motivate more people to get out onto the streets against the establishment than the issue we are discussing now, an issue of life or death? I do not understand it, although I have tried.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The only effort I can make to deal with it is if I read a comment in the fine preface of the report written by a woman who is or was one of the Minister of State's constituents, Professor Cecily Kelleher. She states that cancer was once associated with unremitting fear but that things have changed. I believe this is incorrect as fear of the word "cancer" still exists. Those who are not close to it are afraid and refuse to engage with it or discuss it. They are happy in ignorance.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Every time I read about cancer I feel uplifted as the stories are all success stories, apart from the greater incidence of cancer. The Government amendment to this motion refers to the reduction in the cancer mortality rate among the under 65 age group. While I do not completely accept this I assume the statement has been tested. We have easily moved from referring to dying of cancer to living with cancer. Anyone who knows someone with cancer knows that this change is real. People can have good quality of life seven or eight years after being diagnosed. A person who was diagnosed with leukemia 20 years ago was given a few years to live but is still living a full, happy life today.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The introduction of mammogram screening is a measure we can afford. Why is this not a priority? It would have full support and immediate results. Politicians are blamed for not accomplishing things because important measures take a long time to make a difference. However, this measure would make an immediate difference. Inviting each woman in Ireland for breast, cervical and other cancer screening would immediately save lives, make an impact on the quality of life in the community and benefit families. There are no negative consequences to this. The worst cancers might be diagnosed too late to cure the person but the measure would extend the life of everybody diagnosed in that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">What is the difference between cancer, road deaths and gun crime? If we do not make this service available people will die in greater numbers than if there were guns scattered around the countryside. Politicians may like to talk about matters where there is no clear solution but in this case the solution is absolutely clear. This is a cash investment with immediate returns, welcomed by everyone and supported by the community. I urge the Minister of State to apply pressure to make this happen. If it does not happen, we will face a revolution and we will never be thanked.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">People become angry with frustration when they realise an early diagnosis could have allowed a loved one to live longer. The Minister of State must have met such people, as I have. What is more important in pro-life Ireland than to protect and save life? A panoply of institutions, such as the Garda Síochána, courts and prisons exist to combat gun crime and road traffic deaths yet the issue of cancer has a more negative impact on society. We should take steps to improve the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Breast and cervical cancer screening must be made available to women in every county in Ireland. An information programme is of equal importance so people know the diagnosis of cancer is not a death sentence. If the disease is diagnosed early it is not a death sentence in the majority of cases. The campaign should show the success rate that can be achieved if people are checked.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">On a number of occasions Senator Glynn has mentioned the fear men have of being tested for prostate cancer. People do not want to be tested because of the fear of what they may find. If one is diagnosed with cancer one knows what one might not otherwise have known for four or five years and one can be kept alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">A breast and cervical screening programme must be fully implemented. We also need appropriate tests for those who are worried their genes may make them more susceptible to cancer. These tests are being done but it is too late in many cases. I also suggest we launch an education programme on diet, lifestyle, alcohol and smoking. This has been done to great effect with regard to smoking and the programme should show how these other aspects can also affect lives and how they can be controlled to save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">People will rise up and take on the political world and we will all be swept under when they learn what we know. If we were told 644 people would die of avian influenza in the next year nothing would stop us from dealing with it. Tests and screenings would be put in place but we have become anaesthetised to death in the case of cancer. In fact, it may be described as killing rather than dying because we could prevent it. Will someone take a class action against an Irish Government because a family member died unnecessarily?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_623">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_624">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_625">Seanad Éireann commends the Government for the unprecedented investment in the development of diagnostic, treatment and care services for people with cancer, particularly in the area of women's health. Seanad Éireann acknowledges:</p>
          <p eId="para_626">—the reduction in the cancer mortality rate among the under 65 age group;</p>
          <p eId="para_627">—the progress to date on achieving the target of 2007 for commencement of the roll-out of BreastCheck nationally;</p>
          <p eId="para_628">—the recent decision of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to ask the HSE to prepare the roll-out of the Irish cervical screening programme;</p>
          <p eId="para_629">—the progress that has been achieved to date on the Government's national plan for radiation oncology services announced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children last July; and</p>
          <p eId="para_630">—the commitment of the Government and of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to ensure equitable access to high quality cancer care to patients throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This matter primarily affects women but we all have mothers, wives, sisters and aunts so it concerns men as much as women. I would be concerned if a member of my family were afflicted in such a way. Much has been achieved although I acknowledge that much more must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Senator O'Toole referred to information on lifestyle towards the end of his contribution. The Irish Cancer Society gave an important in-house seminar on men's health in the audio-visual room. I attended, as did Senator Henry and others, and I found it useful. We are debating cancers that affect mainly women. We must acknowledge many causes of cancer. While it is not an exact science there is a fair amount of information in the public domain, however this information does not always reach those who should avail of it. The recent obesity report implies that our eating habits are of primary importance in preventing cancer. Although diet is not the main causal factor it should be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I identify with what Senators Henry and O'Toole said about the word "cancer", which conjures great fear and puts people into denial and delusion. When it is said that a person has cancer it appears that it is the end of the world, which it is not. I agree with Senator Henry that it is particularly important that mammography services be available on the GMS. This test must be available to people dependent on medical cards. As has been pointed out, it has a pivotal role to play in early detection and, in consequence, early treatment. Cancer care in Ireland has been transformed over the past decade. Significant progress has been made. It is vital we move on to make the full range of cancer services available and accessible to patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I will mention some of the achievements over recent years. Since 1997 additional investment of approximately €720 million in cancer care has meant the appointment of an extra 109 consultants and over 250 nurse specialists. When the Midland Health Board debated cancer services I argued for devolving certain cancer procedures to various locations. In this I was wrong because it has been proven, both in practice and in theory, that the greater the number of procedures that take place in a centre, the more efficient and viable it is as an effective treatment centre — I agree with Senator Henry on this. The key goal of the national cancer strategy, to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under-65 age group, was achieved three years ahead of target. A major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. In light of this in July 2005 the Government announced a plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. It is important that this be brought forward. It is marvellous to have an objective and, as I said, it has been proven that we have exceeded a target by three years. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick Regional Hospitals. This will mean an investment in additional capacity to the equivalent of 23 additional linear accelerators. The public investment involved will be approximately €480 million, most of it funded through the public-private partnership over the period to 2011. In 2004 approval was granted for €15 million in full-year funding to open a new radiotherapy department in Galway and to expand capacity in Cork. The new radiation oncology department at University College Hospital, Galway,  commenced treatment in March 2005. In Cork University Hospital the third linear accelerator commenced treatment in March 2005 and the fourth linear accelerator commenced treatment on 10 October 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">BreastCheck is one of the central themes of this evening's debate. There is a 2007 target date for its nationwide expansion and it is expected that this will be met. I hope we can meet it before than. The national breast screening programme commenced in 2000 and currently covers the eastern, north-eastern, midland and parts of the south-eastern areas of the country. In those areas free screening is being offered to women in the target age group of 50 to 64 years. Since the programme commenced in 2000, cumulative Revenue funding of approximately €60 million and capital funding of €12 million has been allocated to the programme. The investment has enabled the appointment of additional surgeons with an interest in breast disease, histopathologists and radiologists to enhance the delivery of breast cancer services nationally. To end 2004 the number of women screened by BreastCheck was approximately 185,000. The cancer detection rate is approximately 7.4 per 1,000 screened and to date more than 30,000 cancers have been detected.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">This Government is committed to the roll-out of the cervical cancer screening programme in line with international best practice. No matter what anybody says, whatever we have done, we must do more. Lives are important. Senator O'Toole made an important point on avian flu. The means of dealing with this are within our grasp. The hackneyed political slogan that we have much done and much more to do holds true. We have come a long way but we have further to go. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is caring, as is the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. If this programme can be accelerated to deal with the concerns of the movers of this motion and the many people who suffer from cancer, then let us do it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_637">I welcome the Minister to the House. I am happy to support this motion and I thank Senators Henry and O'Toole for their excellent presentations. I am disappointed with the Government's amendment and I ask Senator Glynn to consider withdrawing it. We all agree with the motion, particularly women but also men. We want to see the services provided as detailed in the motion. I ask that both sides of the House unite on this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I wish I could speak with the passion of Senator O'Toole, who brought the message home. Although this is not solely a women's issue, it is great to see a man expressing that kind of passion when speaking about cancers from which women suffer in greater numbers such as breast and cervical cancers. Despite the increasing wealth in this country the financial contribution to women's health smacks of lip service. There is a lack of understanding that investment in areas such as prevention and health promotion would have long-term positive benefits. As the life expectancy of Irish women extends into their mid-80s, women deserve a good quality of life to enable them to fulfil the important contribution they have to make to society. It is unacceptable that the lack of investment in services results in the death of many men and women. If the funds used to treat those who develop cancer were targeted at prevention, they would be much better spent and lives would be saved in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The figures published in mid-2005 by the Irish Cancer Society are not as shocking as those detailed by Senator Henry. I hope the Minister of State will be able to provide exact figures for the incidence of breast and cervical cancer and the number of associated deaths. The Irish Cancer Society figures suggest that there are 288 new cases of breast cancer in women under 45 every year and an increasing incidence of breast cancer in younger women. The small additional amount of funding required to expedite the rollout of the screening programme throughout the country should be a priority for any Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">One of the areas of women's health that is glaringly neglected is that of cancer screening. In particular, there are unacceptable delays in the roll-out of the cervical screening programme and delays in completing the BreastCheck programme. One can be lucky to live in the Dublin area or in other areas where the BreastCheck programme is operational, or unlucky to live in an area where the cervical screening programme, which is only available in one part of the country, is not in place. The rate of cervical cancer in Ireland is one of the highest in western Europe — shame on us. At present, approximately 77 women die each year from what is essentially preventable cancer. As this cancer mostly affects young women, it is a cause of death of many young mothers.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">In the EU, the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer exceeds the number of deaths from AIDS or hepatitis B. However, in some EU countries the incidence of cervical cancer has been declining in recent decades, primarily due to the introduction and adoption of national screening programmes. The facts speak for themselves. For example, deaths from cervical cancer plummeted in the UK since it introduced a national screening programme in 1989. In Finland, cervical cancer screening was introduced in 1963, with regular updates to the programme since that time. This resulted in a very low incidence and mortality rate for the disease. In Ireland, where we do not have a national screening programme, the rate of cervical cancer and mortality is considerably higher and results in over 70 deaths at an average age of 45.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">At present, in all parts of Ireland except the mid-west, the only way women can avail of screening is by attending their GP for a smear test. This is described as "opportunistic screening" and best practice suggests that this system does not work. Disadvantaged women will suffer the most and will be least likely to be able to afford the test. Therefore, we are compounding the poverty of such women, or worse if they develop the disease. Unlike many cancers, cervical cancer is highly treatable and preventable through modern screening methods. A national screening programme can save up to 60 lives a year and prevent up to 90% of cases. Smear tests miss 10% to 30% of abnormalities and, therefore, regular screening is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">In addition to screening, new technologies may soon become available, among which is the HPV vaccine. At this time, the most modern technology, such as liquid-based cytology, the most up-to-date laboratory technology for analysing smear tests, is only available to those women who can afford to pay for it. This could be an important tool in the fight against cervical cancer when used in conjunction with screening programmes. HPV is a known cause of cervical cancer, yet women are still not tested in routine Pap smear tests.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">If pre-cancerous types of HPV are treated early, it is possible to prevent cervical cancer completely. Potential prevention of cervical cancer is great news, but it is not a replacement for screening. A doctor from the National Cancer Institute in the US stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_645">We need to use the principles "prevent, detect, modulate and eliminate". We have the opportunity to put more effort into the front end of the disease instead of the end. We will not beat cancer with yesterday's solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">What he had to say is very relevant to Ireland. We are even further behind than the US in terms of tackling a problem which it is possible for us to tackle. It is a disgrace that so many women are not able to access screening programmes that should be available to all women. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that the funding is provided as a priority so these programmes can be rolled out as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">In the long term the primary aim is to save lives. Early detection will save lives and by achieving this, we will save the health services significant resources in terms of the treatment of women. Early detection is cost effective, not to mention the fact that men and women will survive cancer, which is the aim. In this day and age, it can and must be done. However, the Government has dragged its feet. As Senator O'Toole stated, women in particular have stayed far too quiet when dealing with this issue. In the time remaining to the Government, we want immediate action. I hope the Minister of State will impress on the Minister that this action must be taken.</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_648">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the House. Senator Henry's motion states "in view of the fact that cancer is the second most common cause of death in Irish women and that death rates from cancer are higher in women in Ireland than in women in other European countries". When one considers this issue coldly and clinically, it is clear that if one can pay for a private health service, one will not be in the group of people who die from cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">This point has not been made so far in the debate. We are talking about people who do not have the money to access private health care. In the time of the Celtic tiger, that is a primitive situation. We are excluding those who cannot pay for health care whereas others could avail of cancer screening, a cervical test or a mammogram today and receive the results tomorrow. We need to get our act together. One person died in Turkey from avian flu but there are 65 deaths per year in Ireland from cervical cancer alone. In 2001, 645 women died from breast cancer. We need an inclusive national screening programme, regardless of whether women are rich or poor, rather than the exclusive medical system we have in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">There are three medical people among us, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, and Senators Glynn and Henry. They are dealing with these issues and know about them. Vision is needed to cut through the waffle and the reports and to inform the HSE to set about implementing a national cervical cancer screening programme. A decision must be made to implement it and to treat all woman equally rather than on the basis of their means. This is not a women's issue but a family issue. It is also a man's issue because, as Senator Glynn pointed out, women have sons.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had the vision and guts to push through the banning of smoking in public places. He did not have much support for that ban initially but he continued to push for it. As a former smoker I suppose I cannot talk about the issue. I gave up cigarettes 20 years ago and did not find it easy to do so. Now we are experiencing the pleasure of not having to breathe in cigarette smoke in public places. The Minister, Deputy Martin, had the vision to deal with the objections and cut to the chase to ban smoking in public places. The Minister, Deputy Harney, needs to have similar vision in deciding to implement a national cervical cancer screening programme which will cost €18 million to roll out.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Dr. Grainne Flannelly, a consultant in Holles Street, who deals with cervical cancer screening, invited me to visit her clinic last year. She told me that women arrive into her clinic in a pre-cancerous stage and are petrified because they believe that once they get cancer, the chances are they will die. A woman who has a number of children and is on a low income would prefer to pay for her children, rather than herself, to be seen by the doctor. She will forfeit her own health to look after her family's health. That is the position in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I will support the motion on this side of the House; Senator Henry knows the position I am in.</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_655">I tabled a motion on the need for a cervical cancer screening programme at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party six months ago and I will raise the matter again in the next two weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I am embarrassed to contemplate that if one has money, one can have a mammogram tomorrow or the day after, but those who cannot afford to pay for it for themselves will use the income they have to buy shoes and other necessities for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Another important point is the prevalence of ageism in health screening. Like Senator Henry, I am mortified when I see the advertisement on television encouraging women who are under the age of 65 and live in a certain part to be screened for breast cancer. I point out the cheek of the bureaucrat in the Department of Health and Children who decided that women over the age of 65 should not be included in the breast screening programming in the areas of the country were it is available, and I will not go into the debate on why that is not available throughout the country. As regards the ageism aspect, there are words in my head that I do not want to use because they are too basic, but it is ultra-conservative social thinking and ignorance that ageism is introduced in health matters. Why should a woman over the age of 65 not have as much right to be screened for breast cancer as a woman under the age of 65?</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_659">Cancer Research in the United Kingdom has published figures that indicate that 75% of breast cancer occurs in women over the age of 65, yet a bureaucrat in the Department of Health and Children decided to cut off the age limit for screening at 65. I do not care if the research at the time indicated that was appropriate. If those in the Department did their homework properly they might have got the proper figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">We are here to make changes in society and at the end of our time here we will be judged as to whether we made a significant contribution. The Minister of State should press home to the Tánaiste and the leader of his party the need for these screening programmes. I am an admirer of the Tánaiste; I do not want to go over the top but I believe the woman is a genius. However, she needs vision to roll out the national screening programmes that are the subject of the motion tabled by Senator Henry and her colleagues, whom I applaud for doing so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_661">When one has been affected by the incidence of cancer in one's immediate family, one can appreciate, as I do, the extraordinary quality of service that can be available. I happen to live in a city where, as Senator Henry said, if one has the means, a high quality level of cancer care is available. When one is a politician, the incidence of cancer within one's family circle focuses one on what is wrong in the system, what is missing, what is uneven, what might have happened if one's family lived somewhere else or if one's family was on an income level that meant they either had to depend on public health and, by implication, could not afford to pay for private health insurance. A significant number of people are between the extraordinarily ungenerous level of income at which a full medical card is made available and an income level at which private health insurance can be paid for without enormous sacrifices being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I always find it a little distasteful to make something as personally sensitive to everybody who has encountered it — and those who have not — into a political issue. However, I am also concerned that while, on the one hand, this is a high profile illness, on the other, it is not an issue which on a day-to-day basis can grab headlines in the way that people on trolleys in accident and emergency units can. It is not tangible, quantifiable and immediate in the way that the scenario of people lying on trolleys in accident and emergency departments is.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Men will now talk about female-specific cancers like breast cancer or cervical cancer where they would not have discussed them 25 years ago. However, many men still believe that the issue should be left to women. Therefore, it frequently does not assume the central role in political discourse that it should.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We cannot dispute the fact that death rates from cancer are higher than they could or should be. We have had ten years of unprecedented prosperity and while some progress has been made, it is still implied that it is acceptable to have a rate of progress which leaves significant numbers of women at risk of dying young from cancers that are both treatable and preventable because either the treatment or the initial investigations are not available at the right time and in a location which these women can access.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I will now turn to the subjects of breast cancer and cervical cancer, which are mentioned in the motion. We know that breast cancer is eminently treatable when it is diagnosed at a sufficiently early stage. Treatment is difficult and traumatic for many women but the disease is still treatable. However, it needs to be diagnosed early. I understand that early diagnosis is extremely difficult in the case of certain cancers. Pancreatic cancer is frequently cited as an example of such a cancer. However, it is scandalous to have available to us the means, technology and skill to provide early diagnosis of cancer but fail to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">It is worth pointing out that the decision in principle to introduce a national breast cancer screening programme was made during the tenure of the rainbow Government. This decision was taken ten years ago at a time when the country was possibly in the first year of its spectacular and welcome economic growth which saw it catch up with the rest of western Europe. We are now told that the screening programme will be rolled out 11 years later in 2007. Those of us living in Cork will wait to see it rolled out and fully established. I have heard some of the very dedicated staff connected with the programme explain the logistical problems but I am also aware that resource issues delayed decisions at various stages. Possibly resource issues do not delay decisions now but there is no doubt that it took a long time and a ferocious political campaign to secure the decision in principle to move from a pilot programme in a number of regions to a national programme. People are still waiting for the national programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The Government must move on and also examine its commitment to cancer treatment. I accept the argument that it is not possible to provide high quality treatment for breast cancer if it is scattered over a vast number of regions. However, it is astonishing how little those who plan our medical services think of the consequences of centralising treatment for those who must travel for treatment. They appear to think that people can travel from 50, 60 or 100 miles away to the centre in Dublin. We are talking about women who are frightened, have families and might feel sick. Nobody has thought about how to permit these women to travel to Dublin in a humane, efficient and effective way, a feature of the entire programme which I find astonishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The amendment is very short on specifics. It is full of phrases like the "decision of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to ask the HSE to prepare the roll-out of the Irish cervical screening programme". No timescales or quantification have been given. According to the amendment, the House should commend the progress that has been achieved on the Government's national plan for radiation oncology services. Again, no quantification or specifics have been given. One would hope that the situation is better than it was but we need to know when it will be complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The amendment refers to the reduction in the cancer mortality rate among people under 65. What does this mean? Does it mean that people over 65 do not count? We want to see a global reduction in cancer mortality rates. This amendment appears to imply that people over 65 do not count as much as those under 65, which is extraordinary. I am sure the Minister of State's script does not address this issue but I invite him to address it and tell me why the Members on the Government's side of the House saw fit to insert a reference to a particular age group in the amendment and imply that those outside this group do not count even though the highest rate of cancer incidence is among people over 65. The motion plays with statistics and suggests an indifference to the lives of some people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming to the House. I realise that the Minister of State and his Department, along with health service personnel, are working incredibly hard to meet the challenges we face. That both he and his officials are here to discuss this important issue is most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The motion referred to five broad topics, namely, the death rates from cancer, particularly among women; cervical cancer screening; the BreastCheck programme; colorectal cancers; and regional access to cancer services. Examining each of these topics in turn reveals the Government's determination to seek out the best expert advice on the provision of cancer care in Ireland and its determination to invest heavily on the basis of this advice. This is the appropriate way for us as a society to deal with this terrible set of diseases as best we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">With regard to the first of the five issues raised by Senators Henry and O'Toole, as I stated on the last occasion when we debated this topic in the House, cancer is not a singular disease but a range of diseases. These diseases are the second most common cause of death in Ireland for both women and men. We know that the number of new cancer cases and the number of deaths from cancer have, unfortunately, steadily increased in both sexes over the past decade. In 1994, some 5,900 cases of malignant cancer were diagnosed in women. The figure is expected to reach approximately 7,400 this year. Approximately 3,500 women die from cancer each year in this country, which is testimony to the truly terrible toll this disease takes on Irish women, their families, friends and carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Although it is of little comfort, the reason for the rise in the incidence of cancer is the increasing life expectancy of and concomitant growth in the number of those aged 65 and over. I will refer to the remarks made by Senator Ryan. The amendment does not play with statistics. When one examines the statistics, one must consider the increase in the age profile and longevity of the population. The awful truth is that the risk of cancer increases with age. Research indicates that approximately one woman in seven will develop cancer by the age of 65, with the figure rising to one woman in four by the age of 75. Once adjustment has been made by population ageing, the annual death rate shows a slight decrease of approximately 0.8% each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The national cancer strategy correctly provides the expert basis for policy and investment in this area. Since 1997, €720 million has been invested in treatment and care services for people with cancer, which has made a real difference. More than 100 additional consultant posts for cancer care throughout the country have been created and, more important, the goal of a 15% decrease in the mortality rate from cancer in the under-65 age group was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target. However, we must do more. The Health Research Board states that funding of approximately €1.8 million has been made available for research into breast cancer and €0.35 million has been made available for research into prostate cancer. Awards of more than €3.5 million have been made available through the board to support this initiative in nine hospitals throughout Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The second issue relates to screening programmes. The House will be aware that comprehensive, well organised and high quality screening programmes, incorporating appropriate specialist follow-up treatments, are an effective way of reducing breast, cervical and colorectal cancer mortality rates. This is why the Government is committing more and more resources to such programmes. The Independent group motion makes specific mention of the pilot cervical screening programme, which commenced in October 2000. This is available to eligible women in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary. Cervical screening is offered free of charge to approximately 74,000 women in these counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The Tánaiste is fully committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with best international practice. The Department has requested the HSE to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national programme. Significant preparatory work is well under way in this regard. This involves the introduction of a new and improved cervical test, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. An additional €9 million has been made available to the HSE for cancer services development in 2006, including for the roll-out of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Regarding BreastCheck, this excellent national breast screening programme has been made available to women in the 50 to 64 year age group in the eastern, north-eastern, south-eastern and midlands regions. This target age group represents approximately 160,000 women in these regions. If we needed evidence of the importance of BreastCheck, one should consider the 1,600 cancers detected since the programme commenced. BreastCheck operates with a team approach and in partnership with other health care providers. Their value reaches not just those who have problems identified and who receive treatment, but those they reassure. The vast majority of women are found to be perfectly healthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">On the roll-out of the programme to the remaining regions, there are 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of the roll-out will be met. I am equally aware of the campaign in the southern area in Cork, to which Senator Ryan referred. The experts are confident that this roll-out date of 2007 will be achieved. On colorectal cancer, the National Cancer Forum provided a strategy for cancer control in Ireland in 2006 to the Tánaiste last month. This strategy will include recommendations on the criteria for decisions on the introduction of a population-based screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Government is determined to make the full range of cancer services available to cancer patients throughout Ireland. This must and will be done in line with best international practice. I commend the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, the Department, the HSE and the dedicated experts and medical practitioners on the progress we are making. I urge them to continue on this course.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_680">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. First, I want to compliment the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on the excellent decision to introduce the smoking ban. The more one travels abroad, the more one realises what a positive decision it was and how generations to come will thank their lucky stars, especially passive smokers who do not want to inhale smoke. I compliment the Government on that issue. I was in France recently and the thoughts of a pub full of smoke would deter one from going into pubs there. This decision will play a significant role in reducing the rates of cancer in the country. Perhaps we can now take matters a step further and try to encourage smokers to either cease smoking or cut down on it because there is a clear link with cancer. However, I am critical of the Government for not increasing the tax on cigarettes or alcohol in the budget, which should have happened. Given the clear link between alcohol and cigarettes, this would create an incentive to reduce the use of cigarettes and alcohol which are linked to cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I was in Blanchardstown hospital this morning for a check-up for a recurring asthma problem. I was very impressed with the facilities and the way the clinic operated. I was attended to immediately. I had X-rays taken and the level of service was fantastic. All of this was free of charge, which amazed me. One might ask what has this to do with the debate, but it proves that these clinics can work. We do not need to centralise massive hospitals as clinics such as the respiratory one to which I refer can work very effectively. While we often criticise the health service, we should also admit when it works well, as happens most of the time. Unfortunately, the media tends to focus on the negative aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">I disagree with the motion which excludes men. Men should always be included in a motion on cancer treatment. I agree with Senator Ryan who said that the Government's amendment is ambiguous. The Department of Health and Children should be directing the HSE to roll out cancer services rather than the idea of the Minister asking the HSE for a roll-out of these services. In fact, the HSE should be doing so automatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I was confused listening to Senator White because I am not sure whether she was for or against the motion. She appeared to be praising and criticising the current Minister, Deputy Harney, and criticising previous Ministers, Deputies Cowen and Martin. She appeared to be attacking the officials in the Department as if the Ministers did not have the final say. Ultimately, the Minister has the final say. Blaming officials is taking the easy option but, ultimately, responsibility and accountability lies with the Minister. It is not fair to blame anonymous civil servants when the job of the politician in charge of the Department is to make decisions. I hope this trait which may be lacking in some Ministers will change over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">When I examine the record of this and the previous Government, Senator Minihan will be pleased to hear that between the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the programme for Government——</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_688">In 1997, the full implementation of the national cancer strategy, including centres of excellence in Dublin, Cork, Galway and eight regional centres, was promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. By 2001 its full implementation had been watered-down. The Fianna Fáil manifesto stated it would implement, as a matter of urgency, cervical smear testing for GMS patients for screening as well as diagnostic purposes. It also stated programmes for breast and cervical cancer screening would be extended nationally. The national cancer strategy stated that services at local, regional and national levels would be agreed by end 2003. It also stated that a revised implementation plan would be published by end 2002. In June 2002 the agreed programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats recognised the particular need to ensure that people in all parts of the country would have reasonable access to cancer services and stated that it would ensure this objective would be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">As other speakers said, BreastCheck is not available nationwide so this idea of a national programme is a bit of a mockery. Where one lives can be a significant factor in one's treatment for cancer. Cervical screening is not available nationwide and we have not learned from the great experience in the Limerick area. Many specialists have left their posts. For example, I believe in Cork two years ago, a leading specialist left his post due to frustration with the system. I understand Senator White's criticism of the Government and perhaps of previous Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I accept Senator Minihan's point about people living longer as a result of which the rate of cancer increases. Unfortunately, cancer affects all age groups and that is why it is regrettable the Government included an age limit in its amendment to the motion. Unfortunately, we all know people who got cancer in their 20s, 30s and 40s. A relation of mine who got cancer was lucky he was able to travel from Carlow to Dublin by train each day. One might only get cancer treatment for one or two minutes per day but if one lives a distance from the hospital, must commute, feels nauseous following treatment and perhaps is incontinent, it can have a significant effect. That is why the best facilities should be available to people being treated for cancer. People should have the option of staying close to the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I helped a person in Carlow who did not have a medical card. We got him a medical card and an allowance so that he could stay in bed and breakfast accommodation close to the hospital. He was not able to afford to stay in Dublin in a hotel and he did not have any relatives in the city. Obviously, he was not in a position physically to travel to and from Carlow each day. He made a great recovery as his treatment was successful. We need to consider the rights of patients who do not have family or transport. They should be entitled to a subsidy or assistance to make their treatment less painful and more comfortable.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Much good work has been done. The smoking ban has been a great success and it will have had a major impact in 30 years time when we debate this issue. Hopefully, we will see a reduction in the incidence of cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Exercise is a key issue. Yesterday on the Order of Business, many Senators spoke about the great sporting successes last week, including the successes of the Irish rugby team, Derval O'Rourke from Cork at the World Indoor Championships and Irish racehorses at Cheltenham. I was going to point out that we have major problems in this country. As far as I know, the athlete from Cork had to get a part-time job as she was not able——</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_697">I have listened carefully to the views of Senators who have contributed to a good debate and I am pleased to have the opportunity to describe the substantial developments which have taken place in recent years in all of the main elements of a comprehensive cancer policy. Specifically, I propose to outline the substantial investment that has supported cancer services throughout the country; the progress to date on achieving the target of next year for commencement of the roll-out of BreastCheck nationally; the increased investment in the cervical screening programme and the recent decision of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to ask the HSE to prepare for national roll-out; the significant developments in oncology cytogenetic services and in laboratory and clinical genetic services for families at risk of hereditary cancer; and the unprecedented investment in radiation oncology services under the Government's national plan for radiation oncology services.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Improving cancer care is a major priority of this Government and there is broad recognition among health service providers of the significant changes that have taken place in recent years in oncology services. The key goal of the 1996 national cancer strategy was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 age group in the ten-year period from 1994. An evaluation of the 1996 national cancer strategy demonstrated that this figure was achieved in 2001, which was three years ahead of target.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">There is no doubt that cancer is a major challenge to our health services. It is a major cause of morbidity in Ireland, with 20,000 people diagnosed each year. There was little change in the number of cancer deaths between 1994 and 2001. The true risk of dying from cancer before age 75 — allowing for the effects of population change and aging — is decreasing by approximately 0.6% for women and 0.1% per year for men. Breast cancer remains the main cause of death for women but is decreasing in frequency.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Between 1991 and 1994, the five-year relative survival rate for women with all cancers was 47% in Ireland and 52% in Europe. The current five year survival rate for Ireland is 73% which is 4% below the EU average for breast cancer so we are not doing too badly but as all speakers have said, we must continue to progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Effectively, tackling the problem of cancer means providing specialist services of a consistently high quality with sufficient capacity as well as appropriate support services for patients, their carers and their families. This Government's focus is on ensuring there is access to services which deliver this experience for each person diagnosed with cancer. To this end, we have invested over €900 million in the development of cancer services since 1997. We have seen the appointment of over 100 additional consultants across the modalities of care. This investment has been reflected in the substantial increase in the level of activity, with the number of discharges from public hospitals with a diagnosis of cancer rising from 58,507 in 1998 to 92,508 in 2004 and the number of day cases in the same period increasing by 106%.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Population-based screening programmes for breast and cervical cancers have been proven to reduce mortality, with subsequent improvements in population health in terms of survival, morbidity and quality of life. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has publicly expressed her commitment to the extension of both programmes nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, is available to approximately 160,000 women in the 50 to 64 age group in the eastern, north-eastern, south-eastern and midland regions. Screening is offered free of charge to eligible women in these regions. Since the commencement of the screening programme in 2000, approximately €73 million cumulative funding has been provided to support it. Approximately 245,000 screening visits have taken place, a significant endorsement of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">There are approximately 130,000 women in the target age group in the remaining regions. The Tánaiste recently met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of her wish to have the programme rolled out nationally as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Capital funding of €21 million for the development of the necessary infrastructure has been approved. The national rollout of the programme required detailed planning for the development of essential infrastructure to provide for two clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital in Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. This detailed planning involved considerable work by BreastCheck, University College Hospital, Galway, the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork, and the Department of Health and Children. Planning permission for both units has been granted and BreastCheck is now inviting tenders for construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">BreastCheck requires highly-skilled specialists working together to ensure best outcomes for patients. A key requirement and dependency for the national rollout of the programme is the recruitment of a wide range of specialist staff. The largest single requirement in terms of staff numbers is for specially-trained radiographers who will provide screening services, both at the static centres and at mobile clinics. BreastCheck interviewed for lead consultant radiologists and radiographers in 2005 for the two new units and the recruitment of these and other key clinical staff is continuing. While the exact date of rollout will depend on the availability of adequately trained staff, BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for commencement of the national rollout will be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer will be diagnosed and treated outside of the BreastCheck programme. It is necessary, therefore, that we support both the symptomatic breast disease services and the screening services to ensure that comprehensive breast cancer services are available for all women. Breast cancer is the individual site-specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years and more than €60 million has been made available for development of symptomatic services since 2000. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred with inpatient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,386 cases in 1997 to 1,812 in 2003, an increase of over 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The Tánaiste recently requested the Health Service Executive to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national rollout of the cervical screening programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. A pilot cervical screening programme commenced in the mid-west region in 2000. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in counties Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The national rollout of the cervical screening programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications. The Tánaiste has specifically requested that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at the review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly-funded primary care services being conducted at present under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. Any remuneration arrangements agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women and payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Tánaiste is convinced that we must also have in place tailored initiatives to encourage take up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. She wishes to see the programme rolled out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services are in place that are quality assured and meet international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Outside the programme, many women present for opportunistic smear tests and the number of these tests has increased substantially in recent years. Overall, in the region of 230,000 smear tests are carried out in laboratories throughout the country each year. To meet this increased demand, additional cumulative funding of approximately €14.5 million has been provided by the Department of Health and Children since 2002 to enhance laboratory and colposcopy services. This funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel and to purchase new equipment, thereby increasing the volume of activity. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction in the waiting times for smear test results.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Additional revenue funding of €1.1 million was allocated to the programme on an ongoing basis to support the introduction of liquid-based technology in laboratories where the technology is not available and to support the development of quality assurance and training programmes. The introduction of this technology will result in fewer unsatisfactory slides that require women to return for repeat smears. It substantially improves throughput in the laboratories.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Senators referred to the failure to introduce a national colorectal screening programme. National population-based screening programmes for cancers are considered where clear evidence exists of benefit to the health of the whole population to be screened. There is evidence in some specific cancers which shows that population-based screening can improve population health in terms of survival, morbidity and quality of life. As part of the National Cancer Forum's work in preparing a new national cancer control strategy, the forum developed a framework for evidence-based decision making on the introduction of population-based screening programmes, including colorectal screening.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">In July 2005, the Tánaiste announced the Government's approval for a national network for radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011, commencing in 2008. The Department is working closely with the HSE in implementing this national plan and the Tánaiste has asked the HSE and the National Development Finance Agency, as a matter of priority, to develop and progress public private partnership arrangements to design, build, finance, maintain and partially operate the proposed services. The plan consists of four large radiation oncology centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite radiation oncology units in Limerick Regional Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital, conditional on their conforming to certain quality assurance arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Tánaiste has agreed with the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, that the new Belfast cancer centre, which is due to open this month, will treat patients from Donegal. Details of the arrangements for access for patients in Donegal to Belfast City Hospital will be developed as a matter of priority at the request of both Departments. For this purpose, an assessment of the specific radiotherapy needs of cancer patients in Donegal is being developed by the HSE at present. These developments will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology treatment throughout the country over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The National Centre for Medical Genetics is located at Our Lady's children's hospital, Crumlin, and currently runs clinics in Dublin, Cork and Galway for familial cancer. The unit has received funding in excess of €2.3 million over the past number of years to extend the oncology cytogenetic service nationwide and to provide laboratory and clinical genetics services for families at risk of hereditary cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Four cytogenetic staff were appointed in 2004 to take on the additional workload to provide a national service and since mid-2005 the centre has taken samples for oncology cytogenetic analysis from the whole country. There has been a resultant doubling in sample numbers to about 1,700 samples annually and there is now a staff of nine in the oncology cytogenetic section, headed by a principal clinical cytogeneticist.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">In 2005, the National Centre for Medical Genetics appointed five laboratory staff for the laboratory and clinical genetics services for families at risk of hereditary cancer. Two genetics counsellor posts were also filled; the first person is in place and the second is due to start this June. The additional genetic counsellor post has reduced the clinic waiting time significantly and the aim is to reduce it further by the end of 2006. Families are seen in clinics in Dublin, Cork and Galway. In 2005, the number of patients seen for clinical suspicion of hereditary cancer doubled in comparison with 2004, there was a growth of 30% in laboratory activity for molecular cancer genetics and a growth of 86% in laboratory activity for oncology cytogenetics.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">In January of this year, the National Cancer Forum submitted a new national strategy for cancer control to the Tánaiste. The forum consulted widely on the strategy during 2005 and received significant endorsement and support for its recommendations. The strategy makes recommendations on organisation, governance, quality assurance and accreditation across the continuum of cancer care from prevention and health promotion through ten treatment services, palliative care and research. There is a strong emphasis in the strategy on health promotion, addressing inequalities and quality assurance. It is a policy document which aims to take Ireland up the international league table in terms of cancer control. The Tánaiste is examining this strategy prior to bringing it to Government and it will be published shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The developments in cancer services I have outlined are a clear indication of the considerable progress which has been made in addressing the burden of cancer. These developments reflect the priority given to cancer care by the Government. It is, therefore, appropriate that the House should commend the Government on its positive and demonstrable commitment to cancer services, especially cancer affecting women.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_721">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Independent group for tabling this motion. It is important to be proactive rather than reactive in the debate on health services. It becomes clear that this is a live debate when one speaks to those directly or indirectly affected by cancer. Unfortunately, whether through family, friends or the local community, Senators will all know people who have experienced the ordeal of cancer or are undergoing cancer therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I seek clarification on an issue I have raised previously. I am pleased to note a slight change in the language used in respect of cancer, radiation and oncology treatment for patients from County Donegal. Cancer patients in my county have had to endure the long trek to Dublin for cancer care. Options will, however, become available in Galway. A recent announcement that it may be possible to treat cancer patients from County Donegal in Belfast was met with confusion and derision. I intend no disrespect to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children or her counterpart in Northern Ireland but this response was justified shortly afterwards when Mr. Shaun Woodward MP, the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland, stated on a radio programme in County Donegal that cancer patients from County Donegal would be treated in Belfast provided beds were available. This was a legitimate point and it was clearly based on demographic factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">It is planned to establish four major radiation oncology units in the South, two in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork, as well as two outreach satellite centres, one in Limerick and one in Waterford. Six major centres will, therefore, cater for a population of 3.5 million. Viewed from a geographical perspective, service provision will follow an arc stretching from Galway in the west, south to Limerick, Cork and Waterford and north into Dublin. These units will cater for those living in the region extending from north County Louth southwards around the coast as far as south County Sligo. The people of the midlands will also have access to these services. When one subtracts from the population of the Twenty-six Counties the population of counties Donegal and Leitrim and north county Sligo — approximately 400,000 — one finds that the proposed plan will cater for 3.1 million people. The population of Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is more than 1.5 million. The reason Mr. Shaun Woodward MP made his remarks is that the new Belfast radiation oncology unit will cater for 1.5 million people and they will be given priority in terms of access to services. In contrast, we are establishing six centres to cater for a population of slightly more than 3 million. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that these figures present a mathematical and numerical anomaly. The reason Mr. Woodward stated that County Donegal patients would be accommodated in Belfast provided beds were available was because he looked at the mathematics.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Not alone are people from north County Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim examining the complexities of the system, so too are the people of counties Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry. This is the reason we must have ongoing cross-Border interaction and communication between Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry and Letterkenny General Hospital in County Donegal. While I am aware that negotiations and communications between the joint management teams at both hospitals are ongoing, we have not received much detail on progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">In terms of service provision, the people of the north west have been overlooked and find themselves facing a dangerous anomaly. People in the North who live west of the River Bann, an area which includes much of counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry, have long held that central government in London has neglected them. The proposed provision of cancer services in the South is an example of the same type of neglect being shown to the people of the north west who have long believed they have been abandoned by central government in Dublin. Cancer service provision is the proof in the pudding. Peripherality and distance have been blamed but the truth is the north-western regions have been neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Why did the Scottish and Welsh want devolved government? The reason was that the centralisation of power does not work either in our democracy or in the United Kingdom. We must address the failure of central government in London and Dublin to meet the needs of the people of the north west and the forum for doing so is at joint ministerial level. We can talk about the Good Friday Agreement until the cows come home but we must start to act on it. We have cross-Border opportunities to accommodate and facilitate those whom we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The geographical arc between Galway and Dublin which I described extends beyond health into such areas as transport, industry and infrastructure. We have failed to provide infrastructural investment or adequate health services to the people of the north west.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">How can the radiation unit in Belfast accommodate cancer patients from County Donegal when it already covers a population of 1.5 million people? The figures do not add up. The north west was previously mentioned as a potential satellite centre and I want to know why reference was not made to that today.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_731">I thank the Minister of State for attending this House and I was interested to hear his contribution on this motion. For seven years, I was a member of the Western Health Board, which campaigned to make BreastCheck available in the west of Ireland. Senator Cox, who chaired the board in its last year, promoted this campaign and organised a petition which received thousands of signatures. The Minister of State clearly stated that BreastCheck is available to approximately 160,000 women in the 50 to 64 age group in the east, north east, south east and midlands. He went on to say that it will be introduced to Galway and the west in 2007 but we expected that it would be available by now. I hope that the 2007 target is met because we have fought for the service for a long time. The HSE is continuing that fight and it is significant that tenders for construction are being invited.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">I concur with the remarks made by other speakers on the success of screening programmes in Scandinavian countries and in our neighbour, Great Britain. When we held a debate on male cancer, it was noted that men do not visit doctors as often as they should but that is not true in the case of women. The problem in the west of Ireland is that the facilities are not available. Cancer is not a death sentence but people worry about family histories. The Minister of State offered hope in his remarks on cervical screening, BreastCheck and the Tánaiste's plan for a national cancer strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Senator O'Toole asked whether we are prepared for an outbreak of avian flu. There was a significant mobilisation of forces when foot and mouth disease threatened this country and it is welcome that the person responsible for that, Professor Michael Monaghan, is chairman of the avian influenza advisory group. However, the threat of cancer hangs over the many people who do not have opportunities to avail of screening. Such opportunities must be provided and the sooner that is done through the national cancer strategy, the better.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_734">I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion. While I will support the amendment, I am grateful to Senator Henry for putting this issue on the agenda for debate. I commend the Government, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State on all they are doing. That is not to deny, however, that much more needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I concur with much of what was said by Senator McHugh. We are behind schedule on BreastCheck and it was a mistake to roll it out in one area at a time rather than everywhere. We should not make the same mistake with cervical cancer screening, which must be available everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Along with my colleagues from the north, I take credit for the fact that the Galway centre for BreastCheck is nearing completion. I would like pressure to be exerted to ensure it is rolled out as quickly as possible. The Tánaiste gave an undertaking that the service will be available by 2007 and hinted that it may be ready by the end of this year. I hope this is so because the life of a woman in Dublin is no more important than that of someone in Sligo or Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">We should scrap the idea of pilot areas and start thinking about the problem as a whole. A pilot screening programme for cervical cancer was introduced in the midlands and international statistics show great benefits from such programmes. However, the programme should be made available nationally without delay because everybody must be included. Money should be no object when it comes to people's lives and health.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I have consistently raised the lack of the infrastructure north of a line from Dublin to Galway and west of Mullingar, and radiotherapy is no different. Under the Hollywood proposals, two centres will be provided in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork, which is fantastic. Due to political pressure, agreement has been reached on satellite units for Limerick and Waterford. Again, however, nothing has been provided north of the line between Dublin and Galway and west of Mullingar. People are advised to go to Belfast but that is unrealistic because people want centres for treatment rather than for diagnosis. As it is not reasonable for a mother of young children who suffers from breast cancer to travel to St. Luke's for radiotherapy, we want the service to be brought closer to home. It is a delusion to think it is easier to travel to Belfast or Galway than to Dublin. We require radiotherapy services in Sligo. That means one linear accelerator at an approximate cost of €3 million to €6 million in capital expenditure. I am aware that is a significant amount and that running the service will require even more but there is no excuse. My colleagues, Deputy Devins and Senators Feeney and Scanlon, are most anxious about this issue. We demand a linear accelerator for Sligo which will service the north west.</p>

If I ask him to include a national population register in the Bill and tell him that it will help him keep track of people in the country more easily, he may do it.</p>

It is dreadful to ask Irish women to congratulate the Government on the fact that the survival rate at five years for breast and cervical cancer is only 4% below the EU average. The Minister of State cannot do it. We know the only countries lower than us are Estonia, Slovakia, Poland and Scotland. We cannot ask Irish women not to query why they should not be up with Finland, Sweden, France, Italy and Germany.</p>

We cannot accept that opportunistic screening is apparently to suffice for the moment all over the country, while we sort out general practitioners. We know this is not even free to those women with medical cards. The Minister of State could tell me that his Department will provide opportunistic cervical cancer screening free to every woman with a medical card. A doctor-only medical card would suffice in this case. I would accept such a proposal for the moment, as it would show that something is being done. It is women in poor socioeconomic conditions who are most affected by these conditions. The Minister of State could enforce such a provision immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">There is another important factor in the increase of breast and colorectal cancers in this country, obesity. Since the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil have entered Government, the obesity rate in the population has increased from 9% in 1997 to 18% now. That is another factor which will increase the incidence of cancer in this country. It is fine to state that there has been a doubling of the number of people getting genetic screening since 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">This doubling has come from a figure close to zero. This will not do. The Health Research Board is of course doing tremendous work in cancer research, but the population is not getting the benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Senator Browne mentioned that two oncologists left Cork and went to Dublin due to lack of facilities and backup. I had great trouble in persuading an oncologist in another centre, which I will not mention, to stay here. He told me he had no beds despite being back two years from America. He stated he was going to return to America because he was so sickened by the matter, although I persuaded him to stay. We have good people here and we should have a much better service.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The Government is not taking this issue seriously enough. Senator O'Toole was correct in stating that if we heard that 640 people would die from avian flu next year, there would be chaos. The same number of women will die from breast cancer. Thousands are cured of breast cancer in this country, and the disease is curable now. We must increase the numbers of people in this country who are cured of cancer, and not congratulate ourselves for the little bits and pieces we are doing here and there.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_813">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Seamus Brennan, for coming to the House to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I wish to put on record not only my deep appreciation but that of Irish communities, with whom I am in regular contact in the UK and the United States, for the commitment the Minister has shown to the Irish diaspora since he was given this important brief. I received an e-mail today from Mr. Kieran O'Sullivan, who is a leading activist in the Boston Irish community, extolling the virtues of the Minister following his recent visit to Boston. When I told him I was raising an issue concerning the Irish in Britain he asked me to pass on to the Minister the good wishes of the Irish community in Boston and to thank him for the work he is doing. Ministers are criticised on occasion and Members on all sides of both Houses were unfairly criticised recently for travelling abroad to represent their country on St. Patrick's Day so it is important to put on record the appreciation of the Irish community for the work he is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">I will not go into details because I have already established dialogue with the Minister on the issue. It is important, however, to emphasise the importance attached by the Irish community in Britain to the extension of free travel to Irish pensioners living there. As the Minister will be aware from his frequent visits to the United Kingdom, free travel, alongside the transmission of RTE television programmes, is the main issue that arises on a regular basis at any gathering of Irish community activists throughout the United Kingdom and was on the agenda of the Federation of Irish Societies at its annual congress last summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I am fully aware of the difficulties the Minister has faced in trying to resolve this issue, not only in terms of the financial commitments the Government would need to embark upon but also our Treaty of Rome obligations. It would be difficult to single out a section of people in another member state of the EU purely on grounds of their nationality without extending the benefit across the Union. However, the Minister has been making significant progress in this area over the past 12 months. Notably, he established a dialogue with his opposite number in Northern Ireland under the direct rule Administration and, according to media reports and the excellent press service of his Department, there is an indication that the Minister is close to reaching an agreement on extending the existing free travel arrangements enjoyed by pensioners living in the Republic of Ireland to those living on the entire island. If that is the case, I am sure the Minister will agree that it opens the door, albeit to a small degree, to extend a similar benefit to Irish pensioners living elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">It is on this core issue that I want the Minister to address this Adjournment matter. It has been suggested that the Minister's legal advisers have indicated that the Minister may be able to add free travel as a benefit to existing benefits enjoyed by pensioners without contravening our Treaty of Rome obligations. Will the Minister inform the House on current developments in the extension of free travel to Irish citizens in the United Kingdom and take one of the issues exercising the minds of the Irish diaspora therein off the agenda?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_320">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_818">I will open with a formal reply but wish to add a personal comment at the end. The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance receive a free travel pass regardless of their age. It is also available to people aged under 66 years who are in receipt of certain disability-type welfare payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who have been in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment for at least 12 months from a country covered by EU regulations or with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement are also eligible for free travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath, Iarnród Éireann, Luas and more than 80 private transport operators. The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point-to-point cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. In line with the Government's objective to put in place an all-Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of the island, I am committed to significantly improving the North-South element of the current arrangements and hope to be in a position to make an announcement about this soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">There have been a number of requests and inquiries on the extension of the entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland or those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit. The legal advice available to me is that such proposals would be contrary to the EC treaty, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. However, I am continuing to explore all aspects of a possible approach. Recognition of the contribution of emigrants to the growth of this country is a priority of the Government and access for them to free travel arrangements here would be one such gesture of recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I acknowledge the number of times Senator Mooney has formally and informally raised this matter with me in his role as a representative. He has brought to my attention how important this matter is for Irish emigrants, particularly those in the UK with whom he is very close. The Senator is right in that we have almost reached a conclusion on the Northern Ireland issue, that is, to allow citizens in the Republic to travel around the North for free and <i>vice versa</i>. We are within weeks of pinning it down. It will be a significant step forward as it will give us an all-Ireland travel zone.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The east-west issue, particularly in respect of the UK, is not a financial matter in my view, rather a legal one. It is manageable from a financial point of view. It is the Government's policy to do this, as we wish to extend to our emigrants in the UK the right of free travel here. In an ideal world it would be possible to extend this provision to all Irish citizens in Britain but, realistically, that would be difficult, as one would need to extend it to all citizens of the European Union over 66 years of age. However, 31,000 people living in the UK are paid contributory pensions directly by my Department. While the advice from the Attorney General's office is that such provision would not be possible, I am continuing to explore whether we can attach a condition to pensions here which would also attach to pensions wherever the people in question reside to allow this.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I have not given up on this issue. Senator Mooney and others have impressed on me the importance of this matter many times. I am determined to pursue the legal difficulties to determine whether I can find a solution. We owe so much to our emigrants that we should try to do this for them.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_825">I am raising the issue of the need for the Department of Social and Family Affairs to put in place procedures to speed up the processing of forms for agents who collect social welfare payments on behalf of claimants who are unable to cash their payable order books due to illness or loss of mobility. Would the Minister consider providing special priority envelopes for such applications as I have suggested?</p>
          <p eId="para_826">A number of constituents have contacted me about problems collecting their pensions due to illness. They applied to the Department of Social and Family Affairs to get permission for an agent to collect their pension books on their behalf but there has been a delay. For example, a person telephoned me and explained why he did not receive his pension. When the person rang the Department's offices in Sligo, he was initially told that the book could not be located. Later, he was told that it would be returned to the local post office and, in the meantime, the person should go to the community welfare office to get a payment. This was not appropriate as the person in question is not mobile and being asked to go to the community welfare officer is not realistic. The person should not have been put in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">In a similar situation an elderly lady wanted to get permission for her home help to collect her pension on her behalf but, when she wrote to the Department's offices in Sligo, there was a delay in processing the application. She was told that she should go to the community welfare officer and get a payment in the meantime, which would not be practical for many reasons. Moreover, many people would not like to do that, as they believe that it should only be done as a last resort. When the two elderly people in question telephoned the Department, they were left hanging on the line for a long time. I am not blaming the Department as many calls are received by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">For people who want to apply for an agent to collect their pensions on their behalf, would the Minister consider providing a special envelope that they could send to the Department? They could then give it priority and deal with it immediately. This concerns elderly people, pensioners living on a low income who may live on their own, and this suggestion is one way the matter could be dealt with by the Department.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_829">I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter. My Department administers a wide range of income support schemes and these payments are made to claimants either on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis depending on the nature of the payment. Payments for long-term schemes, including certain illness and disability schemes, are generally made by a book of payable orders which are cashed at post offices. Alternatively, payments may be made directly into a claimant's bank or building society account or, in certain instances, by cheque.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">In the vast majority of cases payments are made directly to the person who is entitled to that payment. However, there are circumstances under social welfare legislation, where payment may be made directly to persons other than the claimant with the agreement of the claimant and my Department. Such persons are appointed to act as agents to collect payments on behalf of a claimant. Generally agents are appointed where a person is unable to cash the payment due to frailty, incapacity or loss of mobility. They may also be appointed in cases where a person is permanently unable to act for themselves or to discharge responsibility. In many cases parents, guardians or other family members are appointed as agents.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">My Department has formalised service level agreements with 112 residential or other service providers for the management of moneys relating to the disability allowance payment. Some 81,000 persons have been appointed to act as agents or on behalf of social welfare recipients for the purposes of long-term disability schemes and old age or widow's pensions. These agents have been appointed to collect social welfare payments for approximately 40,000 persons in receipt of old age, retirement or widow's payments, some 10,400 persons in receipt of invalidity pension and some 28,600 persons in receipt of disability allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">My Department is committed to providing a quality service to aid its customers. This includes ensuring that applications for appointment of agents are processed as expeditiously as possible having regard to the necessary safeguards and conditions that apply. In all cases where a person applies to become an agent a written application is required, with the consent of the social welfare claimant where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The agent is appointed by my Department on the understanding that the social welfare payment due will be spent for the benefit of the person concerned. While every effort is made to offer an efficient service this must be balanced by the need to ensure that social welfare entitlements and payments are appropriately managed. An agency arrangement may be withdrawn at any time by my Department where it has reason to believe that the social welfare payment is not being used for the benefit of the claimant.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">In normal circumstances, where the necessary application and supporting documentation have been provided, agents are appointed for the purposes of collecting payments within a period of three days to a week. In instances where a person is permanently unable to act for himself or herself, the case is issued to a social welfare inspector for completion of the appropriate documentation and verification of the agency arrangement. There are unavoidable time lags in determining such cases as the necessary investigations and inquiries must first be completed. However, these cases only represent 9% of the total number of agents appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I appreciate Senator Tuffy raising this matter, I have listened to her carefully and I note her request that the Department provide special priority envelopes for such applications. This will be examined.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_836">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He is aware I have embarked on a new policy document on a new approach to ageing and ageism. Housing for older people is a major aspect of how we look after older people in the future. My research and work on the ground shows frustration at the lack of choice of housing for older people. The vast majority of older people wish to live in their homes independently and with dignity for as long as possible. The overwhelming majority of older people have a fear of entering long-stay residential care. Does the Minister of State agree? None of us would like to live in such care.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Older people who require hospital care are categorised as "delayed discharge" patients because the care they require after being discharged is not available in their own community. Some will not apply for subvention and others with subvention do not have sufficient funds for long-stay care. They do not wish to sell their home and their families do not have money to fund long-stay care. My research suggests the crux of the matter is the lack of housing and care options for older people. There has been a remarkable growth in institutional long-term care. Half of the €1 billion allocated to the elderly is spent on 5% of residential home care costs. The Government policy from 1988 entitled The Years Ahead, recommended that people be looked after as much as possible in their homes or communities. This policy has not been implemented because of tax incentives for residential homes. I am not opposed to tax incentives but half of the €1 billion is spent on residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">A report entitled The Housing Needs of Older People by Dr. David Stratton of Age Action Ireland, found that older people considered institutional long-term care the only option because they lacked the support needed to make informed choices about future accommodation. In any event, their choices are limited due to the lack of forward planning by the Government. The Government has not delivered the policy it decided on in 1988. This is the reason there is so much congestion in Dublin hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The Minister of State is well-informed about St. Brendan's high-support unit in Mulrany, County Mayo. This was set up by Dr. Jerry Cowley, a Deputy in the other House. Older people who need medical help can continue to live locally with all the care and support required provided by visiting professionals. The older people can continue to live independently and with dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Despite the policy document of 1988, the Government's aim of keeping people in their homes for as long as possible, and the wish of the majority of older people to remain at home as long as possible, the reality is that investment has been directed to long-stay care facilities, leaving many older people with no choice but long-stay care. Many cannot bear this choice and I would hate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">I call on the Government to publish a new strategy for older people, reflecting the wishes of older people and offering them a real choice. Government resources should be directed accordingly in an equitable way rather than claiming there is insufficient funds to pay for this housing. The Government needs a policy to provide a halfway house between residential home care and remaining in one's home. Every county development plan should designate space and finances for sheltered housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Those for whom it is no longer acceptable that they stay at home, who may need medical help two or three times a day, would be better off in sheltered housing, not in residential home care. I do not want to criticise all residential homes but in any I have visited I have seen the older people sitting passively, looking at the television. On this I also speak to those in the Visitors Gallery——</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_844">We need a middle ground. If older people are not able to cope at home, live alone, need medical help and do not wish to go into residential care, they should live in middle-ground sheltered housing. The Government needs a policy on sheltered and support housing. I do not blame the Minister. He must not take this personally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_845">I thank Senator White for raising this matter and for the interest she has shown in older people and services for them. The latest figures supplied to the Department by the Health Service Executive on delayed discharges in the Dublin area teaching hospitals indicate that on 14 March 2006, 398 people were categorised as delayed discharges. The number of older people in this category was 349. Of the 349 older people, 68 refuse to apply for subvention for long-term care and 60 are assessed as ineligible for subvention for long-term care. A further 65 applications are being considered by the HSE. However, a number of persons could refuse to complete the application process or may be ineligible once assessed, and therefore the number refusing to apply or ineligible may be significantly greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home care and it was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs of private nursing home care. The number of older people who are granted subvention and who would still not have sufficient funds to pay for long-term care is not quantifiable because the actual nursing home selection and fee is agreed between the patient and the individual nursing homes. The HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention, currently €190.50 per week, in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of the scheme in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006, which is being published today, will ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and will help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. It should be noted that an additional €20 million funding has been allocated in the budget 2006 to the nursing home subvention scheme for residents of private nursing homes. This represents an increase of 14% over 2005, which has an estimated spend of €140 million. In addition, €8 million has also been provided to cover the cost of 250 extra nursing home beds which the HSE has sourced from private nursing homes. The HSE is also in the process of acquiring a further 250 extra beds from private nursing homes to accommodate older people requiring nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">An interdepartmental working group was established by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Seamus Brennan, to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. This group has now reported and its report is currently being considered by the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I draw the Senator's attention to the commitment that this Government has shown to older people's care issues and point to budget 2006, which allocated additional resources of €150 million to services for older people and palliative care, €110 million in 2006 and a further €40 million for 2007. The investment package is focused on caring for people at home, in accordance with their expressed wishes. It is a major step in focussing new resources on home care first and foremost, while still supporting appropriate residential care. This is in line with international trends and also reflects the growing independence of older people who want to stay living in their communities for as long as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters of the full year costs, or €109 million of the €150 million, are committed to community care supports. This investment is a response by the Government to older people's preference to be cared for at home rather than going into residential care. Often older people require some additional home help or more developed home support, including various therapy services. All the evidence shows that families caring for elderly relatives continue to provide care in partnership with the support services put in place for those that require it. It is estimated that 28% of nursing home residents have a low to moderate dependency level and many of these residents might have continued to live at home if the right supports had been made available to them at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Home care packages deliver a wide range of services and have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years. They include the services of nurses, home care attendants, home helps and the various therapists including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. A home care package will vary according to the care needs of the individual. The home care packages will also be available to those older people who have been admitted to long-term care and who now wish to return to the community. In addition, the packages will be offered to people who are already using existing core services, such as home helps, but need more assistance to continue to live in their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">The packages are delivered through the HSE by a range of providers including the HSE, voluntary groups and the private sector. The scheme will be as flexible as possible and highly responsive to the real needs of the individual. Some 1,100 home care packages were in place at the end of 2005 and by the end of 2006 a further total of 2,000 additional home care packages will have been provided which will amount to a trebling of the current service provision. The priority for home care packages will be older people who are inpatients in acute hospitals or those who are living in the community who might otherwise have to avail of long-term care. Additional investment has also been made in the many other areas of community support including home help, day and respite centres, meals on wheels and sheltered housing. Again I thank the Senator and I hope I have clarified some of the issues she raised</p>
