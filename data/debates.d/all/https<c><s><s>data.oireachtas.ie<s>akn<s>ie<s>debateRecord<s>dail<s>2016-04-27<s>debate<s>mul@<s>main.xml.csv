The proceedings in relation to No. 4a shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 2.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil Party, Sinn Féin, the AAA-PBP, Independents 4 Change, the Social Democrats, the Green Party, or a Member nominated in their stead, and a non-party Deputy, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and such Members may share their time; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and such Members may share their time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes. The proceedings in relation to No. 4b shall, if not previously concluded, adjourn at 6.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, Sinn Féin, the AAA-PBP, Independents 4 Change, the Social Democrats, the Green Party, or a Member nominated in their stead, and a non-party Deputy, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and such Members may share their time; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and such Members may share their time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. The Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until tomorrow at 10.30 a.m., when there shall be no Order of Business within the meaning of Standing Order 28. Accordingly, the only business to be transacted shall be, by order, agreed on that day.

However, I wish to make a point about how we do business in this Parliament. We got this document last night, with a minimal amount of time to read and assess it, and I do not believe that is in the nature of the discussions we are having in the Sub-Committee on Dáil Reform. We need to start changing the way we do business now. We should have received this document several days ago and have had time to conduct detailed research before speaking on it. I welcome the debate, but we need to start changing the way we do business, particularly in regard to finance issues and how we consider budgets. We must give them time here so that we can make a proper contribution.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	3	After eight weeks and five days - almost nine weeks - it would appear that the popular will of the people has finally broken through and forced Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil at least towards the idea that the will of the people should be respected and that this House should honour its democratic mandate on the issue of water charges.

We believe we should now go the next step and allow that decision to be made by taking motions today. A motion has been put down by 39 Members on the issue. We do not need a commission or more dithering or delay. If, finally, the principle that the democratic mandate that is operating on this House in regard to water charges is to be respected, we should take the next logical step and allow a vote to take place on this issue to finally put it to bed. People are fed up after eight weeks. They want to move on to other issues.

It would have been reasonable to swap what is proposed for tomorrow's business to proposed now in regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, because we cannot seriously expect Deputies to come into the Chamber and properly debate a major piece of work and present opinions in an informative manner rather than off the top of their heads. That is not going to happen in this space of time. Spokespersons and Deputies have not had enough time to examine the material presented to them last night and some people did not even get it until now. It is a major job to consider it. I propose that we swap the statements on the EU migrants and refugees planned for tomorrow with the statements on the stability programme. This would be reasonable and would give people time to digest what is in the documentation that was circulated at 10 p.m. last night.

This matters. It sets parameters for the budget, is based on the growth forecast and comes from the Commission. This is the first part in a very important part of the budgetary process. We got it at 10 p.m. last night. We telephoned the Minister's office yesterday, as soon as we knew statements were coming, but the officials refused to speak to us. We telephoned the Department of Finance and it refused to speak to us. This is a very pretty document in that it has had graphic designers, typesetters and printers, which means the data in the document has been available for a considerable period of time. It is completely unacceptable that graphic designers, typesetters, printers and civil servants have all had access to this document, which is a key part of the budgetary process, and that the caretaker Minister, the acting Minister, would put it in pigeonholes for Parliament to consider at 10 p.m. at night and say we can have a chat about it in the morning and he will then send it off to the European Commission.

I did not get it in my pigeonhole last night. Up to 9.30 p.m. I had not got it. I make the same point as others. This is such an important document and the issues are so important, but we have not had enough time to deal with it now. It is incumbent on us to have read it in order to be able to come into the House and make statements on it. As Independent Members, it is hard enough for us to get enough time to debate all the issues and it is important that we know the issues. It is important we are fully aware of what is in this document and of the important decisions therein. I agree the debate on this should be delayed.

It is good that we are talking about the economy this morning. Deputy Ryan asked for a debate on this issue a number of weeks ago and note was taken of that by the Whip. In respect of Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I received and read his letter and thank him for sending it to me.  I would point out to Deputies Donnelly and McGrath that this paper was presented to the Cabinet yesterday by the Minister for Finance. It is strictly a technical and statistical paper. There is no policy change involved here. This paper would normally be sent to Brussels, without debate in the House. Yesterday, the Cabinet felt that in accordance with the current situation and the changed circumstances, it was important for the Members of the Oireachtas to see this paper, which is purely statistical and technical and has no policy change, before it is sent to Brussels on Friday.  Furthermore, I make the point that the discussions that are taking place between my party and Fianna Fáil have not yet concluded. Therefore, we are not in a position to sign off on a deal or agreement that would have to be looked at by the Independent Members in order to form a government.

This paper is merely technical and statistical. There is no policy change here. A debate of some length would be required if policy changes were involved. Normally, this paper went to Brussels without any discussion here. However, yesterday when it was cleared by Cabinet, we felt it should be presented as a result of the request made by Deputy Ryan a number of weeks ago.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	39	Not agreed. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have colluded since the start of this Dáil to prevent us from discussing water charges and Irish Water. Now that they have what seems to be the outline of a deal between them, behind closed doors, they are happy for us to discuss it but not to make any decision about it. It is simply not good enough. The outline of the deal about which we have heard reflects the mass movement of protest and the reality that people are refusing to pay, which can be seen in the concession in the form of the mooted suspension of charges. We have seen a row-back by Fianna Fáil on its election manifesto commitment to end water charges and abolish Irish Water and an attempt to kick the can down the road by establishing a commission, the purpose of which will be to save water charges and the Irish Water project. People have now spoken very clearly in three ways. They have spoken clearly in demonstrations on the streets involving over 100,000 people; they have spoke clearly through a boycott - the figure is undoubtedly over 50% and it is being suppressed by Irish Water; and they have spoken clearly in the general election, with the consequence that in this Dáil there is a majority of Deputies who have a mandate to end water charges and abolish Irish Water. It is not good enough that we will have discussions today without making decisions. We should allow motions to be taken today and we should vote on those motions because Irish Water and water charges could effectively be put out of their misery politically today rather than revived at a later stage. For that reason, we do not agree with the Order of Business. We ask that the motions be taken today.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	40	Eight weeks and four days on, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have agreed to allow statements this afternoon, without a vote, on the issue of water charges. That is not good enough. Fianna Fáil in its manifesto clearly called for the abolition of Irish Water and the scrapping of water charges and that is the mandate to which it should be true. The Dáil should be allowed to vote on the motion before it which has been tabled by 39 Deputies. It reflects the mandate of the majority of Deputies in this Chamber, but we are being denied that right because it appears that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have concocted a fudge to push the issue up the road in order that Fianna Fáil can support Deputy Enda Kenny being returned as Taoiseach. If we dealt with the water charges issue today and voted on it, we might lose it, which would be fair enough, but if everybody was true to his or her mandate, we would win it and the issue would then be done and dusted. The two parties could then go back and deal with the other issues without having this one bearing down on people in perpetuity. I appeal to the two parties which have blocked any meaningful debate on this issue since we returned and make the case which I have made consistently that this Chamber is an independent legislator. It is not an arm of government or Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The Taoiseach and Deputy Micheál Martin should do the decent thing and let the Dáil debate and vote on the issue, something we are entitled and which we are mandated to do.

From the outset of this Dáil, it was pointed out by the Chair and the Ceann Comhairle's office that independent motions belonging to different parties and groupings were matters to be discussed in Private Members' time. We are in limbo in that a Government has not been formed. It is not accurate to say any party prevented anybody from tabling a motion. The current Standing Orders did so and we did not collude in any way, shape or form to prevent it from happening. Motions on their own will not end water charges. It will take legislation and the formation of a Government to have an authoritative process to end water charges and deal with the utility issue, if that is the desire of Dáil Éireann. Everybody banding together to pass motions will not bring that about; that is the reality. Unlike others in this House, we have worked to give practical and real effect to the issues debated in the election. We have not stood back for the past two months, as others have done, in sitting on their hands and making no effort to change anything on this issue. I heard Deputy Eoin Ó Broin on RTE, with the verbal dexterity that is his wont, explain again Sinn Féin's U-turn after U-turn on this issue in the past 12 months, whether it relates to paying or not paying the charges, or whether it is or is not in favour of a utility and so on. I look forward to the debate today.

As a Deputy who stood in this and the last election in opposition to water charges, who has not paid them and who has stood against metering in communities because people believe it is the next step to privatisation, it is important that the democratic will of the people be discussed today. That is the problem with the statements we have heard in the past few days. We discussed very important issues but with nothing at the end of them. Yesterday we discussed the important issue of mental health services, but nothing came of them, other than the Minister for Health making a statement, with which I did not agree. The caretaker Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, said on radio this morning that his party did not win the election and indeed it did not.

There are ongoing discussions between the two largest parties in the Dáil, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, with a view to putting in place the parameters of an agreement that would allow for a Government to be formed, on which there would need to be consultation with Independent Members. Motions will not impact and change legislation, as is necessary, if it is the desire of the House to do what is intended. I disagree with what Deputy Gerry Adams said. Some of the debates that have taken place here have brought forward important views from Members of the House on Brexit, mental health and the health of the agri-sector. Deputy Gerry Adams knows that it is perfectly in order for him to discuss his motion in Private Members' time. Motions voted on have no impact on legislation that may or may not be required.

It relates to what has become a litany of so-called gangland killings, three of which have happened in my constituency, others across the city. Everybody would agree that we now have not just a crisis in policing resources, but also a crisis in community confidence. This is an issue that needs to be discussed, debated, resolved and decided upon on the floor of the Dáil. I understand that the motion that I lodged with the Ceann Comhairle has been ruled out of order. That is as he says it. However, I wish to register for the record, not least on behalf of the people whom I represent, that they had and have an expectation that we take an interest in what is happening in the real world and on the streets and the circumstances of fear and vulnerability in which they are now living. The Garda Síochána in the city of Dublin, north and south of the River Liffey, is down 100 uniformed gardaí. The gardaí themselves have met in conference, as the Ceann Comhairle knows. They have set out again very starkly the circumstances that they are in, and it is not acceptable that all of that is happening, with all of the impact on community and families, and not a word said about it in the Dáil Chamber.

In terms of process, we have a legal obligation to submit a stability programme to Brussels by the end of April. All member states are required to do this, unless they are in a programme. Thankfully, the days when we were in a programme are over for Ireland. The stability programme sets out the Government's macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for Ireland and is the first update of the Government's projections since budget 2016 in October of last year. The SPU is presented in draft form and I am, as usual, willing to take on board useful comments made by Deputies. The final version will be submitted to Brussels tomorrow, or at the latest on Friday. The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the stability programme have already been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. That is the process. The Department of Finance generates the statistics, they are submitted to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and, when it agrees, the documents are prepared for submission to the European Commission. As part of the annual European semester process, the European Commission assesses the budgetary strategy of each member state by reference to its stability programme. On this occasion it is important to note that the economic and fiscal forecasts contained in this document are prepared on a technical, no-policy-change basis. We are not setting out any new policies within this document. This is the standard practice where there is a political interregnum. This document makes no reference to fiscal space. This can be set out in a Spring Economic Statement or summer statement at a later stage. The Spring Economic Statement, which an incoming Government should be in a position to generate in the first half of May, will be the subject of a major debate in this House and will contain policy proposals in the normal way. At the time of the budget last year, my Department estimated a net fiscal space of €8.5 billion over the period 2017 to 2021. The Department of Finance also clarified that if the medium-term objective, MTO, was changed, it would free up an additional €1.5 billion of fiscal space over this timeline. The MTO has subsequently been changed. In addition, some other inputs have changed. On foot of these changes, my Department currently estimates the net fiscal space to be somewhere in the region of €10 billion to €11 billion over the period 2017 to 2021. For next year, again arising from some changes into the inputs of calculation, the net fiscal space is estimated at around €900 million. I stress that this is work in progress and subject to revision. There are many moving parts in the calculation, including inputs from the European Commission that only become available over the summer, and this may give rise to further variations in the figure before budget day.The House will recall that the figures last year varied considerably between the spring statement and budget day. The likelihood is that any variation of the €900 million figure will be an upward variation rather than a downward variation. This is not absolutely certain at this point because, as I have said, there is a number of moving parts and we are dependent on the European Commission for some of the data on which these calculations are made and that data will not be available until some time in the summer. Turning to the economic situation, I am greatly encouraged by the data flow over the past year or so showing that the recovery is gaining momentum with the economy growing at the fastest rate in Europe, with growth of 7.8% recorded in 2015. The expansion in economic activity, initially led by the exporting sectors, has broadened with growth now increasingly driven by domestic factors allowing households and businesses plan for the future with a renewed sense of optimism. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs rich and tax rich. Central to this progress has been the restoration of Irish competitiveness which is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth. The latest data show GDP increased by 9.2% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of last year. This comes on the back of a similar increase of 7.2% in the third quarter. These are strong figures and tally with what I see on the ground; people, especially those working in the private sector, have more money in their pockets, consumer confidence is recovering and businesses are expanding. The job now is to broaden the recovery so that every individual in all parts of the country benefits from the better situation. My Department is forecasting GDP growth of 4.9% this year and 3.9% next year, likely to put us at the top of the European league table once again. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021, the economy has the capacity to grow by 3% to 3.25% per annum with positive contributions from both exports and domestic demand. These forecasts have been marked upwards since the forecast presented here on budget day in October last and they are in line with Central Bank forecasts, ESRI forecasts and some forecasts generated by the private sector. As a matter of fact, we are slightly adrift of the Central Bank forecast which predicted 5.1% for this year. The economic recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market in which we have now had 13 successive quarters of employment growth. Approximately 140,000 jobs have been created since the launch of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative in early 2012. Encouragingly, employment is set to exceed the 2 million mark this year for the first time since early 2009. In 2015, robust employment growth of 2.6% was recorded, representing the addition of 50,000 jobs. Importantly, growth remains broad based. Employment gains have been posted in full-year terms by all 14 sectors reported by the CSO, with the construction sector showing particularly strong momentum. Growth also remains driven by an increase in full-time employment. Deputies will recall that the CSO, for statistical purposes, divides the economy into 14 sectors, two of which are public sectors - the other 12 are private sectors. There was no growth in employment in the public sectors because of employment embargoes but that has changed and there are people being taken on in the public sector. More importantly, all 12 private sectors of the economy have now taken on extra employees. I suppose the sector that was most tardy in recovery, the construction sector, increased employment by 10,000 persons in 2015. In parallel, consecutive declines in unemployment have been recorded over the past ten quarters. The latest data indicate that the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.6% at the end of March - the lowest since 2008. Overall, there are now 140,000 fewer unemployed people than at the peak in late 2011. Encouragingly, we continue to see significant declines in long-term unemployment indicating that carefully crafted activation strategies to date are continuing to bear fruit. This, however, is not the end point; policy efforts will continue to focus on further reducing the unemployment rate. Over the short run, we expect labour market dynamics to continue to strengthen. The Department of Finance is projecting an additional 50,000 jobs will be created this year. It is worth noting that in the early stages of the recovery, many of the jobs created were part-time jobs. In recent quarters, this has changed and there is a movement from part-time jobs to full-time jobs. The bulk of the jobs now being created are full-time jobs and this is a further strengthening of the economy. Taking all these matters into account, unemployment is forecast to remain on a downward trajectory and is expected to fall to 8% by December of this year. We remain on track to reach full employment of 2.1 million by 2018, as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs.

Underpinned by the improving economic environment, one of the main achievements of the outgoing Government has been the dramatic improvement to our fiscal position. These hard-won improvements to our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform on which funding for provision of public services can be provided for the years ahead. A clear indication of the enormous distance we have travelled can be gauged when one considers that the general government deficit was 12.6% of GDP when we took office in 2011. For this year, it is currently projected to be at 1.1% of GDP and it is projected to fall further to 0.4% of GDP next year. Therefore, we are within striking distance of a balanced budget. Underlining these developments, just last week the fiscal outturn data for 2015 indicated that the excessive deficit has been corrected in a durable manner. The underlying general government deficit for 2015 was 1.3% of GDP. This now means that Ireland should exit the excessive deficit procedure, as expected, later this summer. This means that from this year the Irish public finances will be subject to the rules of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. Our new fiscal anchor will now become the achievement of a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP. While the nominal deficit continues to decline, we still have a structural deficit. However, based on our current trajectory and assumptions set out in the stability programme, on a no-policy change basis, we are on track to achieve our medium-term objective, that is, a balanced budget in structural terms by 2018. Under this new fiscal regime, increases in public expenditure will be sustainably financed and safeguarded from dependence on cyclical revenues. These rules are designed to ensure that fiscal policy enhances economic growth and macroeconomic stability. The benefits accruing from our policy approach in managing the public finances can be seen in the expenditure and revenue trends contained in the stability programme. Over the 2015-2021 period it covers, it is forecast that on the current basis, the economy will grow by more than 35% in nominal terms resulting in more people in work and providing higher living standards. The resulting combined revenues from taxation and appropriations-in-aid are expected to increase by 25% or just under €14.5 billion. Meanwhile gross voted expenditure will increase by just 8.8%, or €4.8 billion, over this horizon. This positive differential between our revenue and expenditure growth rates will underpin our public finance dynamics over the forecast period.These positive developments are clearly seen when recent debt developments are considered. Our general Government debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at over 120% in 2012 and has declined to 94% at the end of 2015, assisted by strong economic growth and declining deficits. Furthermore, my Department is projecting a debt ratio of 88% of GDP by the end of this year, well below the euro area average. This positive trend is projected to continue on a sharp downward path over the forecast horizon. The market reaction to our management of the public finances is clear, with the cost of borrowing close to historic lows, reflecting our continued economic and fiscal improvements and assisted by wider developments. Irish bond yield movements are now trading in line with core European sovereign yields, having successfully decoupled from the eurozone periphery, to which we had become linked. In 2011, the yield on a ten-year Irish Government bonds reached 14%. Now, it has remained steady through 2016, trading at below 1%. The NTMA's last auction, on 14 April, of the ten-year bond maturing in 2026 raised €750 million at a yield of 0.82%. The Government has decided to change the medium-term objective, MTO, to -0.5% of GDP. This is not a policy change, given that a future Government is free to exceed the MTO if it so chooses. In other words, a future Minister for Finance can overachieve the MTO. It is a technical assumption. If there is a change of Government and Minister for Finance, the incoming Minister may decide to beat the MTO and continue with zero as the definition of a balanced budget. I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for raising the issue with the Taoiseach. This is why it is still a no policy change position in this paper. While the Government has indicated the way it would change policy, it does not tie an incoming Government of different personnel. The economic outlook is subject to increasing uncertainty. The upcoming referendum on Brexit and a weakening in the international outlook are key risks facing the Irish economy. While many of the risks are external, there are also internal risks. Chief among the internal risks is the risk of losing control of expenditure by adopting policies that we cannot afford. The best way to deal with these risks is through prudent management of the public finances and competitiveness-oriented policies. That is what the Government has been doing. We have come a long way. We are on the right path and we must stay on this path. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence and I thank colleagues for allowing me to over-run my time and complete my statement.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	84	The reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact, implemented as part of the obscurely named two pack of EU regulations, require member states to publish, no later than 30 April each year, their national medium-term fiscal plans in accordance with their medium-term budgetary framework. These plans are a central element of the intensified surveillance at EU-level of the conduct of national fiscal policy. In light of this requirement, the Department of Finance has published the stability programme update, SPU, for 2016. As the Minister for Finance has stated, by deciding to submit this update, the Government is complying with EU rules. However, as the foreword to the SPU makes clear, the fiscal - expenditure and tax - forecasts set out in the document are prepared on a technical, no-policy change basis in line with those set out in budget 2016 and do not take account of subsequent economic developments, potential tax buoyancy or identified expenditure pressures which will need to be addressed. Therefore, the document does not, and in the absence of an agreed programme for Government, cannot, set out a medium-term plan for Ireland's public finances. This approach is adopted given that it will be a matter for a new Government, whenever it takes office, to set out its medium-term fiscal strategy responding to the major challenges our country faces, as well as to the Commission's assessment of Ireland's fiscal position represented in the SPU. The SPU does, however, contain updated macroeconomic forecasts which, in line with the forecasts of authoritative national and international bodies, forecast an even stronger economic performance in 2016 than the Government expected last year when we presented our budget, notwithstanding the identified international uncertainties. The economic forecasts in the SPU highlight that the Irish economy has the potential to continue to generate strong growth; continue to increase employment, as the Minister set out; and generate the fiscal resources required to continue to reinforce the social, economic and financial sustainability of our State, which teetered on the brink in 2011. The SPU published in April 2011 stresses the scale of the threat faced at that time when the headline general Government deficit reached an incredible 32% of GDP for 2010. The underlying deficit, reflecting the gap, excluding the support required for the banking sector, between the Government's income and day-to-day expenditure to pay for items such as social welfare, health and public sector pay, was estimated at 12% of GDP. The April 2011 SPU confirmed that there was no scope for the State to rely on economic growth to help resolve its budgetary crisis, forecasting a decline of 1% in real GDP for 2010 with growth of only 0.8% forecast for 2011. With this scale of an economic and fiscal crisis, hardship was being experienced by people across the country, with the SPU noting that the standardised unemployment rate for the early months of 2011 was almost 15%. With Ireland in an EU-IMF programme, the choices facing the Government were very stark, not only to regain the country's economic sovereignty but to return the economy to sustainable growth and the public finances to stability. The fiscal adjustment implemented in order successfully to exit the EU-IMF programme of support and return sustainability to the public finances inevitably required a major fiscal consolidation. Adjustment measures taken from the onset of the financial crisis to restore the public finances are estimated as having amounted to one fifth of GDP. Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over €63 billion in 2009 to €54 billion in 2014. We have seen the type of measures imposed under EU-IMF programmes in other jurisdictions to achieve this scale of adjustment and their impact on the role of the State in society and on social cohesion. In Ireland, in implementing painful expenditure reductions, the Government's priority was to ensure a balanced and targeted approach was adopted in order to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible at a time of increasing demand often driven by demographic pressures. This national approach to essential fiscal adjustment during the past five years was central to maintaining social cohesion, laying firm foundations for a return to growth and restoring Ireland's economic reputation which has helped ensure the continued inflow of foreign investment. The key areas of health, social protection and education were prioritised, and together they account for over 80% of all gross current expenditure. The evidence in favour of this specific national approach to budgetary recovery is unassailable. Core weekly social welfare rates were protected. Social welfare expenditure increased as a percentage of our total budget. The investment in the health sector ensured key front-line services were maintained. The number of whole time equivalent, WTE, staff in the health sector increased from 97,010 at the end of 2013 to 105,183 in March 2016. This represents an increase of 8,173, almost 8.5%, over the period. Over 80% of this increase related to front-line staff. Free GP care is to be extended this year to children under 12.As recently highlighted in EUROSTAT data, Ireland's spending on health as a percentage of total general government expenditure was the highest in the EU in 2014. The education sector has faced increasing demands over recent years. More than 900 additional mainstream teachers and 630 new resource teachers were sanctioned for 2015 compared to the previous year. In the same period, an extra 830 special needs assistants were sanctioned, reflecting the Government's prioritisation of special needs. Budget 2016 made provision for more than 2,200 new teaching posts, including 600 new resource teachers and 100 special needs assistant posts. The staffing schedule is being reduced this year from 28:1 to 27:1 at primary level and from 19:1 to 18.7:1 at second level. The outgoing Government has protected the funding allocations for DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of young children from disadvantaged areas. Returning people to work was essential in the recovery strategy. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March of this year was 8.6%, which represented a reduction on the crushing peak of over 15% unemployment in 2011. This priority of creating jobs did not mean jobs at any price. In February 2011, the minimum wage rate was reduced from €8.65 per hour to €7.65 per hour. One of the first steps taken by the outgoing Government when it took office in March 2011 was to reverse that cut. From January of this year, the minimum wage increased to €9.15 per hour. The achievements in safeguarding and developing core social benefits and key public services within the severe constraints that existed should be viewed alongside the substantial progress that was made in returning order to the public finances. As this year's stability programme update sets out, a headline deficit of 2.3% of GDP was achieved last year with an underlying general government deficit of 1.3% of GDP. This is in sharp contrast to the 2010 figures of 32% for the headline deficit and 12% for the underlying deficit that were set out in the first stability programme update, which we published in April 2011 when we came into office. The general government deficit, on a no policy change basis, is forecast to be 1.1% in 2016. I expect this figure to be comfortably exceeded. Real growth has been revised upwards since October and is forecast to be 4.9%. General government debt is forecast to come in below 90% of GDP this year, with a net forecast of 75% of GDP. Our national debt now stands at the European average and will fall further this year. Not long ago, some of the parties opposite and indeed some of the economic commentariat were telling us that our debt was unsustainable and would prevent us from raising funds in the markets. The fiscal and economic position facing the new Government could not be more different from that we encountered when we came into office in 2011. As was the case in 1997, we are leaving office with the public finances and the economy in a far better condition than they were in when we found them. The efforts we have made to return sustainability to the public finances over recent years have ensured that increased resources will be available to the new Government to direct to ensure social and economic progress for all our people. That new opportunity should not be squandered. The real social pressures that built up during the crisis period should and must be addressed with care, speed and a strategic long-term perspective. The Irish people have paid too high a price over the past seven years to see a return to short-term political expediency trumping the long-term interests of our country.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	85	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the draft stability programme update that was published by the Department of Finance last night. I concur with those who have made the point that additional time should have been provided to study the document. I have read it but I would have liked more time to consider it in more detail. I have some initial comments to make. The stability programme update must be read alongside the speeches that have been made by the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, this morning. We got a significant new piece of information about a change in the medium-term objective when we were told that the Government is availing of the additional fiscal leeway that the European Commission has allowed in order to move from a medium-term objective of having a balanced budget in structural terms to having a deficit of 0.5%. According to the speech we heard from the Minister, Deputy Noonan, this change will ultimately provide additional resources - one can call it "fiscal space" if one wishes - of approximately €1.5 billion. This will increase the projected overall fiscal space, or available resources, for the period from 2017 to 2021 to between €10 billion and €11 billion. Of course all of this is based on assumptions and projections. In the shorter term, the context of budget 2017 is now becoming clearer. When we received the most recent set of forecasts at the time of last October's budget, the expectation was that budget 2017 would have approximately €500 million of available resources. In the course of the discussions on Government formation we have engaged in over recent weeks, it was indicated to us that this figure was to increase to between €700 million and €800 million. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has confirmed today that the figure is now likely to be approximately €900 million. This significant shift means that additional resources are available, which in turn will create issues around expectations and deciding on what this country's priorities should be. As a party, Fianna Fáil very much welcomes the broad-based economic recovery that is now well under way. The priority for the incoming Government and for this Dáil, working collectively, must be to secure the economic recovery in the first instance. Only after we have made sure it is a fair and inclusive recovery can we decide what to prioritise as we make decisions on how to use the resources generated by that recovery. From our perspective as a political party, the whole purpose of having a strong economy is to deliver a fair society. That will be our pitch throughout the term of this Dáil as we set out our policy priorities. I will touch on a few of those priorities in a moment. This is the first significant debate in the Dáil on economic matters since the recent general election. Along with my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, I look forward to a detailed engagement on the floor of the House and in the Oireachtas committees on a broad range of economic issues. We are very conscious of the responsibility placed on us by the Irish public. The prudent management of the economy is central to the fulfilment of that responsibility. I commend the officials in the Department of Finance on the work they did in preparing this document. The political backdrop to their efforts meant they had to work amid a great deal of uncertainty. This document, which is dry by its very nature, is important because it sets out the economic landscape which this country is now facing. I wish to reiterate the key priorities of Fianna Fáil's economic strategy, as set out by my colleagues and I during the general election campaign. We are in favour of maintaining a supportive macroeconomic environment and sound public finances. We recognise that expenditure-increasing or revenue-reducing measures depend on projected economic growth. The projections remain quite strong, with growth of 4.9% projected for this year. We believe in improving the incentive to work and the reward from work through reductions in the tax burden, with an emphasis on those on low and middle incomes and the self-employed. A greater emphasis on maintaining and improving our cost base through ensuring competitiveness is a central consideration in policy-making. We believe in reducing operating costs and delivering improvements in infrastructure, skills and the banking sector. Over the course of this Dáil, we will flesh out our policies across a range of areas relating to these items and seek to build Dáil support for such measures. That is the new political reality in which we will all now operate. There is a need to try to build consensus, challenge one another more robustly and build support for measures that are being introduced. The stability programme update we are debating today makes it clear that the risks to the Irish economy are now at their highest level since 2008. Indeed, the most acute risk - that Britain, which is our nearest neighbour, will leave the EU - will be determined within two months. This is a stark reality that we need to consider. When Ireland previously held referendums on its relationship with the EU, people voted on a specific treaty and, as such, it was a more straightforward task to work out exactly what the consequences of a vote in one direction or the other would be.That is not the case in the situation now facing the United Kingdom. It is unknown at this stage what relationship Britain would have with the rest of the world, including Ireland, post-Brexit. Given the very deep and important economic ties between Ireland and the United Kingdom, this would have huge implications for Ireland. Much of the election campaign discussion centred on how much money would be available in the next few years, on which issue I touched in my opening remarks. The way in which that debate proceeded left the public bewildered. The report does not address that issue definitively, although we have been given some additional information by the Minister on the floor of the House today. I note that the Government is now accepting that there will be an easing of the fiscal target in the context of the medium-term objective, MTO. At this stage I would like to reaffirm the position of Fianna Fáil as a political party. We affirm our commitment to meeting in full the domestic and EU fiscal rules. If Ireland's medium-term objective is revised by Government decision to a deficit of 0.5%, as now appears to be the case, in our view, Ireland should continue to target a balanced budget in both headline and structural terms. In simple terms, if we accept the slightly easier deficit target, we should continue to aim to outperform it. That is the Fianna Fáil position on the issue. Fianna Fáil was the first party to come forward with proposals for a rainy day fund, which proposals we will outline in more detail to the House when normal business resumes. We also have many ideas about reform of the budgetary process. The Dáil reform committee is dealing with this issue, but in our view politics is entering a new era, one in which the ideas of Deputies on all sides of the House will have to be listened to in a meaningful way and considered for implementation. This new era also brings an entirely different way of considering budgetary measures. This process of scrutiny will have to commence long before the deadline of mid-October. That is the bottom line and we are all going to have to accept the new reality. It is Fianna Fáil's belief that the focus of additional resources should be on improving public services and reversing some of the most damaging cuts, while at the same time outlining a pathway to reform and reduce the burden of taxation, with particular emphasis on low and middle incomes. The split in terms of expenditure and taxation should, in our view, broadly be 2:1, such that in the context of budget 2017 and there being €900 million available, the split should be approximately €600 million for investment in public services and €300 million for a tax package. The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, is likely to hold a senior position in the incoming Government. Its number one priority must be tackling the housing emergency which has moved beyond the point of crisis at this stage. The issues of homelessness, the shortage of rental accommodation, as well as social housing accommodation, and the lack of a private housing supply are interconnected. What is required is an ambitious social housing building programme. There is also a need to address the barriers that are preventing a private housing supply from coming on stream. Tinkering at the edges will not address the issue. The fundamental challenge facing the incoming Government and the Dáil collectively is addressing of what is now a national emergency in housing provision. Fianna Fáil will be constructive in bringing forward ideas and proposals to help address the crisis.  I am glad to have had an opportunity to make some initial points on this issue. I look forward over the course of this Dáil term to working collaboratively on economic issues, acting in the national interest, in building on economic recovery, ensuring it is fair and inclusive, such that we use the fruits of the recovery to set out our vision for the country, while protecting decent public services and rewarding those who have an opportunity to work.

There is much talk about a new dawn, new politics and there being no more surprises in budgets. There is no reason this debate could not have been scheduled for later this evening or tomorrow. It has been stated the Commission must receive this document tomorrow. However, as far as I am aware, the ultimate deadline is the end of the month. This is the wrong way to do business. It is treating Members of the House with disdain, particularly those whose responsibility it is, on behalf of their parties or groups, to tease out the detail and compare it with other budget documents, stability programme updates, EU data and so on. It was wrong for this debate to be scheduled prior to Members having time to scrutinise the document. That said, I have read it, although I have not scrutinised it in as detailed a manner as I would like. The document contains a wealth of information that needs to be parsed and examined in detail. This work would usually have been undertaken next week by a committee, but it may be a number of weeks before a committee is established. This debate, while welcome, will not get to the detail or nuts and bolts of all of the issues involved. We may need an interim measure such as the Minister making available his officials to spokespersons to go through the document in detail.

On the Minister's statement and that of the Taoiseach, that there is no policy change, of course, there is a policy change. Let us accept that. What we are dealing with are important issues for the State. The MTO change is a significant policy change. It will allow us to achieve our medium-term objectives in 2018 if we, as a country, or the Government, accept that the figure is 0.5%. The outflow is that the fiscal space increases by €1.5 billion. We are not talking about pennies or pounds. This is a huge policy change, one with which I agree. The European Commission sets the minimum medium-term objectives. The medium-term objective accepted by the Government has to be included in the stability programme update. It is a policy change, as stated in black and white on the first page of the document, and we should not pretend that it is otherwise because those who may disagree with it should know that it is a policy change and the consequences and either accept it as either being good or bad. From my point of view, it is good.

I know that the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, was trying to save the blushes of the Taoiseach earlier this morning, but these issues, in the context of the figure of €1.5 billion involved, deserve more than an attempt to save the blushes of the Taoiseach. We should be asking ourselves if accepting a medium-term objective of 0.5% is the right thing to do in the interests of the country. This is a policy change and the way we need to judge it should be based on the risks the country will face in the future. On paper, the economy is doing very well. I note from the data that in terms of GDP, our growth rates are outperforming those of countries such as India. However, behind these figures are issues unique to Ireland. We know from economists who study the performance of the economy that the GDP figure is not a good reflection of where we are as a country. Looking at the headline figures for investment one would form the view that investment in Ireland was growing, but when one gets into the detail, one discovers that the basis for it is that a small number of multinationals have located intellectual properties in ireland, which has bumped up the figures. If these are stripped out, it shows that there is a lack of investment in the country. There is a major problem in that while these multinational corporations provide much needed employment here and some tax receipts, although not enough, this skews the figures for overall GDP which then also causes major problems when we are considering how the resources of the economy should be divvied up.One thing that is very clear from the document is that one can see the trend in the next few years in total expenditure and tax revenue based on a no-change policy. One can see that it will go from 32.8% of total revenues in relation to GDP last year to 29.4% in 2021. They are the tax revenue figures. What the Government is planning to do and what Fianna Fáil want to do is reduce that figure further. When the Taoiseach says he wants a taxation stimulus, like that in the USA, he does not need to worry as the Government already has it. We have lower taxes than in the USA. The Government is already projecting a figure of 29.4% based on a no-change policy, yet it wants to reduce taxes further and reduce the resources that come to the State. Expenditure last year was at a figure of 35%, which based on a no-change policy in the next five years would go to 26.6%. Of course, some of the fiscal space is going to be used to increase expenditure and there will be demographic and other pressures. The problem is that, even with that fiscal space available, we are going to see expenditure levels as a proportion of GDP reduced.

As well as the fiscal space, there is a figure of €900 million included in the base which, would not have been the case in previous years for demographics, capital programmes and the Lansdowne Road agreement. The expenditure figure is much bigger than it was historically.

On the problem with these figures, we heard an example yesterday in the debate on mental health services. There is €12 million being stripped away from mental health services, yet we have the highest suicides rates in the European Union for females aged between 15 and 19 years and people across the State who are unable to access mental health supports from the HSE and a hospital system that is in absolute crisis. Expenditure pressures have been identified at a figure of about 0.25% of GDP, or about €580 million. It is said this will be accommodated within the fiscal space, but we need the detail from the Minister. Where are the expenditure pressures-----

On the increase in the net fiscal space from €500 million to €900 million, there should be a technical paper. In this day and age, the Minister cannot come into the Dáil and simply say, "By the way, the amount of money we can spend in the budget next year has nearly doubled." Those days are gone. That is Charlie McCreevy style. The Opposition wishes to engage on what is in the best interests of the country, with different ideologies on investment, public services and so on but with the same principle of wanting what is best for the country, not wanting to bankrupt it, as has happened under previous Governments. If the Government wants to treat the Opposition with respect, we need the papers to back it up. We need the papers that explain where the other €400 million in the net fiscal space for this year is coming from. There has to be a series of engagements all the way through to the budget when the figures are being hardened up during the summer months. On some of the risks involved, we have had a debate on Brexit, on which Sinn Féin is campaigning on part of the island for a "No" vote. The implications are something we have raised consistently through Senator Kathryn Reilly in the committee on Brexit. Carbon credits are mentioned in the document as one of the risks. We will have to spend hundreds of millions of euro because we will not reach our targets in 2020. That needs to be quantified. We have seen from the replies to previous parliamentary questions that on one element of it, we are probably going to be out by about 2% and that each 1% will cost the State about €150 million. We also do not know what the greenhouse gases effect will mean in terms of cost. We need an estimation of the risks involved.

These data lead us to what the priorities of the country should be. One of the major challenges the country faces is posed by capital investment. We have the second lowest level of capital investment in Europe. That is not acceptable or sustainable. We have discussed Irish Water, on which there will be a debate later. In the context of that debate, what is required is investment in water infrastructure. How we fund that investment is the big issue in terms of whether we use water charges. That is a minor issue in terms of the actual need for investment.

I register my protest in that regard. Before I get into the substance of the stability programme, I point out that there is no mention whatsoever of the issue of water, yet we have pronouncements from the European Union this week which essentially imply that it would be reckless to get rid of the water charges regime and Irish Water because we have commitments in terms of water conservation and water quality. These sentiments were echoed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party and Fine Gael. My God - the European Union, Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Labour Party have some neck in talking about water conservation. They were the ones who slashed the capital programme for water infrastructure. The reason we have sewage floating out to sea and the reason we have failed to deal with the chronic problem in water infrastructure is the troika and their puppets in the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and the subsequent Fine Gael-Labour Party Government slashed the capital programme. It was those of us who are opposing water charges and Irish Water who opposed these capital cuts. The real test is going to be when we get water charges and Irish Water off the pitch and start to argue about how much money we need to fix the water infrastructure. I bet that yet again the Government - Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil - will be on the wrong side of the argument. The truth is that Irish Water's investment programme is pathetic. We need to increase it significantly. More generally, as alluded to, we need to significantly up the capital investment programme which has collapsed across the board and produced not just a crisis in water infrastructure but also the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State and a desperate deficit in the level of investment needed for things such as primary care services, hospitals and a range of other infrastructure. In the stability update the capital investment programme is set to move from the current level of about €5 billion a year to only €6 billion by 2017. That is a marginal improvement. This represents a collapse of investment compared to what it was in 2008, when the figure was €8.6 billion. Even by 2017, according to the outlook presented, we will still be spending more than €2 billion less in areas such as water services, housing and other vital infrastructure than we were spending in 2008. In this regard, the elephant in the room is the leve of debt interest. That is the issue. We will still be chronically under-investing in vital infrastructure such as housing and water services, while simultaneously paying out €8 billion in interest this year and for years to come. Money has been sucked out of vital spending on infrastructure. That brings me to the point about risks. The Government states we must be careful in dealing with the external risks which have been heightened - they most certainly are when one looks at the situation in China - as well as the internal risk of spending too much. No, the risk is not that we will spend too much. The risk is that we will spend too little, in terms of capital investment, in boosting domestic industry and enterprise and developing the domestic economy in a way that will insulate it from domestic shocks.Most certainly, that investment should not be sourced from debt. On this, I agree. We do not want to inflate our debt and put our economy in hock to international bondholders. The best way to progress is to repudiate the private financial debt on which we are forking out €8 billion a year and increase capital investment and current expenditure by redistributing some of the wealth in our economy by making the corporations and the super rich pay their taxes. We should proceed not by debt financing but by redistribution of wealth.

Obviously, we had to drag a debate out of the Government and only got it when a deal on water was done in a backroom. On the stability programme, the Government went to the European Commission and said we do not really have a Government and that maybe we cannot produce the stability programme update. The Commission said it wanted the stability programme update by the end of the month. The Government then said that it would produce a document at 10 o'clock one night and that the next day it would have a discussion in the Dáil so it could tick the box and say it was discussed in the national Parliament. It shows the way that Europe operates and the power of the undemocratic, unelected European Commission that the Government simply goes along with it.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	103	I think Deputy Durkan will find that we are all in Europe. When people look at this stability programme debate, the key question they will ask is "Stability for who?". We do not all have the same interests in this State. There can be stability for some at the expense of others. That is what has happened so far. There is massive stability for the richest people in our society. The Sunday Times published its rich list at the weekend showing an increase of approximately 3% for the richest 250 people in personal wealth over the course of the last year alone. There is a great deal of stability for corporations whose profits have increased by 31% from €35 billion to €52 billion from 2009 to 2014. At the same time, the taxes paid by corporations increased by only 18%. There is a great deal of stability, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, for the bondholders who get their private debts paid for by ordinary people on a yearly basis like clockwork. On the other hand, there is massive instability in people's lives. Hourly wages are still lower than they were at the start of the crisis. Of all children, 40% are living in conditions of multiple deprivation. Of workers, one quarter receive less than the living wage. We have a massive housing and homelessness crisis.  How does that tally with the growth figures presented? It tallies in two ways. First, the growth figures are massively inflated because of the fact that corporations use Ireland as, in effect, a tax haven. That means GDP figures in particular, but also GNP figures due to contract manufacturing, are massively inflated. They do not reflect the reality. The increase in consumer expenditure of approximately 3% is more real in terms of what is actually happening in the economy. Second, even taking that some level of recovery exists, such recovery is fundamentally unequal. There is no greater illustration of that than the Panama papers we have seen exposing global operations by the super rich and large corporations to avoid paying tax in whatever way possible to the extent of stashing away massive amounts of money. In terms of Ireland, a recent report set out that 1,400 of the richest people here avoided paying €250 million in 2013 using legal tax breaks. For the 1%, there are Panama accounts. For us, there are deteriorating public services and attempts to take property tax from people. The nature of stability for them at the expense of instability for ordinary people is not going to change as long as the policies and politics of neoliberalism and austerity remain in place. This whole procedure of the European semester - the two pack, the six pack and the notion of fiscal space - is all designed to ensure that stays in place. The world economy has not been discussed enough today. There will be a further shock in the world economy. It is almost nine years since the start of this massive, deep crisis of capitalism and there has been no recovery. There is persistent deflation, low levels of growth in the advanced economies and very high levels of unemployment. A further shock is going to come, most likely from China, and the unsustainable model of Irish capitalism is going to be exposed. It is a model of hoping another Celtic tiger is going to come along and of not making corporations pay their taxes instead of developing a sustainable manufacturing and industrial base here. We need an alternative model. In my view, it is a socialist model. It is about making the rich and the corporations pay their taxes but it is also about breaking the straitjacket of EU fiscal rules and of capitalism, refusing to pay the debt that is not our debt, a nationalised public banking system and public ownership of the key sections of the economy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	104	Under the pact, EU Governments are supposed to bring their deficits to below 3% of GDP and debts are not supposed to be higher than 60% of GDP. However, the rules seem to allow some budget items to be stripped out, including the cost of extraordinary events. It looks like Italy, Lithuania, Austria, Spain and France are going to break the rules around the 3% in 2016 and yet Ireland insists on being a real good boy. We do not want to break the rules. Recently, the Commission said that the budgetary impact of the exceptional inflow of refugees would be taken into account when assessing possible deviations from the rules for 2015 and 2016. Finance Ministers have already said they wanted money spent on dealing with the current flow of refugees not to count towards national deficits under the block's budgetary rules. France says it has huge security concerns and, oh, may have to break the rules as well. Rome has requested extra leeway within the EU rules worth 0.2% of GDP to compensate for extraordinary costs incurred on foot of the refugee crisis. In Ireland, there is a lack of social housing and of affordable private housing. There is a lack of affordable rental units. What we have is a lack of money and of political will to address the problem. We are not building houses. One of the main reasons is that the Government has waited on the private sector - the markets - to come in and do the business for the last five years but that has not happened. If the Government wants to solve the housing crisis, it must start spending money. Where is it going to get it? I suggest it does what Lithuania, Italy, France, Spain and Austria are doing and breaks the rules. What about us borrowing €10 billion at less than 1% in order to invest in housing? It is not rocket science and would make a great deal of sense. Aside from the fact that the State needs to directly build social housing in the range of approximately €10 billion in the next two years to alleviate the problem, it should organise finance if it wants the private sector to build houses also, which it does, as the banks will not provide it. One cannot get money out of a bank in Ireland today to build houses unless one is a US investment fund, in which case one would not need it. US funds have access to their own money. Irish builders cannot get money to build houses. A scheme must be designed whereby the Government - the State - plays a role in raising finance in order to stimulate the construction of housing. If the next Government is not prepared to challenge Europe, as France, Spain, Italy, Lithuania and Austria are prepared to do, it will be a disgrace. The refugee crisis in Europe is a terrible one. I agree that countries should be given leeway to deal with it. That is a far better reason than allowing the French to spend billions of euro on security after the ISIS attack, which was a response to France's bombing the living daylights out of homes in Iraq and Syria. How can anyone argue that our drastic housing crisis does not merit extra help from Europe and leeway in the rules? If the French security issue is worth breathing space in the fiscal rules, how in God's name can Europe argue that we are not entitled to the same? It has even told us that our infrastructural investment levels are too low. They are some of the lowest in Europe. This is a no-brainer.

He was protesting too much, bragging about social welfare rates increasing under the last Government when that was really a reflection of the wealth transfer to the wealthy and a compensation for the poor wages being paid. The Government's strategy is wrong, as was summed up by the Minister, Deputy Noonan's remarks on the economic recovery being most clearly evident in the labour market. That is precisely the area in which the problems in the economy are the most evident. In the 1950s, we brought workers back from Britain to build houses. Not so long ago, someone could leave school and get a permanent and pensionable job in a local authority. Now, we have the spectre of graduates working in repeat internships or JobBridge schemes for low wages. Our new recruits in the public sector, be they gardaí or nurses, get less per hour than a worker in Aldi or Lidl. It is a race to the bottom and we are building a low-wage economy based on neoliberal economic policies that the stability programme is designed to perpetuate and develop further. The programme update tells us that we will formally exit the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, this summer. That should be great cause for celebration - hooray, hooray - but we must remind ourselves as we pop the champagne why we were in the programme in the first place and why the public was shackled and put on the hook for billions of euro in gambling debts in which we had no hand, act or part. Coming out of the EDP, we will go straight into the new austerity of the preventative measures of the Stability and Growth Pact under which we must achieve our medium-term budgetary objective, MTO. Deputy Pearse Doherty was correct, in that a change has been proposed today. It is sickening and insulting to democracy that we have a Government with zero mandate from the electorate. Face it - the Government took a hounding. It has no authority to endorse any document in the name of the Irish people-----

It is a disgrace and is only being done because the Government is doffing the cap yet again to the European Commission officials, who made it clear in the bilateral talks with the Irish delegation on 6 April that they expected Dublin to make a submission on time. The Government said, "That is grand, master. No problem. We will do that". The problem is that institutionalised neoliberalism and budgetary surveillance by unelected bureaucrats in the European Commission were enshrined in the six-pack agreement. Deputy Wallace is correct about that. The six-pack is one of the reasons offered as to why we cannot borrow to build social housing, in that doing so would push us over the 3% central government deficit-GDP figure. It is a nonsense and an insult to democracy. In a recent article, Professor John Weeks of the University of London discussed the authoritarianism of the EU and the six-pack. He stated:It asserts the power of the unelected European Commission, as the executive of the European Union, to monitor ("detect") whether the public budget of an elected member government conforms to EU fiscal rules. If it does not, the Commission claims the power to prevent the implementation of that budget, then to specify the changes ("corrections") required.Is this the EU democracy that the Tánaiste told the Dáil was so wonderful last week? We are signing up to enforced perpetual economic stagnation in Europe. Economies that could previously use their budgets to stimulate public expenditure and growth are being hamstrung. According to Professor Weeks, who put it much better than me, we are forcing "member governments to apply policies analogous to the practice 200 years ago of bloodletting to restore health to the ill". I am not prepared to let the blood of the Irish people any longer, but a Government with no mandate believes that it can.

The stability programme update is a serious document. It is the start of the budgetary process, as acknowledged in official documentation. It is not just a technical and statistical document, as the Taoiseach called it this morning. The update sets the country's expenditure ceilings for next year. This document frames the budget. As such, a detailed discussion of its contents is important. For example, a table in last year's update made all manner of highly technical adjustments to the likes of the expected growth and inflation rates that radically changed the fiscal space that was available this year. Things that are happening and not happening in Ireland today are directly related to the technical analysis contained in last year's stability programme update. This is not a technical and statistical backup analysis. It frames the entire budgetary process. Let us consider what has happened. We got this document at 10 p.m. last night but were not told about it, so I only picked it up at 7:30 a.m. this morning. We found out yesterday that there would be statements on this important document today. The acting Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, entered the Chamber, made speeches that they had clearly had a great deal of time and resources to prepare, tolerated Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty and then left. With genuine respect for the Minister who is sitting opposite representing the Government, her Department is Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. This debate is nonsense.

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that he would take on board feedback from the Chamber. How can we give meaningful feedback with approximately two hours' preparation, no meeting with Department of Finance officials and no briefings? It cannot be done. Even if it could, how could the Ministers possibly take our feedback and incorporate it into this document? The Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that the document had to be with the European Commission by tomorrow or Friday at the latest. I am calling out what is happening. This is meant to be new politics and political reform. Last autumn, the OECD drafted a thorough review of Ireland's budgetary process.It states: "To be effective, the measures proposed above [namely, the measures coming out of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for better parliamentary engagement] will need to be underpinned by a renewed commitment by Government, at political and administrative levels, to engage with the Oireachtas as a partner throughout the budget process." It is difficult to explain quite how I feel about what is going on here this morning without using unparliamentary language so I will leave it at that. What is before us is nonsense. It is an insult to the Dáil, the Independents and the political parties. The finance spokespeople or other appointed Members would gladly have met finance officials and the two relevant Ministers. This is important stuff. On the back page of the documentation, page 47, there is a copy of the letter from Professor John McHale in his capacity as chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. It is dated 20 April. That was quite some time ago as it is now 27 April. A week ago, Professor McHale was able to write to the general secretary and state the council was provided with the SPU forecast on 7 April, which is 20 days ago. Twenty days ago, the Department gave these figures to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. Seven days ago, the council wrote back to the Department and said it was broadly satisfied with its projections. Today, the day before the document must legally be sent to Europe, we in the Dáil finally get to see it and debate it without either of the Ministers present. I actually had several questions for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, based on what they had to say.

Why is the fiscal space not laid out in the document? Does the underlying fiscal space include projected overruns of €500 million? How is the projected overrun broken down? What percentage of inflation assumption has been applied to the expenditure ceiling for this year? Last year, the assumption was incorrect. In the time I have left for what is essentially a meaningless debate, I contend it is good news that we hear from the Ministers that the fiscal space is potentially €900 million. If we have expenditure overruns – the SPU says we could have them to the tune of €500 million but I believe they will amount to much more – the figure will come down. However, it is imperative that whatever fiscal space is available be used for investment. Part of the debate defining the election campaign concerned whether the universal social charge should be abolished. The Social Democrats took a position contending that we need to maintain the existing tax base, and the Government said we should cut taxes further. We found out yesterday that the rolling out of the broadband programme will be delayed by up to two years. We found out yesterday that patients in the public health system are awaiting up to 25 times longer than patients in the private system for important oncology scans. We know from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors that the Garda needs to hire and train approximately 800 additional gardaí and that the force is under-resourced to the tune of 20%. We know that one in nine children in the country is living in consistent poverty. We know that the capital expenditure programme set out in this stability programme update is one of the lowest in the EU, which opens us up to very significant social and economic risks and challenges. The argument given by the outgoing Government to reduce the tax base further was that we need to “make work pay”. I believe that is the phrase that was used. Last week, the OECD released the latest analysis of the so-called tax wedge for 34 OECD countries. This is a combination of tax on work and tax on employers related to work. It shows that for a married couple with one earner and two children, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the OECD. Of the four examples given, Ireland was among the lowest seven countries in terms of tax on work in the OECD. We do not need to erode the tax base further. We need to maintain a stable tax base and invest. I request, as did Deputy Doherty, that detailed briefings, although they are too late for the stability programme update, be provided by the Department of Finance. We need to start preparing for the budgetary cycle now. We will need access to finance officials to go through a lot of this in detail.

It is an important point. Can I address the substance? It is welcome that we at least have the chance. I am glad that, even at the last minute prior to this document being sent off to Brussels, we have this chance.However, we should return to this issue. Rather than having the Minister provide a further five-minute statement at the end of this debate, the Dáil, in ordering its business either this week or next, should provide some form of mechanism to allow responses to be made to Deputies' contributions. In the absence of a committee, the Dáil should be able to order its business in a way that allows interaction and real debate. We must heed the point made in the Nyberg, Regling-Watson and Honohan reports that groupthink and a lack of questioning, dialogue and interaction are among the main reasons we got ourselves into economic difficulties.  One of the changes I would like to make relates to long and medium-term risks. Is it possible to adjust the risk analysis featured in table 16 on page 26 of the stability programme update? Political instability should be included with domestic risks. The way in which the Dáil and a new minority Government work poses one of the greatest risks to our economic circumstances. This factor should be reflected in the report. While it would be difficult for the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to make this change, it is required if we are to be accurate and honest about the economic risks we face.  The other two risks are loss of competitiveness, which is set out in the update, and the underinvestment in capital expenditure over the past five years to which a number of Deputies alluded. Having criticised the absence of certain Ministers, I will respond to a point made by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett. During the difficult period in which the Green Party was in government, it was our shared assessment that, in responding to the crisis, we had to avoid imposing an excessive reduction in the capital budget. As Minister, I was engaged in an investment plan for clean energy involving expenditure of approximately €30 billion. Unfortunately, this proposed investment was subsequently cut. The Green Party also insisted that any troika agreement make provision for financing and building the Dublin metro, including European Investment Bank funding for the project. I regret that this project was also cut.  Deputy Boyd Barrett also referred to Irish Water. I am proud that expenditure on water and wastewater services under the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, was twice as high as it has been in the past five years. We spent €500 million per annum on this area because we recognised it as a priority. There is common agreement that the low level of capital expenditure presents one of the greatest risks to the economy. Some of our infrastructure bottlenecks present the greatest risk to the economy and its growth rates of between 4% and 5%. Competitiveness risks are related to infrastructure investment because the cost of providing housing, especially in Dublin, is increasing pressure for wage rises. This issue affects our competitiveness.  I welcome the change in the medium-term objective to allow us to increase expenditure. I would target any such increase on housing in the forthcoming budget. I understand this could be done within European rules because a smoothing exercise applies to each four-year period during which capital expenditure is measured. As a result, an increase in expenditure next year could be multiplied without breaking the medium-term objective or the other stability criteria. Capital expenditure and current expenditure are accounted for differently. The scale of expenditure on housing could and should be ramped up radically because housing, as several speakers noted, is the biggest crisis we face.  Public investment should drive housing construction. If, as the Construction Industry Federation argues, Central Bank limits are keeping housing prices below the cost of housing, making housing construction unfeasible, the State should build homes. Removing the 15% profit margin achieved by the private sector would allow us to close the gap. Further, the development of the cost-rental model set out by the National Economic and Social Council would allow us to raise funding for a public housing programme elsewhere. I understand Austria and other countries which operate such a programme are able to do this off balance sheet. This would provide greater leeway to tackle the current underinvestment in housing.  I would like to change the risk assessments to reflect a second crisis, namely, the crisis in the transport systems of our major cities, specifically Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. The economy is growing at a rate of 5%, yet there are no major large rail-based public transport projects ready to go. As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Lahart, will know from his locality, the traffic system is grinding to a halt as the M50 enters gridlock. These risks to the economy need to be reflected in the stability programme update. There is a commensurate need to radically increase expenditure on bus networks and walking and cycling infrastructure as the first immediate response to these risks.  In addition to the immediate challenges I have outlined, we also face challenges in health and education. The provision of funding for third level education, for example, must be tackled immediately.  I hope the Dáil or a committee will be able to debate these issues further and some of the political issues we face will be overcome. We could use the proposed medium-term review set out in the capital programme to do some serious thinking about the long-term investment we will make in capital spending to get the national spatial strategy right. We must ensure we do not build houses by numbers and instead build the right types of housing in the right places. We must also address the climate change challenge by radically ramping up investment in new, clean energy and efficient systems that will make the country more productive. If a Government can be formed, it should spend time working to achieve consensus on strategic investments in order that capital expenditure, when ramped up from 2018-19 onwards, is allocated to areas that make sense.

The Proclamation includes the following statement: "We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible". Sadly, successive Governments, in particular the most recent Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and its predecessor, the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, surrendered our sovereignty and economic independence. As a result, the glossy brochure before us amounts to a programme for continued austerity for low and middle income families. The fiscal treaty rules previous Governments allowed the European Union to impose on us and the annual debt interest repayments of €7 billion that flow out of this country have a practical outcome for every household. They mean a continuation of the chaos in the health services, an ongoing housing and homelessness crisis, with more than 100,000 families on local authority housing waiting lists, major problems in the mental health service, underfunding of education and roads that are almost impassable in most, if not all, counties.  To mitigate the debt repayment provisions of the fiscal treaty, virtually all Irish fixed assets, including many homes, have been sold off to international vulture capitalists. If one pays to use the facilities in a shopping centre, part of the 10 cent charge will go to Texas Capital Bank, Allianz or a similar company. The Twenty-six Counties Exchequer is paying €7 billion per annum on debts incurred to avoid taxing the super-rich and repay the gambling debts of international investors who invested in Irish banks. Rents and loan repayments from businesses and home owners pour out of the country to international capitalists. UCD economics professor, Morgan Kelly, says that Irish small and medium sized businesses owe €28 billion. It is probable that research would show there is a higher proportion of Irish output pouring out of the country now than was the case before the land league campaign led by Michael Davitt commenced in the late 1800s.  The fiscal treaty agreed following the Lisbon treaty has created a new colonialism in Europe. This treaty flies in the face of the 1916 Proclamation. It is not a sovereignty sharing treaty. It effectively sets aside Irish sovereignty and hands it over to big European Union powers. It must be renegotiated. This could best be done in the framework of a debt neutralisation conference. Ireland should demand such a conference and seek support for it from other peripheral countries such as Greece, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain and others. We must seek the renegotiation of the fiscal treaty and the halting and cessation of the payment of €7 billion in debt servicing which is crucifying families across the country. The Taoiseach told us approximately 18 months ago that we would see a game change and that this €7 billion would be wiped out. Of course that never happened. It must happen now if ordinary families, low and middle income families, are to have a reasonable standard of living in the future.

If anything underlines the emptiness of new politics, it is being given a document today with no time to read it. If anything underlines the emptiness of our ongoing celebration of our independence, it is being told that we can make no input into this document and that it is going to Europe with or without any discussion here. The Minister for Finance has described this document simply as a statistical document. That is utterly contemptuous of the elected Members in this Chamber. I am going to balance the statistics referred to by the Minister, which we have not had a chance to go into, despite my best efforts, with other statistics. I will begin with mental health. Yesterday, I spent three hours in the Chamber and had with me, but did not get a chance to use it, A Vision for Change. Page 106 of that document refers to the ongoing cost per year of mental health issues as €11 billion. I will repeat that figure because I had grave difficulty with the figure, which is extrapolated from Northern Irish figures. On a pro rata population basis, the document suggests a total annual cost of mental health of €11 billion. That is what it is costing us by not dealing with and funding mental health properly. Domestic violence is another issue. Two weeks ago or less, a conference on domestic violence suggested the ongoing cost of this to the economy is €2.2 billion per year and yet this is not mentioned today in any statistic here. As mentioned by Fianna Fáil, we have a national emergency in housing, with 120,000 households on a waiting list. Galway city, with which I am familiar, has 15,000 people - 5,000 households - on the housing waiting list, some that have waited for up to 15 years for a home. We get blinded by figures, so I repeat that figure - 15,000 people. However, there is no mention of that here. We have almost the lowest rate of investment in infrastructure in Europe but there is no mention of that here. Some 35,000 young people left Ireland last year but there is no mention of that anywhere here. On women and gender, women represent 60% of all low paid workers in Ireland. A half of women workers earn less than €20,000. This is below the medium level but there is no mention of that. Our health system is causing problems. The system itself is unhealthy and is not dealing with people who are sick and yet there is no mention of that here. I do not subscribe to an economy that looks on all of these issues as inevitable problems. They are not inevitable problems but problems that have been created by this very policy. However, even within this policy, there is scope. As we have been told, there is a fiscal space and yet there has been no passionate outpouring from the Government and new politics that they will use this fiscal space to address inequalities in society. There is mention in this document of risk assessment. There is a huge risk to our economy if we do not deal with mental health and if we do not provide homes quickly. There is an even greater risk in regard to domestic violence because it permeates every generation and every aspect of society. At a conservative estimate, it costs €60,000 to follow up on one victim of domestic violence. I would at the least have expected some discussion today, having been given time to look at the document, on how we could participate on the basis of "consensus", a wonderful word used by the Green Party. I certainly have a lot to say on behalf of the people who gave me the privilege of being here today. I am not here to be castigated by various people on either side who tell us we have not taken part in government. I have been here every day since I was elected. I have researched, prepared and stood up here but I am talking to an empty Dáil, as are other committed people here. This debate is absolutely empty rhetoric in regard to new politics. Finally, the fiscal council was mentioned by Deputy Donnelly. It has a very restricted role and remit. At the least, we should be discussing how its remit could be expanded so as to examine the implications of recommendations coming from it in terms of equality and poverty.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23054	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	158	I welcome the opportunity to have this debate. I would say, particularly to new Deputies, that no Deputy in this House has a monopoly on compassion. Elected Members from all sides of the House have come here with a mandate to try to do the best they can for their people. We all see the challenges in housing, mental health, education and in trying to provide jobs for our people. We all also know that the country has come from a difficult place and is on a journey we need to sustain. We need to look at the needs of a strong economy and of delivering services to people as two sides of the same coin. The truth is that looking at our budget situation today, we do not have any resources to spend on new programmes. It will not be until 2018 that we will see a balanced budget. If we look at the economic success we have had in the past five years, with 142,000 people back at work, the tragedy of that success is that although it generated €10 billion in recovery, 75% of that money had to be put into filling the black hole that was left by the crash. We must recognise that we are a small and open trading economy and to survive and grow in that environment, we must be able to win new export markets. It is interesting to look at this stability report in comparison with the one in 2011 when the Government entered power. The contrast is dramatic. At that stage, we were borrowing 10% of GDP but that is now down to 1%. Borrowing in the open markets was costing us 14% but that is now down to under 1%. We had just lost 300,000 jobs in our economy but now we have created 140,000. This is not being complacent about the future but recognises that we have rebuilt, not on the old fault lines of construction and so on that caused the crash, but on new sectors such as IT, food and tourism, sectors with a strong sustainable future. It is interesting to compare the stability report with the report of 2011 and the forecasts for where the country would be in 2015. We have made significant strides and come out much better than forecast. The investment rates are more than double what was predicted in 2015 and the rate of increase in exports has more than doubled. The number of people at work is 63,000 more than was expected. We have to realise, however, that sustaining this progress is not going to be automatic. It has been hard work winning export markets and rebuilding confidence that sees investment at such high levels. There is a real danger that people will think that because the economy is growing at very healthy rates, suddenly we are back to where we were in 2008, but that misses the point, dramatically and in many ways. Deputy Eamon Ryan touched on this. We have a had a decade of lost investment. Had we been able to sustain the levels of public investment at between 4% and 5% of GDP we would have had nearly €15 billion more invested in the hardware of public services such as the transport system. We are now seeing a recovery in investment which is very welcome, but the notion that this recovery can now be cashed in and paid out, in extra pay and other things, misses the point. Three quarters of the new growth has come from investment in the past two years. In the stability update, healthy growth is forecast for the next two years and nearly three quarters of the new growth will come from investment, but these investments are the seed potatoes of the future. They are not to be consumed now as if they were disposable income. We are trying to fill a lost decade and create the framework and necessary underpinning to continue to create jobs. It is really important to understand this. We will try to create the drivers of long-term sustainable growth, on the back of which we will be able to build in line with the ambitions we all share. The work I am doing is to make sure every person can find a job here. Getting back to full employment is a hugely important vision, on the back of which not only will we restore dignity to 200,000 people and give them a chance to create a home of their own and have stability in their lives and a stable outlook on the world, but we will also create the resources to invest in the services that were sadly lost in the decade that has passed. We need to create a virtuous circle, as described by the Competitiveness Council. The achievements of the public and private sectors in the past couple of years are reflected in the fantastic work being done with diminishing resources in the public sector and the fantastic work being done in the private sector, especially in the new technologies and research and development in food and other things. There is a virtuous circle if we can build on these new achievements to deliver higher living standards for everyone, with more resources for public services and more jobs, but if one tries to do it in reverse by starting with spending the fruits of the money and paying ourselves more before we deliver the new achievements, sadly the virtuous circle will go into reverse. This is one of the things we learned from the crisis - in the economy which was built in 2000-07, 66% of new jobs were in the construction sector and public services and we were attempting to build and spend our way to economic progress. This time around 45% has come from exports, compared with only 1% of jobs from new export markets back then. We have a much more balanced economy and can look to the future with a great deal of confidence on the basis of where we now stand, but we need to make sure we continue to build the virtuous circle by achieving the new output in both the public and private sectors on which we will be able to build. I have been in this House a long time and seen two occasions on which there were opportunities. The first was when we joined the European Union when there was a great opportunity to leap forward, but policymakers made the wrong decisions to go for a public spending approach to the economy, leading to a dramatic crash in the 1980s. The second was after we had joined the eurozone when the very same phenomenon occurred, namely, cheap money in the economy. This led both the public and private sectors to decide they could borrow that money and spend to build living standards without the underpinning of a strong economy. These visions came crashing down on both occasions, with huge destruction of people's livelihoods and prospects and huge emigration followed. It is important that we understand the resources we need to build a better housing system, a better mental health system or better health services and so on have not yet been created. People talk about fiscal space. It is about running two things in tandem, namely, creating the strong economy that can deliver resources and investing well in mental health, education and health services. We have to keep these two horses together, in harness, as they are two sides of the same coin. I heard Deputy Seamus Healy trot out the same stuff we have heard so many times before to the effect that, in some way, the European Union owes us by writing off our debt and that if only we tapped into 1% of the population, everything would be solved.

Anyone who has gone out to work to make a living knows that no one owes him or her a living. One must create the opportunity. We have set out our ambitions for full employment, a housing sector that can provide an affordable home for everyone and fair access to health and education services. We can do this, but we can only do it on the basis of our economic success and ability to win new markets and produce goods people want to buy. On the back of this we can build the society we want to create. No one owes us a living and we must do these things through the ingenuity of the people.

The context of the debate is the general election in which it was very clear there that was zero connection between the vast majority of the people of the country and the macroeconomic figures laid out in the document which is about to be submitted to the Commission in Brussels. The daily lives of families, small businesses, farmers and communities, both in this city and rural areas, are utterly disconnected from the fairy book story laid out in the document before us. This Dáil needs to commit itself collectively to ensuring the disconnect and alienation among communities, families and small businesses from these macroeconomic figures is dealt with. Otherwise, it will completely fail in its mandate, whatever side one is on in the economy. In the context of the deal to form a Government, I will express a personal concern. There is a lot of speculation that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is about to be re-merged with the Department of Finance. I strongly caution against this. The focus on expenditure, and particularly public service reform, will not be served by bringing it back into the Department of Finance, a Department that wants to control everything and justify nothing and which has a tradition and culture of secrecy, as we have seen here today, as well as of exercising utter control and showing a lack of a connection with real problems. Second, we have had a debate on health and the many areas in which considerable resources are being invested. There is a need for more resources, but there is also a need to examine how resources are being spent. I believe taking public service reform away from its parent Department and returning it to the Department of Finance, perhaps under the control of a Minister of State, will not work. I was that Minister of State at one time. It will not work unless it is connected to a senior Cabinet Minister and there is some comprehension on the part of the parent Department of the need for the investment of resources and to see where they are going. While I have huge respect for the acting Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, I believe he has not heard the message from the electorate on the disconnect between the previous Government and what is happening in people's daily lives. Yes, it is fine to send these flash documents to Brussels. However, people are not seeking pay rises. They seek fairness. They want to know that if they go to an emergency department, they will not have to remain there for 36 hours waiting for a trolley and that if they require surgery, they will not have to wait two years for it. They want to know that they will be treated with fairness, equality and respect in the many public services available. That is the greatest risk and it is not outlined in the document. Because of where it is being sent, it will not outline that the societal risks of this pursuit of the economic model being pushed on us by the ECB are greater than any economic risk. I have said it previously and will repeat it now that the European Commission is failing completely in its remit. It has handed over any sense of a social obligation to the ECB. It is time that all those of us who care about the European Union and the European project and who value what it has done brought the Commission back to representing and standing up for the people of the Union. With regard to the risks involved, many Deputies have spoken about the need for increased capital expenditure. That is agreed across the parties. We need houses and greater investment in infrastructure because we need both the infrastructure and the employment potential it creates. Along with it we must also start to invest immediately in human infrastructure. There is no sense in outlining and agreeing a housing and infrastructure investment programme when we are gutting the apprenticeship expenditure programme. We will scramble again, as happened in the early 2000s, to find people to fill roles and jobs if we ignore the talent available by ignoring young apprentices. We also must re-imagine apprentices and bring people with those talents who are older and might not normally be the target of an apprenticeship programme into it to use their old talents and give them the chance to refresh. Unless we provide or redirect funding and resources into an education system focused on apprenticeships and training for skills, we will not get value for money when rolling out housing and infrastructure programmes because we will be scrambling for labour to build them. That is the first thing that must be done in terms of an apprenticeship programme. We must have a proper internship scheme. I refer to the revelations in the Sunday Business Post last weekend about the JobBridge programme. Many Deputies have been speaking about this issue for some time and I acknowledge the work the former Senator and now Deputy David Cullinane has done on it. Last weekend the JobBridge programme was exposed for what it was, but an internship scheme can be good. One can gain good experience if employers are willing to deal with it properly. We must examine the cohort of people who are long-term unemployed and give them the skills they need to take part in the recovery. Again, there is a disconnect between the fiscal figures and getting the long-term unemployed, particularly those who are older, back into some role with their skills, life skills and life experiences in terms of a recovery that means something to them and their families. With regard to communities and small businesses, there is a focus on exports, with which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, continued. That is good and we have good infrastructure in place. However, we are still not joining the dots for small businesses in services and retail that are continuing to struggle. Yes, the service industry is thriving in Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6 and the city centre, but when one leaves those confines, it becomes progressively weaker. It is still not strong because money is still not in people's pockets and there is no confidence. We cannot ignore the 300,000 people who are working in the retail industry. We are struggling to get our heads around providing a future for them in the face of competition on the Internet. In ignoring the retail industry we are ignoring the future of small communities in cities and rural areas. If there are to be vibrant communities, be they in the villages of this city or in rural areas, there must be a retail sector that thrives and has a role. We must provide support to ensure the retail sector has a future because that is a threat to community stability as we continue to struggle with providing a future for communities. Again, it is not a threat in the view of the European Central Bank, but it should be in terms of the long-term threat to the country. What is not included in the document is very important. Several Deputies have referred to the health system, including the mental health system, housing issues and the collapse in communities. That is what we must include in the document. That is how a proper document would look in the context of outlining the stability of a nation as opposed to the stability of the books. The stability of a nation is much more important and it is more fundamentally our role as legislators. That is also the message the electorate gave us at the end of February. A macro recovery that means nothing to people in their homes, communities, businesses and farms is nothing unless it comes with societal responsibility and is felt in these homes, businesses and farms. While people are struggling to access basic health, mental health and education services in so many facilities, they will not be happy with a recovery or the notion of a macroeconomic vision that ignores the reality of their lives.

I am sorry that the acting Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has left the Chamber. I listened with a sense of frustration to his assertion that nobody in the Chamber had a monopoly of compassion. Whatever he might have meant by that comment, it translates to an assumption that we are here to serve the interests of citizens not on the basis of equality, justice, decency or rights but on the basis on compassion. I represent a working class community and, frankly, they do not want the compassion of the acting Minister, the members of Fine Gael or any other Member elected to this House. What they want is a fair chance and to live in a decent society. They do not believe, as the acting Minister asserted, that anybody owes them a living. That is the most common slur cast against the working class in society, people who have stumbled on hard times and who rely on decent thresholds of social decency in society - the assertion that they believe somebody owes them a living. What we owe ourselves and each other is to be honest. We owe it to the citizens of the State to be straight with them and we owe it ourselves and the generations to come to construct not just a dynamic economy that benefits those at the top but also a fair and sustainable economy that benefits all of us in terms of access to decent work, not JobBridge schemes, and decent services and, finally, to address the appalling vista of all of the usual things to which the acting Minister referred. He appeared to take umbrage at Deputy Seamus Healy and said he was trotting out the same old things. I am sorry if it bores him, if the facts of life bore him or if repetition of the fact that almost 90,000 families are in mortgage arrears is dull.There is also the fact that 1.3 million of our people experience deprivation and that in this jurisdiction, supposedly the fastest growing economy in Europe, we now have the third highest deprivation rate, at 25%, for children age nought to six years. I am sorry if this is dull and if it irritates elements in the Chamber because people keep presenting the nuisance of repeating these things but they are worthy of repetition because this is what is happening. Shiny documents aside, if any government or administration cannot face up to these challenges and admit to them or address them, then all of the shiny documents in the world are not worth the paper on which they are written. The fact the shiny document, it seems, is not amenable to amendment from those of us on the opposition benches tells its own story and raises a not surprising question mark in respect of any real commitment to Dáil reform but I am not hugely surprised by this. Earlier, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, referred to young Irish women between the ages of 15 and 19, who have the highest rate of suicide in the European Union. We can add to this young Irish men between the same ages, who have the second highest rate of suicide in the European Union. If one wishes a measure of where we are at, this is it. The great tragedy and difficulty is that with the active assistance of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and others, the State has been signed up to a fiscal regime and fiscal rules which act, effectively, as a straitjacket in respect of the spending decisions we can make. I am not talking about wild irresponsible spending that may have been characteristic of other parties in the past. I am speaking about responsible economic and social investment. We have the shiny document. We have had it for only a short while and, of course, the length of time to debate it is entirely inadequate. I want the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his colleagues to know their compassion is not what is required. What is required is their cop-on, decency and understanding that people have rights and are not reliant on the compassion of their hearts.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	167	There is no doubt a recovery is under way. We all accept this. There is no doubt the public finances are better now than they were two, five or even ten years ago. There is no doubt the fiscal space, on which we can have disagreements, means we will have approximately €10 billion extra to spend over the next five years depending on what we want do with it. I do not dispute the figures in the spring forecast and stability programme update presented to us but the reality is all of these figures must be put in the context of Fine Gael's taxation and budgetary policies and the policies of Fianna Fáil, which in my view are very similar. They put forward very similar fiscal policies in the election. The figures in the budgetary plans on page 44 of the document, referred to by Deputy Pearse Doherty earlier, on the total revenue spend as a percentage of GDP and the total expenditure spend as a percentage of GDP really expose the fact that the low tax, low spend policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will continue for the next five years. The revenue spend as a percentage of GDP will reduce by 3% and the expenditure spend as a percentage of GDP will be cut by 8.5%. This does not mean we have much scope to be able to deal with the housing crisis, the health crisis and the real levels of poverty and all of the inequalities we have in this State. Let us look at the report we received, as shiny as it is, at all of the statistics and figures in it - the Minister will sell, in a very positive way, some of these figures - and juxtapose the report with, for example, the report from a voluntary housing association published two weeks ago, which showed record levels of homelessness throughout the State, and the UNICEF report published last week, which showed one in five children in the State goes without basic needs, and measure the report against the Irish Cancer Society's report published this week, which laid bare the real inequalities we have in health care in the State where public patients wait in some cases 25 times longer than private patients, and against the OECD's report on low pay published last year, which showed that one in five workers in the State is in a low paid job with many suffering from deprivation, and the EUROSTAT report published last year, which showed record levels of income inequality in the State. This is the reality of the policies that have been pursued by the party of the Minister of State and by Fianna Fáil. The consequence and outworking of these policies mean children go hungry, families end up in mortgage distress, children sleep in emergency accommodation, patients lie on hospital trolleys, older people do not get home help and families live in poverty, and all of this will get worse. I read the chapter in the update report on the labour market, which does not at all deal with the reality of emigration and the impact it has had on the unemployment figures. It does not at all deal with the massive issue of low pay and it does not deal with the so-called labour activation schemes and the impact they have on the figures. It is a very shallow assessment of the labour market and the real challenges in low pay we have in the State. It does not deal with many of the potential shocks and challenges that face the labour market in the State. We welcome the fact we will have changes on how budgets are formulated and the fact Fine Gael has stated it wants to hear the views of the Opposition, and we will bring forward our policies and views. However, we can have all the documents we want but the reality is that as we move into a new dispensation, if the budgetary plans in the document are delivered and we have a reduction in revenues and expenditures as a percentage of GDP, then how will we deal with the real catastrophe we have in housing and the challenges in health care, public spending and public services? We will not be able to do so. It was already remarked that we have one of the lowest capital spends in the entire European Union as a percentage of GDP but Fine Gael wants to reduce it so it can give more tax cuts to the wealthy and super wealthy in the State over and above ensuring that children, older people, sick people and those who need supports get them. This is the reality of the policies being pursued by the outgoing Government and, I would say, that will be pursued with the support of Fianna Fáil if some arrangement is concocted over the coming days.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	168	The stability programme update, SPU, document tells a positive story of remarkable change and of challenge which has yet to be overcome. In April 2011, shortly after the Labour Party entered government, that year's SPU told a grim story. It spoke of a critical need to try to get the public finances into some kind of order, of ensuring the sustainability of the Government's debt position, of hauling the banking sector back to health, of getting people back to work, of saving public servants from the type of redundancies they faced in other countries, which had seen the collapse of their banking systems, of the unparalleled collapse we had in the housing market and of the 330,000 people who lost their jobs. This was Fianna Fáil's equality and progressiveness, as all those who lost their jobs saw their income decrease. The income distribution among the people of the country became progressive because everybody's income was lower. People need to be careful and think it through when they speak about what is progressive and what is regressive. As grim as the forecasts were then, they proved to be overly optimistic, forecasting that unemployment would peak at about 14.5% when in fact it went above 15%. Similarly, the SPU in 2011 predicted overall Government debt would peak at 118%; it eventually hit 120%. In truth - and we must consider this honestly - the scale and depth of Ireland's crisis was worse than anybody could have accurately foreseen, yet we see just five years on, as the Government prepares to leave office, that the situation has been utterly transformed. The SPU shows that in 2015, the economy grew by 7.8%, the strongest performance in Europe by a very wide margin and well ahead of expectations. The number of people at work rose by more than 50,000. Shortly we will have 2 million people back at work. Unemployment has fallen below 9% for the first time since December 2008. Many people in this Chamber think unemployment does not matter at all, but it does matter. Many people trade in suggestions that unemployment is of no concern, but it is of huge concern to the families, individuals and communities affected by it. In 2015 and in each of the previous four years Ireland more than achieved its targets for the public finances. We have comfortably come below our debt and deficit reduction targets. With a headline deficit of 2.3% of GDP and an underlying deficit of 1.3%, we are comfortably below the 3% reference rate for an excessive deficit under the fiscal treaty. Therefore, for the first time since 2009, Ireland will be outside the excessive deficit procedure. The debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 93.8%, close to the European average, and is on a strong downward trajectory. Effectively, therefore, the 2016 SPU set out in unambiguous terms the rescue of the Irish economy and our public finances from a state close to bankruptcy five years ago, the very strong performance over the last 12 months and the transformation in the prospects of the country over the next five to ten years. None of this is to say that everything is rosy because it is not. Behind every new job is a person or a family benefiting from recovery in their own lives, but not everyone who wants a job has got a job yet. Unemployment has fallen significantly but has not fallen far enough, and the point of recovery for many individuals, families and communities is to see people back in the town, village, suburb or city, working and having financial independence, and working in jobs with good pay and conditions. I agree with what Deputy Calleary said about apprenticeship. It is one of the things I have spent a lot of time building into the social welfare structure. Starter apprenticeships and first steps onto the road of a job for some of our young people who, unfortunately, do not have the contacts - a dad, uncle or other relative - who can, as with the apprenticeships of old, walk them down to a workplace where they will get an apprenticeship. Apprenticeship, like everything else, has changed very significantly. The housing crisis will take time to work out but, in the meantime, thousands of families need practical, affordable interim solutions. The number of mortgage arrears, as was acknowledged earlier, has been steadily falling but that is no consolation to those families who remain in arrears and need more help. While great strides have been made in expanding the network of primary care centres, the health system as a whole, as we all know, remains under severe pressure. I am acutely conscious that on all these fronts and more the effects of the crisis are still being felt and that many people are still struggling to see recovery in their own lives and to see the hope that their children will get on a career path, whether that be college, an apprenticeship or whatever it is that the children want to do. What the 2016 SPU presents is the opportunity to build on the progress made to date, put sustainable solutions in place and help people to get to a better place in their lives. The outlook for the economy has improved since budget day and the public finances are again projected to beat targets, but we do have very significant issues in Ireland, the European Union and the globalised economy. We now live in a globalised economic space. One of the reasons that Ireland has done well is that foreign direct investment never faltered during the most difficult years because it was not financed out of local banks in the Irish economy. However, we have seen, for instance, the revelations in recent weeks contained in the Panama papers of two distinct but related problems: a global web of interlinked legal and financial firms that facilitate illegality, which is a matter for the relevant policing authorities to pursue; and the support by this web of interconnected services of legal but morally dubious tax planning that allows firms and wealthy individuals to minimise their tax liabilities at the expense of national exchequers and citizens. Much of this aggressive tax planning is carried out in secret behind the shield of the kind of paper companies identified in the Panama papers leaks. Such tax planning is an international issue that requires a co-ordinated international response because, through such a response, all national exchequers would benefit. I persuaded Deputy Calleary's late colleague, the former Minister, Brian Lenihan Jnr., to introduce minimum effective income tax rates. As I have said before, we do not yet have the same regime in effect for corporates so we need to ensure that tax avoidance by very wealthy individuals and firms is both mitigated and minimised. There has been a lot of talk this morning of fairness, but the core of fairness in a democratic system is that people contribute in a fair way their share of tax, no more and no less, and every citizen should pay his or her fair share of tax. Ensuring such an outcome would boost our tax revenues even further in the years ahead. We have as well within the SPU the prospect of a significant surplus over the next five years. These are very strong figures, but the opportunities they offer have to be realised. We must recognise that the projections in the SPU and the additional resources are contingent on the growth assumptions underlying them. Therefore, given the risks the Irish economy faces, these assumptions cannot be taken for granted. If the recovery falters, there will be a corresponding reduction in the resources available. One very significant risk that we have already discussed this week is the prospect of Brexit, which, if it were to materialise, would likely be very damaging to our economy. Another risk is instability at home. While our ability to influence external risks is limited, to say the least, we have the power to mitigate the risk of political instability. It is therefore imperative that a new Government is put in place as soon as possible to guard against the risks on the horizon and, I hope, maximise the opportunity ahead of us as a country.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	169	The SPU outlines what we will tell the European institutions about the state of play in this country and what the risks are and how we will frame our budgets within the parameters that are permitted. However, I do not believe that we are giving them an accurate picture, and we can hardly expect them to understand the impact European policies are having in the country if we do not give them an accurate picture.After all, Ireland is the country that picked up in excess of 40% of the European banking collapse and dominates in terms of its ability to borrow. We also have a distinctive characteristic in regard to GDP as opposed to GNP which to a degree distorts the extent of our debt ratio. Our debt-to-GNP ratio would be far worse. For example, much as multinational companies are an important feature in the Irish economy, such companies are transient. Hopefully, some of them will stay a long time and provide good jobs, but one cannot ignore that such is the case. The risks to the economy is the area that I looked at in this document. The document, on page 26, describes the housing supply pressures. The likelihood is that it would be a high risk but, under impact and main transmission channel, it is seen as a medium risk. The document states that supply constraints in the housing sector might adversely impact on competitiveness by restricting the mobility of labour. It has far more of an impact than that and we are significantly understating the problem. The housing supply pressures, which most of us have been describing as a crisis for a considerable period, could not be described as medium risk. These must be high risk. There are over 100,000 applicants on the housing waiting list and if one averages those out as three persons per application, as there will be single households and households with multiple members, it would amount to approximately 15% of the population. It is a significant number. Housing and homelessness is a serious problem with 1,800 children in this city alone living in emergency accommodation, and that is where one can count the figures. In other parts of the country, including County Kildare, they are not as easy to count where applicants are more likely to be told to self-accommodate, which means bunking up with family, possibly with a whole family living in a small bedroom. It is still an emergency environment and there is a price to pay for that family in the future. The business sector, including multinational companies, highlights the lack of affordable accommodation as an impediment to recruitment. The cost of accommodation is a key factor in the cost of living. It is decreasing people's ability to spend in the domestic economy and it is understandably driving up wage demands. This document needs to be amended to accommodate the real risk here, which is not a medium risk. It is now a high risk. The Government should not understate the problem because if it does, then we will not be in a position to look for solutions. The fiscal rules limit the scope to borrow on balance sheet and yet that is precisely what we need to do if we are to invest in the housing stock and achieve a more stable housing sector. If we keep saying that everything is grand when it is not, all we will continue to get is a collective pat on the head. Some other areas are not stated as well as they should be, for example, the area of congestion and our climate commitments. Congestion and our ability to deal with it because of our low levels of capital investment is a critical issue, yet it is not identified as a risk. According to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, 57% of Dublin companies state traffic congestion is having an increased impact on their business. IBEC, not a body I would be seen to rush to quote, makes valid points. In IBEC's view, the overall capital plan is not nearly as ambitious as it ought to be. It hopes that the next Government will have an opportunity to put this right in the medium-term review in early 2017 by acting on the recommendations for the remaining years of the plan, that it should deliver additional high-quality jobs in Irish business and industry, more reliable convenient public transport and reduce congestion, with a consequent improvement on the quality of life for citizens. Why is this not being highlighted? I remember us getting a large amount of funding transferred on the basis of the negative impact of congestion. Those were European funds spent here to acknowledge it. Luas, for example, was one of the projects that happened as a consequence. It has a much bigger impact in the Dublin region because it affects the outer counties and it is the main driver of the economy in the absence of more balanced regional development. If one starts looking at that in the context of fulfilling Ireland's climate obligations, there is a real risk of us having to pay out hard cash in large quantities in three sectors, the first of which is transport. We need to invest, for example, in something like the interconnector which will connect up our rail lines and deliver a public transport system that has a benefit in both directions. Such a system will cost a great deal but that is an investment that must be seen in a long-term context. If we do not so invest we are likely to spend as much on fines in the future than we will on the infrastructure. Of the three main sectors in terms of climate, another big sector would be the built environment. Not only should we build sustainable houses in the future but if we are to avoid an oil shock in the future, we must reduce the amount of fossil fuels used in existing buildings by retrofitting them. Essentially, that is an investment for the future. Agriculture is probably our biggest challenge in that regard because of the importance of both the food and agriculture sectors, and we await to see what the sectoral plans have to say on that. However, the level of ambition that has been stated so far pales into insignificance and already we are destined to miss our targets by 2020. We will only fall further back if we do not reach those targets. We must put that in as a real risk. The other big area inhibiting the ability of people to go to work, in terms of the cost of living and competitiveness, is that we have the most expensive child care system in Europe. It is a Hobson's choice for parents in terms of the costs involved in going to work. Often low-income families find it impossible to juggle that. One cannot but see the lack of investment in these systems, which should be public systems, in the context of a risk because they impact on the economy, on the ability of parents to function and on the cost of living. They are real risks from an economic point of view. Earlier Deputy Eamon Ryan asked how does one make amendments to the document by virtue of the fact that we are having this debate today. It is like, as former Deputy Joe Higgins stated, playing handball against a haystack. That is what is coming back. Essentially, we all recognise there has been protracted delay in a government being formed and in the Dáil functioning as it would normally, but there were actions that could have been taken by way of providing an update, a channel for input and then debate to reinforce that. That was not offered and it was a major missed opportunity in terms of the tone of this Dáil. The Government is giving the European institutions a document that is inadequate. If the document is not completely stating the picture it must be asked if it is a work of fact or a work of fiction.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	170	I am pleased to speak on these statements on the draft stability programme update, which includes the Department of Finance's spring forecasts, for April 2016. I had a look through the document and it includes many interesting figures which I want to highlight.I always compare the document with the one produced the previous year to see how it stands up. If what was proposed this time last year was substantially the situation on budget day, it was a useful document. If it was wide of the mark, its use was very limited and it was probably unhelpful to political discourse. The document refers to the fiscal space. Last year's document referred to a fiscal space of €1.3 billion or €1.4 billion. I forget the figure because I have not checked my notes from 12 months ago. All summer, for six months, the debate raged on how we would divide the fiscal space between tax and expenditure. Fianna Fáil argued for fairness, as we did all along in our responses to the Budget Statements over the past three years, because the Fine Gael Government always wanted to give more money in tax cuts to higher earners and cut expenditure on front-line services. This is the hallmark of Fine Gael. It took much debate to get Fine Gael to accept a 50:50 split between expenditure and taxation. In the recent election, most parties were of the opinion that we needed more in expenditure for front-line services compared with tax cuts for the wealthy. Last week, I spoke to junior certificate students at the CBS in Portlaoise. There were approximately 30 students in the classroom, aged approximately 15 years. We got into a discussion about the national finances and they asked what happens in the Dáil. I explained that one of the most significant decisions we make in the Dáil is how much of the fiscal space available goes on tax cuts and how much on public expenditure. I told them this issue was the essential difference between the parties in the Dáil and I asked for a show of hands on whether they favoured tax cuts so people had more money to spend and less for front-line services, such as health and education, or more for front-line services and a little less in tax cuts. The people in the group were very clever and intelligent and the vote was three or four to one in favour of expenditure on front-line services. They see in their daily lives the troubles their parents have making ends meet, the difficulty of the cost of education, especially if somebody is going on to third level education, and dealing with the health service where 500,000 people await a routine appointment before they get on a list for treatment. They understood it. A small minority in the class favoured tax cuts and thought people who had worked hard and earned money should keep more of it. This minority point of view prevails among a certain group of people and while I do not agree with it, it is a valid point of view. It is interesting that the next generation can see the issue of social justice. They agreed on how the split in the fiscal space should be spent. The document we received this time last year referred to a fiscal space of €1.4 billion or €1.5 billion. Although it may have been right at the time, it was wrong when it came to budget day. The weekend before the budget last year, the Government marched into the House and announced Supplementary Estimates of €1.6 billion. The week before the 2016 budget, there was a fiscal space of over €3 billion, comprising the Supplementary Estimates of €1.6 billion and the €1.4 billion the Government found on budget day. In last year's spring statement, the Government had underestimated the fiscal space on budget day by 50%. While the Government had estimated a fiscal space of €1.4 billion, we had a fiscal space of €3 billion a week before the budget. More than half of it went on a Supplementary Estimate, given that we could not upset the ratios we were dealing with as part of the fiscal treaty, which I understand. My only question is how wrong these figures are in terms of the fiscal space that will be available next September. It will be all the more important, given that last year, the information could be kept internally among a few officials and a Minister in the Department of Finance. I do not know if it was shared with the full Government. While the EMC and maybe four people in the House knew about it, nobody else knew. Will we have a new budgetary process in September and October in advance of the budget dealing with these issues? This is not the basis of a document that can be part of the process next September. Last year's document was woefully off the mark last September and this will need to be revised next September when we begin our budget debate a month before the budget, or whenever, that we are basing it on the actual situation, not on something that is six months old. There will be policy changes in the meantime and the document will have to be updated in terms of new policy initiatives that are not included and a more up to date estimate of the financial position. Last year, we had an unexplained bonanza due to corporation tax and there was much talk about it internationally. Some companies are probably trying to put their best foot forward and make an increased contribution to corporation tax to ensure they do not look like they are not paying a certain amount. This is the most important single issue. While this document is useful for today, it will be no use when we discuss the budget here next September. We will need a substantial document. Those who are producing it will have to go through it with the Oireachtas committee. The rules have changed regarding Supplementary Estimates and if there is a shortfall in the Department, it can raise funds elsewhere or obtain them from another Department. This will have a significant influence next September in the run up to next year's budget. We will need all those figures available in public at an Oireachtas committee, not to be announced as a surprise on budget day. It will be useful. While the document we have is a useful set of statistics, it will not be the basis of a discussion on the budget next autumn. The document mentions threats from external influences extensively and we will have a better read on it in autumn. I refer to table 11 on page 17 - Budgetary outturn 2015 and projections 2016-2021. It shows that the current budget balance - current revenue minus current expenditure not including national debt and interest payments - will be in surplus this year, which is good. In 2018, we will have a positive Government balance as a percentage of GDP as long as the economy holds up, which is welcome. The national debt is expected to continue at the same level. According to Table 12 on page 19, the gross debt was €201 billion at the end of last year and is expected to be €201 billion at the end of 2021. Although the national debt will not be reduced by a single penny, the figures will look good because the percentage of national debt will have decreased solely on the basis of increasing GNP. Table A2.2 on page 41 is General Government budgetary forecasts 2015-2021. Item D.41 on this table is interest expenditure, primarily on the national debt. We will pay €6.3 billion this year, €6.3 billion next year, €6.1 billion in 2018, €6 billion in 2019, €5.8 billion in 2020 and €5.4 billion in 2021. While we talk much in the Chamber about a €12 million budget moving from one area to another, we have never had a debate about interest on the national debt in my years here. We do not discuss the non-voted expenditure account. It is wrong. Approximately €10 billion goes through the account, including EU transfers. While some of the matters are contractually entered into and cannot be changed, it is wrong that there is not a debate in the Chamber every year on the interest on the national debt. We will come in and talk for two days on €12 million in the mental health budget but there is no talk about the interest and expenditure on the national debt. Although it cannot go away, the nation would benefit from an open debate on the issue to see if there is any way it can be reduced. It is important that we examine it. The total expenditure for this year noted in the chart is €73.8 billion, minus the €6 billion national debt. It will allow expenditure of €67 billion on other items and this increases at a maximum rate of less than €1 billion per annum over the lifetime.I look forward to seeing an updated and revised document based on new policy positions next September as well as up to date estimates and projections of Government receipts and expenditure, so that we will have a useful document to discuss at that time in advance of the budget.

While stability programme updates are a relatively new phenomenon, the reality is they are a legacy of the crash. This positive policy measure is designed to keep a closer grasp on our finances and thereby avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. It is about keeping a check on our progress. The stability programme update is also an important element of the new Europe-wide budgetary processes that have become the norm and, in my view, are in the best interests of taxpayers. As this report outlines, we are expecting economic growth of almost 5% this year. Our economic landscape has changed utterly over the last five or six years. In 2010, before I entered national politics, I worked as a manager in the local credit union in Cootehill. I remember I felt sick to the pit of my stomach the day it was announced that Ireland was entering a bailout and the troika was coming. I was very worried about the fate of this country and the future of young people, the local area and the local town. This worrying and terrible time was filled with huge uncertainty. We can all remember trying to get our heads around the jaw-dropping figures that were mentioned at the time. It was estimated that Ireland needed €85 billion in international loans to keep our hospitals open, our schools running and our public servants paid. It was not much longer than five years ago. We can all remember the harsh cuts that were implemented over a number of years to bring the public finances back under control. Indeed, I am sure we can all remember the speculation that a second bailout would be needed in late 2012. Instead, we successfully exited the bailout at the end of 2013. We can all remember those difficult years. As we look ahead to what will be a third year of record growth, we must not forget those difficult years or take our renewed economic prosperity for granted. We cannot assume that growth will continue regardless of policy. One of the flaws of the recent general election campaign was that it was based in part on a phoney war about how the main parties and others would spend the spoils of the economic recovery in the years ahead. That argument missed the point that there will be no money if we squander our hard-fought economic progress. I do not want to see the sacrifices of the Irish people squandered and our progress unravelled. Perhaps the most important line in this stability programme update is "While the central scenario for economic activity in Ireland over the next 18 months or so is a reasonably benign one, internationally the level of uncertainty is higher than at any stage since the height of the financial crisis." It is more important than ever, therefore, to continue the approach that has been taken over recent years. This approach is based on sustaining a jobs-led recovery that is underpinned by a focus on enterprise and innovation. It is important to note that the economic and fiscal forecasts set out in this economic update are prepared on a technical, no policy change basis. Therefore, if we want to achieve the impressive growth rates that have been set out in this document, the economic policies that have been implemented by the outgoing Government must be implemented. Job creation has been and will continue to be a top priority for Fine Gael. Some 138,000 jobs have been created since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2012. It is expected that a further 50,000 jobs will be added to the economy this year. In my own county of Monaghan, for example, unemployment rates have fallen by approximately one third. Young people are returning home and new businesses are opening. The Department of Finance expects employment to move above the 2 million mark this year for the first time since early 2009. Crucially, employment is now more balanced than before, with employment growth across a wide range of sectors rather than an over-reliance on the construction sector. The employment rate is set to average 8.4% and should be close to 8% by the end of the year. Fine Gael will continue its relentless focus on job creation to ensure everyone has a chance to access employment. To date, we have published plans on entrepreneurship, innovation, skills, foreign direct investment strategies and regional plans for each of the eight regions in the country. Most Deputies will agree that we need to continue with this targeted approach if we are to spread job growth in every region throughout the country. I would like to speak briefly about how the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has benefited from the economic recovery. When I entered the Department in July 2014, the era of cuts had just come to an end. The arts and heritage sectors suffered considerably during the economic downturn. Budgets were significantly reduced across the Arts Council and other cultural institutions. As a consequence of the turnaround in our public finances, I have been in a position to increase budgets over the past two years. It has also been possible to invest significantly in the centenary commemorations and thereby deliver a broad and extensive programme of inclusive and respectful events right across the country. Most of the money being spent on the commemorations is being used to create, at a number of historically important locations, a series of permanent reminders, new visitor centres, facilities and immersive attractions which will be used for generations to come. Just yesterday, I attended the launch of the new military archives building at Cathal Brugha Barracks with the President. This magnificent new facility provides a modern home for the military archives for the first time. We are also investing in our cultural institutions, with ambitious plans for the years ahead. A major €30 million project at the National Gallery is nearing its final phase. Work on an €8 million expansion project at the National Archives will get under way later this year. I am very excited about the planned upgrading works at the National Library beside Leinster House on Kildare Street. I know Deputy Catherine Murphy is very interested in that project. I was delighted to announce last year that we will be investing €10 million in the library's historic building, which has suffered from underinvestment for decades. If economic stability is maintained, I hope further increased investment will be possible at the National Library and our other cultural institutions in the years ahead. I hope the new Government will continue to focus on the film industry as a very important one. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced yesterday that the increased cap on the section 481 film tax credit will come into effect from 1 May next. This change will help to attract further big-budget productions to Ireland. Having a stable and strong economy will allow us to address the challenges we face, not only in my own Department but also in areas like homelessness, housing and health. We cannot create a fair and just society unless we have a strong economy. We have made significant inroads into repairing the public finances. In 2011, the deficit was 12.6% of GDP. This year, it will be 1.1% of GDP. As this stability programme update outlines, we must remain very conscious of the numerous risks and the large degree of uncertainty that exists internationally, including the upcoming referendum in the UK on its membership of the EU. The best way to deal with this uncertainty is to keep our house in order. Just as we are dealing with the new economic landscape that has developed in recent years, we are facing a new political landscape. Our over-riding priority must be to maintain stability. There is an onus on every Member of this Dáil to support policies that will safeguard the economic progress that has been made and spread the fruits of prosperity. Some Deputies are best at shouting about this country's problems. They stir up emotions without providing any solutions. If we do not continue to engage in responsible management of the public finances and pursue competitiveness-oriented policies that help us to compete in an increasingly globalised world economy, we will not be acting in the best interests of the Irish people.

I know the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, mentioned that such surveillance is a good thing but I think it is a good thing when the democratic wishes of the people are fully reflected in economic policies rather than being qualified by eurocrats and other unaccountable people who are neither aligned to our economic interests nor accountable to the Irish people.This process is worse. Owing to the eternal Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil negotiations the stability programme update has been directed by Ministers without a mandate and written by faceless civil servants to the expectations and demands of unelected eurocrats.  The Taoiseach said earlier that in terms of what is provided for in this document it is a case of business as usual; no change, which is a far cry from the Government using last year's document as a publicity exercise with regard to the spring statement. It was like a press statement on steroids in advance of the general election, the purpose of which was to put the Government into good light before it had to go before the people. Unfortunately, it became a damp squib at the time.  For me one of the most significant issues not debated in this Chamber but debated among people in academia is the fact that we are dealing with measurements that are inaccurate. The saying "You can't manage if you can't measure" comes to mind. There is broad agreement outside of this Chamber that Irish GDP levels are not reflective of economic output and that there are huge distortions in the economy with regard to income flows to non-residents, particularly profits, and dividends to foreign direct investment enterprises. GNP is also suffering. GNP is understood to be a better measurement of the income of the State and has in recent times been about 20% less than GDP. However, there is a distortion arising in that particular metric as well due to the trend of large American companies to headquarter in Ireland for tax reasons. A further distortion in the figures arises out of foreign firms booking foreign manufacturing in Ireland for tax avoidance purposes, in other words, contracts manufacturing. Michael Hennigan of Finfacts, who has done a good bit of work on this, believes that of the estimated €250 billion worth of export value for 2015, half of it is fake, with €60 billion related to the double Irish tax dodge used by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Oracle, etc. and the remainder coming from contracts manufacturing. These are not theoretic distortions. They are significant and real distortions which muddy our ability to properly measure and analyse the development of our economy and create major problems with regard to many other metrics that we use. The issue of the debt to GDP ratio is often discussed. If GDP is an inaccurate measurement of the economy then our debt to GDP ratio is inaccurate. We also discuss the level of investment in education with regard to GDP, which, too, is inaccurate, as is our level of health service provision and taxation with regard to GDP. The whole process of economic debate in this State is in itself distorted due to the fact that we do not have the necessary measurements. Last year, the finance committee, of which I was a member, discussed the issue of corporation taxes and the reason they were so far ahead of profile. I asked the chief economist of the Department of Finance to explain the reason for this and while he gave a few peripheral reasons as to why that could be the case it was obvious the Department of Finance did not fully understand why corporation taxes were so ahead of profile at that time. It is shocking that we do not have the tools in this State to properly measure the economy and, therefore, properly take the policy decisions that would derive from those measurements. This is not just a theoretical or statistical distortion. The economy is distorted. There is no doubt but that there is a massive over-dependence with regard to exports towards foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment maintains the bulk of our exports in this State. This leaves us fiercely exposed to external shocks, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and oil prices and are not matters within our control. The election of Donald Trump as the President of the USA would have an adverse shock on Ireland's economy. There is also a huge imbalance or distortion with regard to the size of Irish businesses and enterprises. In comparison with the Danish and Austrian economies Ireland has a small cohort of large to medium-sized enterprises. We also have a small cohort of indigenous businesses that export. This causes major problems. It is estimated that of the €250 billion of exports only €30 billion comes from internal exports. This leaves the Irish economy and jobs massively exposed to shocks. One of the first responsibilities of the incoming Government is to ensure that these issues are resolved such that we do not have an imbalanced economy, as we did a few years ago.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	173	I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss the stability programme update. I thank Deputies from all sides who contributed to the debate. I would like first to address Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's concern in regard to a point made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. I will attempt to reiterate the point he was making, which is an important one, namely, that nobody in this House has a monopoly of concern for the well-being of the Irish people. There is much talk about new politics. The best way to approach new politics would be for each of us to accept each other's bona fides. Everybody in this House wants to see our housing crisis tackled, people to have jobs, mortgage arrears to be tackled and the benefits of economic recovery shared. We will debate vociferously and rigorously in terms of how best to do that, which is the point the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was making. It is a point we should all accept as we embark on the Thirty-second Dáil. It is important to acknowledge and accept what this stability programme update is and is not. It is a technical document which we are legally required to submit to Europe. When we were a programme country we were not required to submit it so the fact that we are submitting it is a sign of the economic progress that Ireland is making. This document is not a budget or a spring economic statement, which are matters for the incoming Government. I echo the comments of the Tánaiste and others that the incoming Government will be put in place shortly so that we can put in place the policy measures that Deputies have rightly referred to as policy measures one would expect to see in a spring economic statement and a budget. Policy matters and we need to get into the meat of those discussions. The data provided in this stability programme update show the great economic progress that has been made. There is a recognition from all sides that such progress has been made. The challenge for the incoming Government and the Thirty-Second Dáil is to make that recovery felt in every home and community in every part of the country. The message which I picked up on the doorsteps during the general election campaign, which message I am sure other Members also picked up, is that people realise there is an economic recovery but they need to feel it in their lives. That is our collective challenge, and a particular challenge for the incoming Government. My colleagues, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, spoke earlier about the statistics in this document. They are not the Government's statistics, they are the facts. This is not how we tell our story to the world, as some asserted, this is the truth. These are the economic positions in which our country finds itself. The statistics provided are endorsed by the independent Fiscal Advisory Council. It is important to reiterate a point made by other Deputies, namely, economic recovery has not come about without significant sacrifice and pain on the part of the Irish people. Economic recovery was not easy. It hurt people and caused people pain. People had to make sacrifices. We do not need to be patted on the head by various economic institutions or European authorities and told we are great boys and girls. It was painful. The challenge now is to ensure the hard won fruits of the structural reforms of the outgoing Government, supported by the Irish people, are felt by every family. It is important to also acknowledge that the recovery has been job-rich. This is beginning to make a real impact on people's lives. We ensure economic recovery is felt by everybody through employment.We have seen an additional 140,000 people in work in Ireland since the launch of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative in early 2012. I hope the incoming Government will continue that mechanism of an action plan for jobs. In response to Deputy Dara Calleary's points, I hope the incoming Government will acknowledge the need to spread it to all parts of the country through the new regional Action Plan for Jobs. I take the point Deputy Peadar Tóibín made about corporation tax. I know that this is an issue he has raised and accept his bona fides on it. In a letter to the Minister for Finance published on the Department of Finance's website we have seen the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners acknowledge that it is not seen as cyclical but as sustainable. However, the Deputy is right. This House and any new committee need to monitor the position carefully. This will be a real test of new politics. "New politics" cannot just be buzzwords. It is going to move to choices and a new budget committee. It is going to involve Deputies debating how we want to spend the limited extra resources available to us. That is not what the SPU is about. It is about the facts. The next phase of the debate is about policy. That is a debate I hope we can get to very quickly. The final point I wish to make is that we are not balancing the books for the sake of it. Balancing the books is not something one does for the fun of it or to have a bit of craic. One balances the books to have resources in case there are external shocks such as Brexit or anything else in order to continue to provide services such as the State pension, for the minimum wage and the extra investment in services that we need. Balancing the books and being concerned about debt-to-GDP ratios are not issues that should be dismissed as something about which the Government and civil servants care. They matter to working class people, as Deputy Mary Lou McDonald likes to put it, and the people she wishes to represent.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	174	I thought I had seen it all, but if the media are reporting what I believe is probably accurate, we are heading back to the past. If that is the case, politics is failing. The issue of water charges has been a consistent blight on the political system for many years. We have to recognise that it has recently divided society because it followed a period of horrendous austerity during which taxpayers were lumbered unfairly with major bank debt, against which my party voted. I believe we are about to witness the triumph of mediocrity over modernism, of short-termism over common sense and of immaturity over innovation. If the scrapping of Irish Water goes ahead, let us call it what it is: political, economic and environmental sabotage. Let no one think we are in anyway experiencing new politics or that this is the birth of a new political maturity, if the current speculation is accurate. This is 1977 all over again. It is Groundhog Day. Unpopular local rates were abolished by Fianna Fáil and people paid income tax rates of up to 60% in the 1980s. We risk repeating that mistake. Every other EU country has some type of domestic charge for water. Fianna Fáil had the chance to make a stand on mental health services, the renewal of rural Ireland, to end child poverty or institute a living wage, yet it has made a stand on something that costs people €3 a week. What are its priorities?  Let us be clear on the decision that may be made shortly. A suspension or scrapping of water charges will result in the loss of billions of euro of potential investment in water services. I believe we will have water shortages in this very city in the near future. It is not only the amount of investment that matters but also investing in the right places at the right time and getting the balance right between new capital projects, upgrades and planned maintenance works. The aforementioned independent assessment and countless Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports pointed to the need not only to address an infrastructural deficit but also to improve the standards of operation. Given what I am hearing, if there is any fairness, the law-abiding people who could afford to pay and who have paid their bills will have to get their money back. That will mean that Irish Water will have to reprocess well in excess of 2 million financial transactions. I ask Deputies if that is common sense. Whether the charge is being suspended or abolished, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, Members of which are not even present, need to tell people how and when they will give them their money back. The loser in this is not any political party represented in this House but the environment and those who depend on a clean water supply. The 20,000 tonnes of sewage that pour into the lower harbour in Cork each day will continue to flow in the constituency of the Fianna Fáil leader; the boil water notices will continue and Dublin will not have a secure water supply into the future. What has Irish Water done to date? Its investment has delivered 34 new treatment plants, including 26 for wastewater and eight for drinking water, as well as 73 upgrades, including 51 for wastewater and 22 for drinking water. A further 47 water conservation projects have been completed, while 452 km of pipe has been remediated. Irish Water is also targeting investment to improve water quality. Look at the improvements it has made to the lives of 17,300 people in County Roscommon who were subject to boil water notices, with the residents of Castlerea, for example, being subject to boil water notices from November 2009 until two years ago. They can now turn on the tap without having to turn on the kettle first. Irish Water's implementation of disinfection technologies has meant 300,000 fewer people are now dependent on supplies in need of remedial action, as defined in the EPA's remedial action list. The urban areas with no wastewater treatment facilities are the focus of Irish Water, with the investment being aimed at protecting public health and the environment of the people living in these communities. Two of the required plants are complete and in operation, while another six are under construction. Critically, Irish Water is also addressing the unacceptably high level of leakages. Through metering identification of customer-led leakages, Irish Water has been able to offer households a first fix repair of leaks between the boundary of a property and a house. Through the repairs conducted by it under the scheme and those by customers of internal leaks identified through meters, 34 million litres of water have been saved. That is enough water saved every day to supply County Wicklow. Staff in Irish Water and their contractors must be reeling today, 500 of whom are based on the southside of Cork city in the backyard of the Fianna Fáil leader. I wonder what the 5,000 people who work in the water and waste industry think of the latest developments today. The Labour Party stands in solidarity with these workers. The funding model to modernise the water system is based on three components: subvention, commercial charges and domestic charges. To replace one of these, we will have to eat into the now famous fiscal space. Therefore, funding that may have been available for housing, education or welfare payments will not be there. Over €1.4 billion will have to be found to meet Irish Water's running costs and modernisation programme to 2021 if domestic charges are ceased. Sewage treatment plants do not compete easily with hospitals or houses when it comes to political priorities. That is why it must be taken out of politics and the task given to a utility. The people who paid - approximately 950,000 households - may be about to be made fools of. The 340,000 people who have already paid for water through wells and group schemes are being shown nothing but disregard by Fianna Fáil, in particular. What is more, Irish Water reported to me that during the general election the payment rate actually increased and while not all of the data were collected, a payment rate of just under 70% was likely.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	176	Then there was the "Prime Time" programme on 1 March. It is my view that if the suspension or abolition goes ahead, it will cost us more in the long run. There is one vital question: are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael acting within the law? Does the decision to suspend water charges run contrary to EU law and, in particular, Article 9 of the water framework directive? Ireland did have a derogation from water charges, but it was signed away by none other than Fianna Fáil in 2010, which committed to the introduction of domestic water charges at that point. We should note that the directive institutes the principle that the user pays and that costs must be recovered from the user or polluter of water. A failure to do this will likely result in substantial EU fines in the years ahead. Greece and Italy were both hit with fines running to millions of euro that were increasing by the day until environmental issues were tackled by the European Court of Justice.Why would countries which routinely pay for water grant us a new derogation? Furthermore, the European Commission has described the metering programme as a basic pre-requisite for implementing the directive. Many people in this House have no idea what Irish Water actually does and there are quite a few who chose not to learn what it does. I agree with former Minister Noel Dempsey that it has been almost impossible to have a rational debate on water for the last few years. As such, I take this opportunity to nail a few myths. First, nobody pays for water twice. Does our water system with boil water notices, leaking pipes and insecure supply look like something that we have paid for? Even in Northern Ireland, every home pays its local rates of which £200 goes to the water company along with general taxation.

If those in Right2Water really believe water is a human right - and I could not agree more - they might pay attention to the United Nations whose definition of access to water is not free water for everyone, but affordable water where the costs of providing it does not go above 3% of people's incomes. Protecting water as a resource is also essential in tackling climate change as energy use in water treatment is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. That is another fact that has been lost by the so-called "hard left" in this debate.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	203	I welcome this debate, the reasons for it and the background to it. I acknowledge the right of the Dáil to discuss this issue, especially considering the level of public discourse on the matter as a result of our own talks with Fine Gael on an agreement potentially to facilitate the formation of a Government. One is forgiven for questioning why this specific issue is given more coverage or consideration than the very pressing needs in the provision of housing and addressing homelessness, crime prevention, creating decent jobs, rural decline in towns and villages throughout the country and the massive waiting lists, to name a few of the issues that dog our country currently. I contend that all parties and none acknowledge those pressing needs in those areas. They acknowledge that with an agreed budgetary framework within fiscal rules priorities can be made by a new Government in these areas. An example of the collective responsibility of this new Dáil is in the area of housing where it was agreed by all parties and none to establish an emergency committee to explore the issue within a defined timeframe, consult with relevant sectors and stakeholders, make recommendations to the Dáil and subsequently to turn those recommendations over to a new housing Minister. It is an example of how this new Dáil can help and instruct government. In 2009, Fine Gael launched the NewERA document which contained the blueprint for a national commercial water utility to deliver water services as a full cost-recovery entity. Fianna Fáil in government, in its agreement with the troika for the provision of necessary funding, included in its potential mechanisms to close the gap of €35 billion between income and expenditure an option on water charging. By the time that Fianna Fáil Government and the subsequent Government closed the gap, water charges had still not been introduced. In effect, the introduction of a charging regime or commercial utility was not necessary or deemed necessary by any EU water framework directive. Fine Gael in government pursued the contents of the NewERA document, in particular the policy that ended up as Irish Water. Without going over old ground in great detail, it was rushed, ill-thought out, ill-advised and ill-conceived. It was most expensive, to put it mildly. It quickly ran out of control and became a runaway train costing billions of euro. It has cost the taxpayer on the double. It took revenue from the initial household charge and the motor taxation fund and it continues to take revenue from property tax funds. It has left local authorities at a massive loss. Despite all this funding, it is still spending less on repairs, maintenance and capital expenditure than was the case during the years 2000 to 2010. During the course of the passage of the various water services Bills in the last Dáil, there was no regard for the views of the Dáil. There was no space for scrutiny and there was no room for amendments. It was rammed down the throats of the Irish people by the last Government with the largest majority in the history of the State. Subsequently, there were 13 different U-turns by the Government which only served to make the sorry saga worse, more unpalatable, more confusing and more ridiculous. That is why it became the election issue it was. I accept and admit that it was not the most dominant issue but it was one which has now the ability to strangle and kill this Dáil and cause an election. It is against that background and for that reason that Fianna Fáil sought to be responsible and fair to the people. We sought to play our part in resolving this issue, to take the heat out of it and put a roadmap in place for a resolution, thus allowing us to seek the facilitation of a Government which is the overriding factor that must be taken into account. The overriding background music to the recent election was a trend from people that they now demand, not merely expect, that parties and candidates are true to their word and true to the commitments in their manifestos. Tesco ad politics and commitments on Labour's way over Frankfurt's way have done irreparable damage and must be stopped and put to bed. We made commitments in our manifesto in four key areas including securing home ownership and tackling homelessness, cutting costs for families and improving the services they rely on, creating decent jobs and supporting enterprises and in seeking to bring about crime prevention and support communities. Specifically, in the area of cutting costs, we said that in government we would seek to abolish Irish Water and scrap water charges. There is no doubt that we did well in the election, but we did not win it. We did not win enough seats to form or lead a Government.Our over-riding promise was not to enter into government with Fine Gael. There was no outright victory by any party or any obvious bloc. Three times we tried to form a minority Government, lead it and offer a change that we believed people sought but failed to secure one extra vote. We then had to acknowledge our responsibility by exploring the potential to facilitate Government formation while retaining our independence as an opposition party with the right to pursue the policies contained in our manifesto, as is the right of any other political party or person who has the privilege of representing voters. This allows us to set down our guiding principles. It allows for the potential to give value to the votes that we received and to work with the Dáil in instructing the Government. We realise that no one won the election but we recognise that the Dáil contains a majority that is against the water charges and the water charging regime that is in place in the form of a commercial utility. Consequently, we recognise the right of the Dáil to determine the future of those. Therefore, it is our duty to ensure that when the Dáil makes such a decision, it does so in full knowledge of the relevant expertise's recommendations on a charging or non-charging mechanism, on whether it should be a public utility or not and on facilities and appropriate statutory oversight to ensure that the work of any public utility is costed and delivered in a way that allows it to be measured against its performance and be adjudicated on by the Members of this House. Market conditions should be appropriately measured against European norms. This affords Deputies, who were elected by the people irrespective of who they were and where they came from, the opportunity to abolish, or otherwise, water charges or any mechanism for providing water services. It also affords us the opportunity to have an overarching utility that is publicly owned and publicly accountable to the Dáil and, by effect, the Irish people. This is the new sort of politics that people want to see. This is how they want the Dáil to have an input. They do not want us to disregard the result as given just because some will not enter into negotiations or seek to give them the desired outcome of the votes that they cast. It is a complicated situation that we find ourselves in but it is one in which we have a responsibility to ensure that a Government emanates from it. We do not expect to implement all of the policies in our manifesto because we will not be in government but we will facilitate a Government and allow it to be formed. One of the over-riding issues on which we gained our votes - not all of them but some in cities and large towns - was that of water charges. We have an obligation and duty to put the message to the Government that it cannot impose the will of the last Dáil on this one. That is why we are outside of government but we are giving value to the votes that were cast in our favour. It is incumbent on us and others to take that responsibility seriously and not to use the opportunity that some of the Deputies to my right have used ad infinitum. They will always be on the promise path and never on the decision-making one. However, we are taking our responsibility seriously. This is why we will continue exploring. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, including this issue, in terms of our facilitating Fine Gael in leading a government. We will take the responsibility and privilege given to us seriously and appropriately in the hope that we can have a better country because of it.

The debacle that has been Irish Water and water charges is a major issue for citizens. Due to the resilience and determination of those who campaigned on it, including tens of thousands of Right2Water activists, water charges and Irish Water have failed and were resoundingly rejected by the electorate in February's general election. Despite this, a motion calling for their abolition that was signed by 39 Teachtaí Dála is yet to be debated. We have been actively prevented from doing so. The Dáil is the people's assembly. It is supposed to be an independent Legislature. As Teachta Cowen rightly stated, each of us has been elected and mandated to fulfil the commitments we made to the electorate. A majority of Deputies sought and won a mandate to abolish Irish Water and scrap water charges. Sinn Féin's view is that Irish Water should now go and water charges be scrapped. This is our mandate. It is also Fianna Fáil's mandate. Fianna Fáil's manifesto calls clearly not once, but in three separate sections, for the abolition of Irish Water and the scrapping of water charges. This is the mandate to which it should be true. The same manifesto says nothing about the suspension of charges, maintaining the mechanism for charging on the Statute Book or kicking the can down the road in perpetuity.

After that vote, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil could return to negotiations in the knowledge that the issue of water and water charges had been handled in a democratic, transparent and open fashion to the satisfaction of the people who sent us all to the Dáil. Let me remind the Dáil that Sinn Féin prevented the privatisation of water in the North. We also stopped the introduction of domestic water charges. This is the precedent for our position and it works. I do not have the time to take us through the serial scams and fiascoes that mark the history of Irish Water and the Minister, Deputy Kelly's legacy. It would take too long. Suffice it to say that nothing less than the abolition of Irish Water and the scrapping of water charges will do. This is the message that we were given. Fine Gael must accept it. Fianna Fáil must honour it.

He and his colleagues in Fianna Fáil know a thing or two about verbal dexterity. Given the fact his party's U-turns on the issue over the years have turned into veritable cartwheels, "verbal gymnastics" is probably a more appropriate description. It is worth reminding the House of the positions of Fianna Fáil on this matter in recent years. In 2009, Deputy Micheál Martin and his party signed up to a programme for Government with the Green Party to introduce water charges. In 2010, Fianna Fáil, with Deputy Micheál Martin in the Cabinet, signed up to a programme for national recovery that included water charges. Only a few months later, it set a date of 2012 for the charges' introduction. On the basis of the figures in the document in question, that would have cost the average household €400 per year. Just in case the Deputy suggests that this was at a time when he was not the leader of Fianna Fáil, his party's manifesto in the first general election that he fought as its leader in 2011 made a commitment to continue the introduction of water metering and, by default, water charges.

Some 90 Deputies were elected to this House on a mandate of ending water charges and 39 of us have tabled the motion, as Deputy Adams stated earlier. I welcome the fact Fianna Fáil has abandoned a long-standing commitment to water charges. Why has it done so? It has done so under great pressure from the hundreds of thousands of people in the Right2Water movement who have campaigned against what we believe to be an unjust charge. It has done so under huge pressure from the Deputies in this House, including those from Sinn Féin, the Anti Austerity Alliance, People Before Profit, Independents 4 Change and other Independents. This is not about some road-to-Damascus conversion to a belief in a fairer society; this is Fianna Fáil doing what Fianna Fáil does best. Therefore, what should one do now? In our view, the Deputies who have not done so should put their names to the motion the rest of us have signed. It was deliberately worded to be consistent with their election manifesto. They should insist that the motion be tabled for debate and decision here and then they should vote with us. Deputy Micheál Martin was correct earlier when he said passing a motion will not change the law. We are not suggesting it would but it would achieve two important ends. First, it would give expression to the democratic will of the majority of voters who voted for Deputies to end water charges. In doing so, it would heap enormous pressure not only on Fine Gael but also on Fianna Fáil to ensure this unjust charge is scrapped. Irrespective of what Fianna Fáil does, Sinn Féin will continue to keep its word. We believe water is a human right and the Minister is correct in that regard. Since it is a human right, we believe it should be delivered on the basis of need and not ability to pay. On those grounds, we believe general taxation is the most appropriate way of funding water delivery from a social justice perspective. The Minister is also wrong on the water framework directive, and he knows it. The derogation is in Article 9.4. It was not given away. It is in place to be invoked and negotiated with the Commission at any stage. It is on those grounds that Sinn Féin believes this House should debate and vote on the motion to scrap Irish Water, scrap water charges and enshrine in the Constitution public ownership of water services. I suspect the reason Fianna Fáil has voted with Fine Gael to block the tabling of the motion is because, at some stage in the future, its members will seek again to do another U-turn on the issue. Instead of kicking the can down the road with a commission on the future of water services and charges and presenting it as some kind of victory for the democratic will to abolish the charge, they will turn once again and people will be left having to foot the bill for the broken promises of their party. Sinn Féin will not tolerate it nor will its colleagues in the Right2Water movement. Therefore, let us debate the motion, take the vote and force the scrapping of this unjust charge.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	228	I welcome the opportunity to outline the views of Fine Gael on the future of water services. It is important to state at the very outset that Fine Gael fully believes in the benefits of maintaining a national utility to fix, upgrade and maintain our water network so families and businesses can enjoy a secure and clean water supply. We also stand by our belief in the conservation of water as a precious natural resource through a metered charging regime. The creation of a single water utility by the last Government was in response to the shocking state of our national water infrastructure. Decades of inaction by previous Governments had brought our entire water system to the verge of collapse. While we all saw evidence of the decay, such as the cryptosporidium contamination in Galway, it was really only when Irish Water had been established that the extent of the crisis facing our infrastructure became clear for the first time. Almost 1 million citizens were at risk of contamination. One third of all major wastewater treatment plants were overloaded. At least 23,000 people had to boil water before using it, and many had to do so for years. Raw sewage was and still is being pumped directly into our seas, rivers and bays at more than 40 locations around the country. Two thirds of all sewers were in need of repair as raw sewage leaked into the ground. These issues have a real impact on people, families and businesses across the country in terms of health and quality of life. We could not stand over a system that was making people sick. It was clear that the disparate and fragmented approach to water as an inevitable consequence of having 34 separate local authorities responsible for local water services contributed to this broken and failed system. After considering the issue fully, a decision was made to consolidate water services into a single national utility. This decision was taken to protect families and secure our water supplies long into the future. The accusation from some of a secret agenda of privatisation is completely bogus and untrue. The hard yards in establishing Irish Water have now been taken. The early investment and reform measures are now starting to deliver real results for communities across the country. In the three years since a single utility has taken over responsibility for water services, we now have for the first time a plan and a long-term vision for water infrastructure. Irish Water has removed almost 300,000 people from the EPA at-risk drinking water register by implementing required disinfection technologies in water treatment plants. It has already removed 20,000 people from the long-term boil-water notice circumstances in which they were living. It has repaired more than 500 km of the worst water mains that were continually failing people. It has upgraded wastewater treatment plants in places such as Swords, Naas, Leixlip, Galway, Clifden, Dunmore East, Ardmore, Clonakilty and Carrigtwohill. It has saved more than 32 million litres of water, enough to serve the counties of Carlow and Laois combined, and it has identified a further 80 million litres that can be saved through fixing household leaks. Also, critically, it has reduced operating costs by 14% and identified more than €200 million in capital savings on large projects in planning. The decision to create a single water utility was the correct one. It is working and it is here to stay. Over the course of the next five years, the utility has an ambitious €5.5 billion works programme to bring our water infrastructure up to an acceptable standard. This will involve the removal of all supplies from the EPA’s at-risk list, benefiting nearly 1 million households. This will eliminate all boil-water notices across the country and reduce leaks to a rate of 38%, as opposed to the current rate of 49%, saving 180 million litres of water per day. That is the task we are embarking on. The utility will end the scandal of pumping raw and untreated sewage into our rivers and onto our beaches, including at Cork Harbour, into which 50,000 houses are currently pumping raw sewage. That will be fixed within the next 18 months by Irish Water. Irish Water will secure water supplies for a growing Dublin region and deliver water improvements and derisk supplies in every county. As part of our discussions with Fianna Fáil on its facilitation of a Fine Gael-led minority Government, we have discussed the possibility of creating an oversight committee on Irish Water that will report to the Oireachtas to boost transparency and ensure targets are being met. On water charges, as the House will be aware, talks are ongoing on the formation of a Fine Gael-led minority Government with Fianna Fáil. During these discussions, Fine Gael has maintained its long-running policy of supporting a single water utility and a water charging regime that supports conservation and protects funding for clean water supplies. However, the facts are to be seen. Fine Gael won 50 seats in the recent election and the parties of the last Government can no longer impose their will on the Dáil. Instead, we need to persuade people on the merits of good public policy, informed by experts and best practice. While I hear very clearly today and relate to the frustrations outlined by Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, the fact is that without agreement with Fianna Fáil on water, it is inevitable that a rushed vote on the future of Irish Water and water charges will be taken in a politically charged environment in the aftermath of an election.The result would have been a massive public policy mistake that we would have regretted. Pending a final outcome of the ongoing discussions with Fianna Fáil, we have discussed the possibility of establishing an expert commission to examine funding models, charging and conservation incentives. The commission could send its recommendations to an Oireachtas committee for further investigation and testimony from experts. Independent legal advice to the Dáil should also be considered on Ireland's obligations under EU water directives. This process could provide time and space to conduct an informed and detailed discussion for a period of approximately nine months, during which time water charges would be put on hold to create space for this debate and fair consideration.  Following this process, the Dáil would need to make a decision, which would be a test for politics and all those who speak about new politics. Do we accept independent expert advice about what is best for the country and vote accordingly or do we retreat behind party political positions designed for electoral gain? Fine Gael will vote for a charging regime that supports the best principles of water conservation and the provision of clean water for homes and businesses. The priority for this party, three months after an election, is to form a Government that can adequately deal with the many challenges facing the people, of which water provision is one. The current discussions between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil can provide a basis to allow us to move on from the current political impasse with which so many people outside the House are losing patience.  I believe we will secure the future of Irish Water as a single water utility. Detailed discussions on the nature of water funding can lead to a path towards an agreed and settled water charging infrastructure. Most important, this must be a model that is accepted by the vast majority of people on the basis of argument and evidence of what is right. This infrastructure must ensure families and businesses receive the safe and clean water supplies they need.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	229	The Government is losing and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is a very bad loser. Once upon a time, not very long ago, the Government seemed strong and the people seemed weak. Then the anti-water charges movement came along and it is now the people who seem strong and the Government-in-waiting which seems weak, nervous and fearful of the people. This is reflected in the emerging deal on water charges. The hundreds of thousands of people who marched, the 750,000 households which boycotted water charges and the hundreds of communities nationwide that blocked meter installation are responsible for forcing the forthcoming suspension of water charges. The backtracking by the Government parties is vindication of the work done by each and every one of these campaigners, all of whom I congratulate.  We are in favour of the abolition, as opposed to the suspension, of water charges. Once this particular car has stopped and the engine has cooled, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will have a bloody hard job restarting the motor and getting it back on the road. In France people say what parliament does, the street can undo. This refers to the power of the working class - the broad mass of people - to make and break governments and unpopular and wrong government decisions. This tradition is taking root in this Republic and what has been started on water charges can and, I hope, will be done on pay, housing and other issues.  Who is making the concessions this week? While it is true that Fine Gael is being forced to backtrack, parties that campaigned in favour of water charges in the general election are in a minority in the House, whereas parties that campaigned against them are in the majority. By kicking the can down the road and keeping water charges on life support, it is the Fianna Fáil Party that is making concessions. Why should that surprise anyone, given that it is the party that first discussed water charges in the Cabinet? According to Cabinet records released under freedom of information legislation, the Cabinet discussed water charges twice in 2010, incidentally at a rate of €500 per annum. Instead of abolishing Irish Water, as it promised in the general election, Fianna Fáil is agreeing to keep it in place. Instead of ending water charges, as it undertook to do in its manifesto, it is keeping them on life support. The purpose of the proposed commission will be to try to save water charges. People cannot place any trust in Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil on this matter. Irish Water must be abolished and water charges scrapped. The metering programme must be stopped and all arrears of non-payers written off. Those who paid, often under duress, must have their moneys repaid and all charges against those who bravely campaigned against water charges must be dropped. Last but not least, the Government must invest €1 billion per annum in water infrastructure. The money to do so is available. The Sunday Times rich list published at the weekend showed that the richest 250 people in Ireland own €73 billion. A modest millionaire tax would be more than enough to cover this investment.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	230	I congratulate people in every town, townland, village and city, including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and on every housing estate who for the past four years have put their shoulders to the wheel and fought tirelessly to see this day come. Irish Water and water charges may not have been abolished, but we are witnessing the beginning of the end. Although we have not gone the whole nine yards, as the previous speaker noted, there is a major chink in the armour of those who pursued an agenda of water charges. I congratulate those who fought and boycotted water charges, endured police harassment, went before the courts or sent to jail. Organised by the Right2Water movement and other groups, people turned out on the streets again and again in their tens of thousands. During the general election campaign the Fianna Fáil Party stole the clothes of the left in order that its members could portray themselves as warriors leading the fight against Irish Water and water charges. Its manifesto declared it would abolish Irish Water and water charges. The U-turn the party made today illustrates the point that what matters is that more than 90 Deputies were elected on the basis of getting rid of water charges. Today, it has been finally recognised that democracy must play a role in the House. It was for this reason that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were forced to park this issue for a period and begin to negotiate on how they would deal with it.We believe that eventually we must see the abolition of water charges and Irish Water. It is only a matter of time before that happens as the people will not get off the streets and will punish those who betray the vote they gave them. This is important when we look at the history of Irish Water, about which nobody wants to talk. I believe the Dublin 4 set and the media do not really get the people. They do not really get what is wrong when we say we are not paying water charges and when we get up at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. to block the installation of water meters. They do not get it that some people are willing to end up in prison or march consistently. When we look back at the formation of Irish Water, we see an absolute debacle. If €2 million is owed to the people who paid water charges, let those who made a bags of the issue pay them back, such as IBM which was paid nearly €49 million in a contract; Accenture which was paid €17 million; others which were paid €13 million; Ernst & Young which was paid €4 million; Goodbody's which was paid €2 million; KPMG which was paid €2 million; Mr. John Tierney, head of Irish Water, who paid €200,000, plus bonuses; as well as other CEOs who also scandalously received bonuses. The scandal went on and on. We also had the Siteserv scandal, with Mr. Denis O'Brien in the middle of it. People do not forget this kind of cronyism, corruption and disgraceful way of treating our most important national resources. Water is our most important natural resource. Wars have been and will be fought over it. It is not a commodity that can just be treated in the same as any other. We can live up to 70 days without food, as hunger strikers in the North and elsewhere have proved, but we cannot survive for more than three to five days without water. That is the reason we must ensure it is publicly controlled and funded through progressive taxation that provides for the wealth to be shared. The people have been overburdened by austerity and taxed again and again on their homes. They have lost their bin services to private companies which are pushing prices up by extraordinary amounts. They know that this could happen with water, which is why they are determined to fight with every breath in their body, often to the extent of going to prison or making significant sacrifices in their communities. They want to ensure the politicians they have elected who are sitting in this House and claim it does not really matter whether we postpone water charges or abolish Irish Water know that this matters. They will know it come the next election. If they promise something, they should deliver. That is what democracy should be like, rather than the debacle we witnessed today, when we had to vote on whether we should have a vote. Of course, we should have a vote on this issue. That is what we were elected to do. It is about time there was real democracy, rather than the sham democracy whereby the very wealthy and the quangos are looked after. We need to end this, but given the the co-operation Fianna Fáil is about to give Fine Gael, we are going to see more of it. The people need to stay alert and in the movement because we are going to push the whole nine yards, until Irish water which is clinging onto the edge of the grave is kicked into it and buried.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	231	I too congratulate the people who came out in their thousands in the past year and a half. Over 1 million people in seven major demonstrations walked shoulder to shoulder with the Right2Water movement which changed the face of politics in this country. After years of austerity, the straw that broke the backs of the people was water, Irish Water and the potential privatisation of a natural resource to meet a human need. Today we are inching closer to the abolition of Irish Water and water charges. I agree that Fine Gael and the Labour Party had a mandate when they introduced the hated water charges and the Irish Water structure; it is in their faces that they did not receive a mandate in the recent general election to continue that policy. Their austerity policies were rejected. Fianna Fáil received support and extra seats because it decided to rob the overcoat of the progressive left in this Dáil and put out the message that it would abolish water charges and Irish Water. However, neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil can stand up to its backbenchers and say it is carrying out its mandate or what was in its manifesto. Therefore, the issue must be taken off the negotiating table. They should agree what they want to agree regarding a minority Government and the other issues on which they can agree, but they must bring this issue back to the Dáil, either through a vote on the motion tabled by 39 Deputies or by agreeing to a minority Government and then allowing this debate to happen in the Dáil. Then the 90 or so Deputies who have been given a mandate to scrap Irish Water and water charges will have the opportunity to have a real debate on the issue. We need water conservation and a proper retrofit of our homes to reduce leakages to the recommended amount. If there was only clean water coming through our taps and it was not being flushed down our toilets, how many litres of water would be saved each day? The implementation of such measures is important. It is vital that a national water and sanitation board be set up but along the lines of the National Transportation Authority.

The general election results made the decision for us on that issue and the House should have been allowed to vote on it today. As Deputy Bríd Smith said, the history of the introduction of the charges in Dáil Éireann was farcical and extremely undemocratic, with late night and guillotined debates. The former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, and the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, clearly showed that they did not understand the basic economics of water charges and conservation and demonstrated a disgraceful misuse of taxpayers' money in the setting up of the quango Irish Water. During debates many Deputies, including me, put the figures and questions to the Minister, but he had no answers to them. He did not have the basic economics of the issue worked out in any way, shape or form. He just ploughed ahead with the stubbornness that has devastated his party. A few days ago he said the abolition of water charges would make fools of people. However, it was he who made fools of them. He certainly made fools of Labour Party backbenchers, 80% of whom bit the dust in the recent contest. Water charges were the straw that broke the camel's back, after the years of harsh austerity, cuts in health services, housing, disability payments, pensions, etc. and increases in taxes and charges. Ordinary people have said enough is enough, on which I congratulate them. The movement to abolish water charges was very powerful in my constituency, where groups such as Clare Hall Says No, Edenmore Says No and Coolock Says No were determined to get rid of this harsh imposition on the backs of the people. In my earlier career, when I was chairman of Dublin City Council's general purposes committee, we oversaw the water supply system for Dublin and a chunk of mid-Leinster. We consistently asked Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-led Governments for the money we needed from central taxation to run the system properly. Most other EU capital cities had standby reservoir reserves of 10% or 20%, but this was the only major capital city that did not have such a reservoir. Unfortunately, those Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil dominated Governments refused point blank to give us the money we needed. Irish Water and water charges must be abolished immediately.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	233	The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, told us that we needed Irish Water because of the need to stop leaks and the waste of water. Why were the leaks not tackled immediately after Irish Water was set up? Some 40% of water in Dublin is still leaking into the ground. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, said this was about conservation. The Government paid people a conservation grant of €100, but they could leave the bath water running all night. Where is the conservation element?  The Minister also spoke about best practice. The Government spent a fortune on consultants to learn what best practice was, but when it had to go back to local authority engineers, it was told that what had been just designed was a load of rubbish. It binned that design and then took advice from local authority engineers who had been running the existing system. What a waste of money that was. It would be cheaper to abandon Irish Water. People are considering the amount that would be wasted in doing away with it, but more would be wasted in keeping it.We need a State-run regional water system and we do not need the entity called "Irish Water". Just about everybody in this House was okay with the idea of water being paid for through central taxation, which is a fair system. Direct taxation is based on ability to pay but we now have the highest indirect taxation in Europe, which makes it very unfair. A water tax does not incorporate one's ability to pay. During the election campaign in Wexford, of the 20,000 houses on whose doors I knocked I would say one half of the inhabitants would struggle to pay any water charge. Irish Water was set up as a commercial entity so that it could be easily sold. In England today, households pay approximately €900 per year for water. The Irish people are dead right to oppose any water charge such as this and we should continue to pay for water through a fair central taxation system.

The penny does not seem to have dropped with Fine Gael and the Labour Party that they lost the election. They were utterly hammered and their policies absolutely rejected by the Irish people. Of course, they never had a mandate to bring in Irish Water or water charges in the first place, having lied to the electorate in the previous election to this one. Their betrayal sparked the biggest movement of people power in this State for decades and it is as a result of that movement of non-compliance and civil disobedience on the part of citizens who self-organised that Fine Gael has been dragged screaming and kicking into its backroom deal with Fianna Fáil on the issue. We should not be here discussing a fudge. Following the recent election, the mandate of this House and of a majority of the Deputies who were elected is for the abolition of Irish Water, the ending of water charges as a direct charge and the enshrining of water as a public service funded from central taxation as part of our Constitution. Water is and should be a human right and we have one of the lowest levels of water poverty in Europe, which is something about which we should be very proud. People should be able to access water on the basis of need rather than the ability to pay and I find it nauseating to listen to Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies saying they need the money. Ordinary citizens have paid for this but the Government slashed taxes to wealthy earners in successive budgets. Had they chosen to collect that tax we would have had more than enough money to invest in our water supply to bring in the conservation measures that would have an impact and improve the service. I agree with those who said we should be voting on this. We should not be facilitating a fudge by dragging it out. The sooner we abolish Irish Water the cheaper it will be and I have no doubt that day will eventually come because the Irish citizens will not tolerate anything less.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	235	I propose to share time with Deputy Catherine Murphy. I welcome the fact that the issue of Irish Water has been brought into the Dáil for debate. It is something the Social Democrats called for this week. It is an important issue but it is only one of the important issues facing the country, and we are also dealing with crises in homelessness, housing, distressed mortgages, health care and child poverty, to name but a few. However, it would have been entirely unacceptable for the Thirty-second Dáil to fall because of an inability on the part of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to find a compromise solution in talks in which none of the rest of the Dáil is involved. Most, if not all, Members of the House agree that investment in the water system is required to the tune of an additional several hundred million euro per year for at least the next seven to ten years. Most, though probably not all, Members of the House also agree that the water supply should remain in permanent public ownership in this country. The solution to the second of those points is very straightforward. First, we should hold a referendum seeking to change Article 10 of the Constitution enshrining the water supply in public permanent ownership. Second, we should disband Irish Water as a commercial semi-State and set up a public board, or whatever we might call it. Those two acts would absolutely guarantee that the Irish water system remains in permanent public ownership. Regardless of what happens to domestic charges, those two things should happen and I imagine that a very strong majority of this House would support a referendum and ending the commercial semi-State entity that is Irish Water. The solution to how to find the funds for investment is a lot more complex. The main argument for domestic charges has been that the money is needed for additional investment but this is a false argument. The economics of the water charge are such that the money raised more or less covers the cost of raising the money so not a single euro paid out by Irish households is being used to invest in the water system, nor is it being used to provide people with water. It covers the cost of taking the money from them. Nevertheless, capital investment is happening. This is much needed and welcome but how is it happening if the domestic water charge is not raising any money to make it happen? It is happening because Irish Water is borrowing. The second argument put forward by the Government for a domestic water charge is that a domestic water charge allows Irish Water to borrow this money, which means we do not have to shrink the fiscal space to which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, referred. However, Irish Water is borrowing on balance sheet so the Irish State can borrow on balance sheet, but at a much lower cost, to do exactly the same thing. It costs approximately twice as much money in Ireland per capita to supply water as it does in the UK, including in Northern Ireland where there is a similar geography and population density. Therein lies the answer to finding the several hundred million euro per year required for capital investment in the system. Targets have already been set and agreed by the regulator and a significant cost saving can be found by bringing 34 utilities into one national entity and that money can and should be used to fund the upgrading of the system. There is a short-term cashflow lag between the savings that can be found because, for example, it would have to be done without compulsory redundancies, so it would take time. The investment, however, is required now and Irish Water is bridging that funding gap by borrowing but it is borrowing on balance sheet and the State can do exactly the same thing. It is a reasonable argument to suggest that everybody be provided with a very generous allowance for free and we would charge people for excess usage. The reason not to do that is that it costs some €100 million a year to charge people for water and it is too expensive just to stop a very small number of people from using too much water. For these reasons, the Social Democrats believes the domestic water charge in Ireland does not make sense. We would like to see a referendum held, the commercial semi-State ended and a national water board constituted.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	236	What appears to be happening now is that the entity known as Irish Water is to remain and water charges are to be suspended. The word "abolition" does not come into the argument, but that is what the majority of Deputies have a mandate for. This was a dishonest enterprise from the outset. The aim was to turn citizens into customers and to transfer €11 billion of assets to Irish Water. People quickly came to the conclusion that this was all about the privatisation of the water service. The aim was to get full cost recovery and there was little consideration for how much people had in their household budgets after the additional taxes and charges were taken out.The last Government was a Government for the few, not for the many. The people have reacted to that and reversed it. In the best systems in the world, one will get no better than a 20% leakage rate; it does not go below that. The cost-benefit analysis will not support digging up a street for a small quantity of water, and there are many small leaks. That is as good as one will get it. Good telemetry can achieve a great deal. Irish Water's 20-year plan was to reduce the leakage rate to 30% and yet the first county in which water meters were installed was Kildare. Before a single water meter was installed the leakage rate was 25% because there was good telemetry. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said that the investment made in the system so far is producing results. Most of that investment, if it is not coming from the amount that was borrowed, mainly comes from the motor tax fund which formerly funded local government until property tax was introduced. The local government fund was stripped out and that has gone to Irish Water. That is how the investment is being made in the improvements. As I said, the last Government was a Government for the few, not the many, and that is what people have concluded with regard to the people who gained as a result of the introduction of this entity. How the meter contracts were awarded or to whom they were awarded was part of that. The Cregan inquiry was set up to inquire into IBRC and the sale of Siteserv. That has stalled. Indeed, the deadline for the inquiry was extended to the end of April, which is next weekend, but there is nothing forthcoming from the Department of the Taoiseach about what will happen to the inquiry. Two legislative measures, one on privilege and one on confidentiality, must be introduced to allow that inquiry to proceed. The inquiry must proceed and I will continue to raise it at every available opportunity to ensure that it proceeds. It is also costing approximately €12,000 per week just to rent accommodation for the inquiry. The inquiry is at a standstill. A statement must be made in the House on how it will proceed because it must proceed until it comes to a conclusion. People felt that they were being made fools of with regard to Irish Water. It was constantly raised on the doorsteps that they were being pushed beyond their ability to pay, being pauperised and that some people were gaining from this at a point when they were being asked to shoulder another burden. They railed against that. Sometimes people might not like the result of democracy, and the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, obviously does not, but the one thing about democracy is that one must respect the result. The people have spoken on this and the majority of Members of the Dáil were elected on a mandate to abolish Irish Water.

Do we have a fundamental disconnect with nature or the environment? Is there something in our history, character or national story which means that we do not really take care about the way we interact with nature? One can look at that in different ways. Sometimes, one can be optimistic and think we are very connected to this land but at other times, one thinks that we are not. If one considers the way we have dealt with water over the last 30 or 40 years and the way we treat our wastewater, one emerges with a very poor assessment of how we connect to nature. For decades, we have planned and built without care or consideration for where we would get water and what we would do with our sewerage and other wastewater systems. We built housing without installing proper wastewater services, sufficient water supply systems or sufficient processing systems to ensure we would get the best quality. We were willing to turn a blind eye and to allow all sorts of practices to develop which, had we really thought about them, we would have known would not work, would pump raw sewage into our streams and cause long-term pollution. That problem started to become transparent when the country started to boom. I recall that it finally caught up with us when further development was being considered in Sandyford Industrial Estate in my former constituency, which is now Deputy Catherine Martin's constituency. The development part of the council was gung-ho to build and to zoom up 30 storey buildings with an Alpine garden on the top. A scientist was obliged to point out that nothing could be done in that area because the water and wastewater systems would not cope with another shed. At the same time, the very beneficial European directives were beginning to drive home the reality of what we had done to our land and our water. We were in breach of almost every environmental directive and were the worst in class in terms of meeting those standards. This was a country that had a green, natural image and in which we had a sense of ourselves as living in harmony with nature but we were fouling our water supply system like no others. We started to invest in trying to address that problem. Ireland ended up being fined because it had septic tanks everywhere that were leaking and we had to tackle that problem. The Government in which I participated was spending €500 million per year, in difficult economic times, because we realised this was a crisis and that we had to change our ways. At that time, we also had a tax commission to examine how we were managing our tax system. Within that, there was a broad strategic assessment that we had to broaden our tax system away from just tax on labour and value added tax, VAT, and to start putting taxes in place that would get efficiencies and help us to live with nature in a more effective way. It was on that basis that we met with Fianna Fáil in the autumn of 2009 and in revising the programme for Government, we agreed that we would bring forward the concept of developing a surcharge on the wasteful use of water. I cannot recall every moment of those long and, as the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, said, sometimes tortuous and fraught negotiations but I am quite sure about one thing - there was not a voice or moment of dissent from Fianna Fáil on the basic wisdom of that approach and principle at that time. It went into the revised programme for Government. The former Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, came to the Cabinet with a proposal. It included, as an absolute measure, that whatever we should do should be fair. It should allow people to have a basic allowance so that there is a right to water. It should enshrine a constitutional referendum so we start taking ownership of our connection with nature and ownership of our public water supply. We left the Government and in the one week between our leaving and the Government falling, the approach was changed by a small measure. Fianna Fáil agreed with the public service to change the nature of how to go about doing it. When Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office, they also changed, without any consultation, the report that had been commissioned to examine the best model. They changed it from saying what sort of single authority should be put in place to saying what sort of commercial utility should be put in place. There was no discussion, no public consultation and no report or analysis. With the stroke of a pen, people were saying that was the solution. Therein lies our problem today. Deputy Kelly's predecessor went at this bald-headed. He did not allow a debate in the House. He established a flat rate charge which had none of the sophistication that was required to win the public over on this. It did not help to have a conservation grant which had no benefit in terms of conservation or really changing the system. Members of the House know the full details of what has happened in the last four or five years. There is no need to rehearse that and the public movement in which others on this side of the House participated. I understand where they are coming from in terms of this being a validation, in a sense, of that public movement. However, what comes next? What is really in the public interest here? From talking to people who were at those marches and who were adamant on the campaign I find I have a certain common cause. I believe we should examine certain principles. Deputy Cowen said he wishes to be guided by the guiding principles of Fianna Fáil in this.I am not sure what they are, but I suggest that everyone does have a right to water and that we give a very generous basic allowance so that no one in the State is ever threatened with not having the availability of water. It is not a standard commercial project. Let us do this and enshrine it in a constitutional change, which maybe does not just look at the privatisation issue but might also look at starting to put value on our connection to nature and, for the first time, recognise in our Constitution that the protection of nature is something we need to include in a modern republic and a wider sense of our republic. Let us also ensure it is fair, in the sense that those who can pay more do so and those who cannot pay do not have to pay, by using the same money we gave in the conservation allowance to cover those who are least able to afford it. Deputy Donnelly did not think there was a case for going after those who are wasting the most. People can differ with my figures if they are not true, but as I understand it Irish Water has stated the top 1% use 22% of the water. This is obviously through leaks as they are not having a bath every two seconds. Catching this would not be a small saving. I understand that according to the figures the top 7% consume six times the average and this is worth addressing. For me, a principle is we must retain some charge to maintain a conservation incentive. If we do not monitor and measure we do not care. I still hold out hope that in whatever the mechanism and deal being done between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael we will not throw out the baby with the bath water and we will be able to come back and vote in the House on some type of system that is similar to every other developed country in the world. If the French revolutionaries think this is an issue about which they should be on the streets to change the government why are they not doing so? Why do they pay something in France and in every other country? If the commission to be established could come back with a proposal to the House which includes a right to water, has an element of real fairness and still maintains the principles of monitoring and measuring and stopping and discouraging waste, it might get the support of the majority. I do not know how the commission would do this or how to combine the various wisdom and different motions but I would like to see it try. I would certainly like to see something which starts changing our understanding of our connection with nature because this is what is at play. It is of fundamental importance to the Irish people that when we turn on our taps we think the water that emerges is pristine, the best, what we are good at and we are proud when we have visitors to this country. I used to work in summer tourism in west Clare and regularly I used to have to tell people not to drink the water. The system could not cope with the bigger number of people, and every time I was in west Clare people got sick. I had them in the van for two days with diarrhoea, which was no fun. This was because system could not cope. According to the latest figures on where we dump raw sewage and where our system cannot cope, it is all around the coast. It is in every tourism spot in the country. How can we hold up our heads regarding being a clean island and bring visitors here if we are one of the worst in terms of care for our environment and looking after our most basic environmental necessity, which is our water?

The UN has declared water is a human right and has calculated that a person needs between 50 litres and 100 litres of water daily to meet their needs for consumption, cleaning, cooking and other domestic uses. The average consumption per person in Ireland is 150 litres to 170 litres per day. Countries which have introduced metering have reduced consumption by 40% by being conscious that water is a precious resource. If this were replicated in Ireland it would mean approximately 100 litres per day would be the new Irish average. If this volume, or an agreed volume, is exceeded there should be a charge for the excess volume. A 40% conservation would lead to decreased production and treatment costs and would allow this saving to be invested in infrastructure. Leakage of water from the system prior to arriving at its destination can be up to 50%. Thus, Irish Water, through infrastructural investment, should be able to reduce the leakage to less than 25% and reduce production costs, making additional savings. Savings in water production and the charges for commercial use and excessive domestic use could then be supplemented by general taxation to allow Irish Water to continue its essential infrastructure work on water delivery and wastewater treatment so that good clean water is available to everyone at no cost or at a reasonable cost. Water must be seen as a precious valuable resource which must be used responsibly. Irish Water needs to be restructured and reviewed to be efficient and effective. Additionally, Irish Water needs to be retained in public ownership. Irish Water engineers and front-line staff should not be vilified but supported in their work. However, the management structure needs to be reviewed and restructured now to prevent it becoming over-managed and under-led, similar to the HSE. Our water system must be modernised urgently to bring Ireland to international standards at a reasonable agreed cost.

There is no doubt it is very emotive and is the one which probably attracts the most attention in the media. Many Members on the opposite side of the House campaigned almost exclusively on this issue alone and would not have won their seats but for the issue of water. At this stage I believe the public is tired of the constant talking and media attention given to the water issue. Despite what other people may say, during the election campaign water was not the issue about which people on the doorstep wanted to talk. They wanted to talk about health, education, housing and the economy. They wanted to know our plans for the health services, how could we improve the waiting times in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and improve the services available in Louth County Hospital in Dundalk. They wanted to know the plans for the education sector, how we would reduce class sizes in secondary and primary schools, improve access to third level education institutions, such as Dundalk Institute of Technology, and provide the funds to continue with a very active capital investment programme in our schools. On housing, they wanted to know how we would provide the extra housing required to address the housing and homelessness issues which, unfortunately, exist today.

They wanted to know how we were going to continue to attract home the many young men and women who had to leave our shores in search of work during the crash. They also let it be known, in no uncertain terms, that we must never ever go back to the boom and bust policies of the previous Government. I find it interesting that in a survey of people who voted in the last general election, only 8% voted with water as their main issue, but here we are today debating water as though it was the only issue affecting the country at present. We should not forget that until recently we were the only country in Europe that did not charge for water services. The upgrade of the water and waste water services is estimated to cost just under €1 billion per year. No matter what anybody says, this money has to come from somewhere. It will not appear out of nowhere. It has to come from the public funds. The most important business we have in the house at present is the formation of a stable Government.It appears that the only option is a minority Fine Gael-led Government. If it is the case, as it appears to be, that in order for this to happen water charges are to be suspended for a period of time, all households that have paid their water charges must be fully reimbursed, should the charges not be reintroduced. If charges are reintroduced, those who have paid their water charges must receive the full credit for their payments. We also need to consider the situation of members of group water schemes who have been paying for their water for years. We cannot simply ignore them. I am happy for an independent commission to consider issues relating to the charging for water and for this to be considered by a Dáil committee. The House will then have an opportunity to vote on how we are to finance our public water and waste water services in the future. As with all other issues, I am happy to listen to all Members, regardless of what party or alliance they belong to, if a workable and fair solution can be found. Too many people in this House use the water issue as a political football for cheap political and populist gain yet offer no viable or workable alternative. We have heard a lot of talk of new politics since the election. This is another example how the new politics can be put to use. Let us see how we can all work together and come up with a solution that will allow us to provide the public with a water and waste water service that is both cost-effective and fit for purpose. I would like to put again on the record of the House my position on water charges, should they be suspended. All households, bar none, should be fully reimbursed, should the charges not be reintroduced. If charges are reintroduced, those who have paid their water charges must receive a credit for their payments to date. I look forward to hearing the views of other Members on this issue.

I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and will be as brief as I can in putting a few concise points on the record. This day, and the stalemate we have arrived at in this debate, marks a sad departure. We are seeing the substitution of principled politics with popular politics and that is not a good turn for the country, democracy, the environment, the economy or politics as a whole. I regret that we have chosen to go this route and I would like to register in my own way my thoughts on the matter. It is a retrograde step to abolish or suspend charges - we can play with the words - because the reality of the charging system is that water will have to be paid for somehow, and the €270 million that is collected per annum by Irish Water will now arguably have to come out of roads or health. I have not heard anybody decide yet which one of these areas will suffer. It is also indiscriminate in the extreme to abolish or suspend charges and give a cheque of €160 back to each and every household, irrespective of its means. A lot of myths about Irish Water and the regime of charging for water are in circulation, was aided by certain elements in the media which are very hungry to see near anarchy and excitement. One can see the same media starting to shift their approach now and we will see them taking a very responsible attitude in the future towards the charging for water and the potential abolition of Irish Water-----

Belatedly they are coming to that party. I come from a constituency where 20% to 30% of the people may not be provided with water, are paying for their own water and have to sink wells, pay maintenance and electricity costs, etc. I hope that point is well understood at this stage. However, the provision of water across Ireland by 34 separate local authorities costs €1.3 billion. Under Irish Water, as a single utility, the provision of the same water to the State costs €800 million per annum. I am not a mathematical genius, but that is a saving of €500 million per annum with the establishment of a single utility to provide water to the nation, as per electricity or any other utility in this country. There is a lot of toil, sweat and tears to be done by working people to enable them contribute that saving to the Exchequer. Just because we want to abandon principle, leave principled politics at the door and chase popular politics in a race to the bottom we are willing to forgo this saving as a starting point. That is deeply regrettable for anybody who continues to agitate for the abolition of Irish Water. Another myth is that people's road tax is going into Irish Water. Again, the media has been very difficult in this regard, and I have tried for my part several times to make these points about Irish Water to the media but they had no interest in them. The reality is that the function of water was removed from the local authorities and so was a certain part of its funding stream. Road tax always went into the provision of water. Where do we think the money for the €1.3 billion cost of water was coming from? It always came from road tax-----

It is about making the hard decisions and choices and showing leadership, not about following the populist race to the bottom. I must disagree with my party colleague who spoke about the charges being refunded. It would be a nonsense to refund charges and I would hate to see that happen. The law, as laid down in this House for right or wrong, good or evil - we either respect the institution that is Dáil Éireann or we do not - is that water charges are to be applied and people are to pay them. Anybody who has not paid them should be chased by the utility, be it through attachment orders, which we have already legislated for in this House, or whatever other means necessary. We cannot have a two-tier or à la carte system. We either have a law we all subscribe to or we do not. Is that what we are going to do now with those who will not pay their TV licences? Is the solution to give everybody else back their money? It is a nonsense beyond all levels imaginable. We are where we are. We have to negotiate with the Fianna Fáil Party and I respect that. We do not have the mandate that we had previously. I also respect that. We have to compromise.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	268	We sought this debate because we believe it is important for Deputies to be able to outline their approach to the broad issue of water services, and if we want this debate to be useful, it would be constructive if Deputies concentrated on outlining their own policies. This is very far from being the single most important issue facing our country. However, it is important, and the handling of it in recent years represents a dramatic public policy fiasco. It is also one of the few areas where there was a substantial policy debate during the election and a decisive result in favour of ending the current policy. There has been an enormous amount of ill-informed and highly skewed coverage of this issue in recent weeks. The scale of lobbying and media briefing by a commercial State body using public money has been unprecedented. This has distorted the debate and ensured that manifestly false claims are being made on behalf of existing policy. During the past five years and during the election, Fianna Fáil was clear in setting out its policy and addressing various eventualities. Many have presented distorted and superficial claims about our policies, but distorting and misrepresenting our policies has been a consistent reason that so many failed to anticipate growing public support for our party. We opposed the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of the charge. Leaving aside the issue of the arrogant failure of the outgoing Government to justify the model of a national commercial utility or to outline the actual costs involved in the administrative and charging regimes imposed, we had other substantive problems. We accept the need to invest in improving our water services but to say that the existing framework is the only way this work can be funded and delivered is not true. The comparison with the ESB is fatuous. The ESB does not require State subvention. It is a genuinely commercial firm, albeit providing a vital public service. More importantly, the ESB does not demand that users pay it for years before it can guarantee an acceptable service.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	270	The outgoing Government’s policy was to allow Irish Water massive commercial freedom even though it would be funded primarily by direct State subvention and it would take many years to bring services to the level the company itself defines as acceptable. Irish Water is very far from being the accepted model of water service provision and development internationally. Northern Ireland and Scotland are very much the exceptions in Europe. Comparable countries to Ireland manage to deliver major water infrastructure developments without a commercial utility like Irish Water as it is now constituted. A service delivered with ongoing public investment should most properly be delivered by State agencies. Had Irish Water been a State agency from the outset, the uncontrolled expansion of management, the bonus culture, the waste, the secrecy, the €0.33 million spend on polling, the massive and rising payments for lobbying and many other practices would not have been possible. Equally, the disdain for democratic accountability would never have been allowed. The consistent claim for Irish Water was that this was the only way of raising the funding required for investment, and this is simply false. In fact, the commercial State firm has reduced potential funding for investment. Not only has Irish Water's investment programme failed to be taken out of government borrowing figures, there is no plan on the table from anyone which shows how this could happen. Commentators who state that we are facing a choice between off-balance sheet borrowing and public funding need to look at the facts. There are no proposals from anyone which show how Irish Water could potentially ever meet the arms-length borrowing test of EUROSTAT. Let us hear no more of the nonsense that water services will be deprived of funding unless current policy continues. That is a key point. If one looks at the financial framework of the Fine Gael party or any party over the next five years, they envisage Irish Water funding on-balance sheet, not off-balance. That is something that has been confirmed to us in more recent times. The entire case for Irish Water and the investment figures published have been based on putting spin first. Far more time and money has been spent on co-opting the support of commentators than on ensuring the policy stands up to scrutiny. In the context of the speeches of Deputy Coveney and others, we must make the general point as well that in the decade prior to the establishment of Irish Water, from 2000 to 2010, €5.5 billion was invested in water services and more money was spent per annum on water infrastructure in the three years prior to the establishment of Irish Water than in the years since. One should not get me wrong as there are significant challenges and considerable needs for investment but it never was simply the idea, which Irish Water fostered, that nothing was done, everything was in a medieval state for decades and hey presto!, in a magical moment, one created a new body and everything changed wonderfully. Members talk about sewage outflows, etc. One of the biggest sewage treatment projects ever was carried out 20 years ago by the two local authorities in Cork - I refer to the main drainage system going out to the wastewater treatment plant in Little Island. Many mythologies grew up about investment too and we need to be realistic about all of that and stop trying to sell the idea that everything was a disaster beforehand and everything will be fantastic afterwards. As we all know, that is not the way life works. Conservation and quality are core objectives for water policy, and this is where the funding and the priority should have been rather than on constructing a metering and charging regime which is profoundly wasteful. There should have been a cost-benefit analysis before €500 million was poured into the ground. By Irish Water's own estimation, the fixing of elements of the supply system is the single most important element of conservation and quality improvement. On the matter of charges specifically, we believe there is no basis for asking the Irish people to pay a regressive direct charge which is, at present, marginal to achieving conservation and quality objectives. At present, Irish Water's net revenue is something below €50 million, if one takes account of the water conservation grant of €100 million and the 61% compliance. There is no significant current revenue coming in at all under the existing model. Unlike others, our position is that one does not get to pick and choose what lawful payments one makes. What is lawfully owed should be paid. It is up to us, as democrats, to use legitimate democratic means to change policies. This is exactly what I have said repeatedly when questioned on this topic, before, during and after the election. On the issue of a constitutional referendum on public ownership, we are fully supportive of a stand against privatisation. There is, however, a need for all advocating such a referendum to explain how it would work, for example, how would it be proposed to give constitutional status to a service which is not universal and to water services not provided directly by State agencies. We have had enough of water policy being made up on the hoof by the outgoing Government that we do not need to spend years on something which is all about soundbites over substance. Clearly, detailed work would be required in exploring such an option. In the meantime, moving Irish Water on to a pathway to effectively become a State agency is the most effective and pragmatic way of copper-fastening the public ownership issue. Nobody here has been given a mandate to dictate policy or to tell others what their mandate represents. We have heard too much of that in recent weeks. The legitimate place for the future of water policy to be settled is here in Dáil Éireann. The talks that we are engaged in which are not yet concluded provide effectively for that. We are not denying anybody any inputs. The fundamental point is that the future of water policy will be decided, not by the policies of the previous Dáil but the inputs of this Dáil and all parties through an Oireachtas committee that is proposed to be formed subsequent to a commission's recommendations. That means, effectively, that water charges, only after they are suspended by legislation, can only ever come back by the will of the Dáil, and given that a majority of the members of this Dáil have been elected on a position of opposition to water charges, there are fairly clear implications from all of that. What we have been trying to do is to deal with this decisively in advance of the formation of a minority Government so that it, in the public interest - the public wants a Government formed - has some chance of dealing with the major issues of this country without being consistently undermined by an issue that would not be resolved in advance of its formation. We are an opposition party that will facilitate the formation of that Government but we want to ensure it has some chance of sustainability in the future. Let us first do what should have been done five years ago, that is, have an independent report on key elements of water policy. Let us then debate it. Those who believe that the current model of provision and funding is the only possible way can make their case and let them seek to persuade others and the Irish people. We welcome the fact Fine Gael acknowledges the new reality and may agree to a suspension of charges. It would be free to argue and vote for the recommencement of charges after the suspension and, equally, we and others would be free to argue and vote for the non-imposition of charges during this Dáil term. I would encourage other Deputies to put aside their fake outrage and distorting spin for the rest of this debate. The policy we are committed to remains a scrapping of the commercial State firm, no charges for at least the duration of this Dáil and a major national investment programme in developing this public service.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	271	I wish to share time with Deputy Brady. I will start by assuring Deputy Micheál Martin that any outrage expressed by me will be nothing less than genuine. Imagine the scene in a seaside town, families strolling on the beach and children and adults alike engaged in various water activities. If it was a sunny day, this would be a hot spot for tourists and locals but what if untreated raw sewage was in those waters? What if one was swimming and could see raw sewage right beside one? Surely this could not happen in Ireland, the island where we pride ourselves on our attractive beaches and lovely coastlines. Only 30 km from here, this is a reality because it is happening in Rush. This is not breaking news. This was not even breaking news last year or the year before. The EPA's urban wastewater report has repeatedly confirmed that the practice continues in Rush and the failure to properly treat sewage can pose a risk to human health and the aquatic environment. The almost 10,000 people who live in Rush have been waiting years to be connected to the sewerage treatment scheme that serves Portrane, Donabate and Lusk. Delays to this have meant that the pumping of raw sewage into the sea is the rule rather than the exception. While money was allocated to the scheme in 2008, it is expected that work on the sewerage plant will only start in the third quarter of this year, giving a completion date of sometime in 2018 or 2019. From the allocation of the funds initially, the residents of Rush will have been waiting ten years before the work is completed. Add to that the countless years of campaigning and lobbying that went on before that. These delays on the scheme are unacceptable.If we juxtapose this heel dragging and disregard for our environment and health with the extravagant waste of public moneys on water metering, the quango that is Irish Water and the enthusiasm of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to burden working families with water charges, the community in Rush is justifiably angry about it. While Irish Water has been quick to put in meters and send bills, the residents of Rush would be far better served if Irish Water focused its efforts on dealing with the major environmental issue of raw sewage being pumped into the Irish Sea. If as much time and effort were put into dealing with the countless Environmental Protection Agency reports and cases concerning compliance with the EU wastewater treatment directive as has been put into the blinkered view on water charges, the residents of Rush and the surrounding areas would have this serious blight alleviated by now. I guess pumping raw sewage into our seas is not as important as squeezing a few bob out of hard-pressed families. Water charges are a major issue for families and communities across the State. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to express their views. People voted on the issue in huge numbers only two months ago. Their direction was clear: water charges need to go. Last night on "Prime Time", Deputy Dara Calleary said, "We want to see Irish Water completely reformed." Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are talking about establishing an independent commission to examine Irish Water and the retention of the charging regime. This is not good enough. They are tinkering with a totally failed enterprise as part of their political play acting. They have no plans to replace it. The phrase, "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet", springs to mind. The deal being cooked by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil smells dodgy. Temporarily suspending water charges is not abolition. Sinn Féin's mandate is to abolish Irish Water. We want an independent commission, post abolition. We want a public water utility that is enshrined in public ownership and that best serves Irish citizens, not a rehash of a broken and wasteful Irish Water model. Anything less is unacceptable. The starting point must be the abolition of the household water charge. Fianna Fáil is willing to consider a temporary suspension of water charges. When campaigning in the general election, due to enormous pressure and because it was being raised consistently at doorsteps across the State, Fianna Fáil changed its position and campaigned against water charges.

#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	275	Only one good thing has stemmed from the introduction of water charges, namely, the awakening and politicisation of a generation of people. Hundreds of thousands of people have mobilised since Fine Gael and the Labour Party first implemented Fianna Fáil's blueprint for water charges. We have seen a coming together of progressive forces and the formation of the Right2Change movement, which has organised some of the largest demonstrations in the history of the State, one of which took place the weekend before the general election. In February, the people decided to elect more than 90 Deputies with a mandate to scrap water charges and Irish Water. They do not have a mandate to reform Irish Water or water charges, as some in Fianna Fáil would lead us to believe. It appears some little grubby deal has been done by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, pushing the issue down the road to allow Fianna Fáil to support Deputy Enda Kenny's return as Taoiseach. Last week, 39 Deputies submitted a motion to end Irish Water and water charges. The fact that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael again colluded by preventing a vote on the motion to abolish the charges and Irish Water tells a tale. The House should have acted on the mandate it received and put the issue to bed here today, once and for all. The State has forcefully pursued Irish Water's agenda with gardaí and private security firms in tow. Last year, across the State, more than 188 ordinary citizens were arrested for opposing the installation of water meters, some of which were being installed by companies with friends in very high places. On 14 April, 14 people were arrested in Wicklow town for peacefully protesting against the roll-out of the water metering programme, which is costing more than €540 million. At the protest, not unlike many others, more than 15 gardaí were present, acting as a private security firm for a private company. Last year, in a similar protest in Wicklow town, a force of more than 30 gardaí arrested 17 people. The irony is that due to Garda cutbacks, Wicklow town has no community garda and yet resources are being squandered to protect Denis O'Brien. Would those resources not be better spent protecting communities from the crime gangs that are terrorising and murdering people in all our communities? Would it not be better to stop raiding the limited resources local authorities have in order to hand them over to Irish Water to install meters? The evidence indicates that the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges was more about privatisation than conservation. Water meters and charges do not encourage conservation. Investing in the water sector, reducing the unacceptably high percentage of leaks and introducing water harvesting and dual flush systems as part of building regulations would guarantee conservation. Would it not make sense to invest in infrastructure and fix the leaks that are resulting in over 40% of water being lost, rather than installing water meters that will, ultimately, become redundant? The electorate has spoken. People have said they do not want water charges or Irish Water. We do not need a commission of experts to be established to examine issues such as alternative charging systems. A panel of experts, namely, the Irish people, has already given its report. They will not be fooled by any grubby little deal which kicks the issue of water charges down the road in order to return Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach. The mandate they gave to the majority of Deputies is to totally scrap water metering, Irish Water and water charges. I ask the Minister of State to stop criminalising entire communities by stopping the roll-out of the water metering programme immediately.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	276	I would like to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Regina Doherty.  I have always believed a single utility and a charging mechanism are crucial for us to adequately address the deficits in the provision of a quality water and waste water treatment system. As a former councillor, I have seen first hand how the system whereby 34 local authorities had responsibility for water infrastructure did not work. There are estates in south Kildare where raw sewage flows out on the green areas. Some of this has been resolved recently, and some of it is about to be resolved by Irish Water. Before Irish Water, due to the limited resources of Kildare County Council and the devolved grants it was waiting for from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, all it could manage to do was to pay for very expensive tankering, which never addressed the underlying system and was throwing good money after bad. In a short time, Irish Water is getting to grips with these issues and bringing about solutions much faster and for less money, due to the economies of scale of a bigger entity. Irish Water has delivered 34 new treatment plants, of which eight are for drinking water and 26 for wastewater. Not enough discussion about Irish Water has been about the wastewater element. Irish Water has delivered 73 upgrades, comprising 22 drinking water and 51 wastewater. It has completed 47 water conservation projects with 452 km of pipe remediated. The impact on people's health and quality of life was a key motivation in changing how we manage our water and wastewater infrastructure. Irish Water has removed 20,000 people from long-term boil water notices and 300,000 people from the EPA's remedial action list.As a result of the extent of the customer-side leakage that has been identified through metering and the first-fix repair system, it is estimated that a saving of 34 million litres of water is being made each day. This is the equivalent of the entire daily demand for water in County Wicklow. The future of Irish Water and of the charging mechanism has come under serious scrutiny as a result of the outcome of the recent general election. We have a very changed Dáil on foot of the election result. No one party can claim victory, or claim to have received a full mandate. Some Deputies in this House have cherrypicked certain issues from their pre-election promises while ignoring others. A new way of doing business comes with a new Dáil. The days when a Government could drive through its own agenda, having been elected to do so, are gone. Instead, we have a more empowered Parliament, in which consensus will be the name of the game. If and when a Government is formed, Opposition Deputies will need to be aware that life in opposition will have changed utterly. Although the days of grandstanding and populism alone will have gone, I expect plenty of that behaviour to continue. Responsibility will have to be shown in opposition in a more consensus-driven Dáil. The Deputies who want to abolish Irish Water may well get an opportunity to determine the future of the entity and the charging mechanism through the proposed Dáil committee, but they will also have to suggest how best to address the 950,000 households that have paid their charges to date and how best to treat business people, farmers, people in group water schemes and people with private wells and septic tanks. If the Deputies in question think they can go back to the old system, an inequitable feature of which was that some people paid for water and waste water services while others did not, they can think again. They will have to come off the fence and set out where the money will come from, if domestic charges are abolished, to provide the investment of €1.4 billion that is needed between now and 2021. They can decide through the proposed new budgetary committee whether the health budget or the housing and homelessness budget should be sacrificed to come up with the money that is needed to modernise our water and waste water infrastructure. Maybe they will repeat the mistakes of the past by deciding not to invest enough money in the treatment of water and waste water. This Dáil term will see a more powerful Parliament. Over the last 60 days, we have witnessed more people expressing a desire to be in opposition than trying constructively to form a Government. Those who think they can sit comfortably on the fence on the Opposition benches need to be put on notice that their populism and their soundbites regarding Irish Water will be put to the test. I look forward to availing of the proposed process to continue to advocate for a single entity to manage this country's water services. That entity should be funded properly so that it can drive the investment that is needed. I look forward to a process that will call out the bluffers and the spin doctors who tell us we can have everything for nothing. I hope for a debate in which the facts will dominate and help to inform public opinion.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	277	As a nation, we have been held to ransom over the last six or seven weeks. We have been discussing an issue that seems to have been the subject of discussion for the last three years. I suggest this is a testament to the real need to solve this problem by tackling it head-on. I welcome some of the political choices that Fianna Fáil has put to Fine Gael in the last couple of days because it has made everybody focus their minds. I will set out what I believe in this context. It has not changed in the last three years. I believe we need a single utility to manage the development and roll-out of and investment in this infrastructure, thereby providing this country with clean, good-quality drinking water from taps in kitchens and bathrooms and other locations in our homes. I believe the management of the taxpayers' money that is going into this utility system needs to ensure the best value possible is attained from this country's finite resources. I believe the management structure needs to be scrutinised by a body to ensure we get good value for money. I also believe we need to bring Irish people along with us on this journey. The overarching idea when water charges were introduced in the first instance was that this measure would make people think about the value of the water that comes out of our taps, appreciate that it is a scarce resource and accept that it costs money to get water of the best possible quality and form to come out of our taps. Maybe the way we did it was ham-fisted. We are the first people to put up our hands and say it was not done perfectly. We made mistakes and lots of them. We are now at a crossroads where we can take stock of the good and bad decisions we have made and get it right. We want a quality water system for our people. I believe a single utility is the way to go. I want our people to recognise the value of water. One of the biggest flaws in the approach that was adopted in recent years was the failure to conduct a conservation education campaign. We should have started with our children, our teenagers and our adults whose water-usage habits of a lifetime need to be changed. We should have educated people on why it is a good idea to conserve water. When we introduced the conservation grant, we should have taken the opportunity to reduce from 23% the rate of VAT that is charged on items like water butts that would allow us to conserve water. We should have had a look at the building regulations for new-builds to make sure they encourage people to be more conservative and conscious of the value of the finite resource that is water. Many people are talking about winners and losers, and about who conceded or who won. I suggest that nobody won and nobody lost. We have a window here now to reflect on what we all want for the people of this country, which is how best to provide high-quality water infrastructure from the investment that is made by taxpayers. I suggest that the whole argument about whether people should pay for water out of their left pocket or their right pocket is bizarre.

Our problem was that we were trying to reduce the burden on PAYE workers and to place an even burden on everybody who uses water in this country, and not just those who go to work every day. Maybe we did not do that quite as well as we could have done. I guarantee Deputies that when I am standing here nine or 12 months from now - whenever the commission reports its findings against the backdrop of an EU directive that sets out the legislation to which this country needs to adhere - I will be advocating, as I have done for the last three years, that there should be generous allowances in our family homes and special clauses for people with particular medical conditions and for children. We can do all of that and - please God - it will be done within the commission. However, people who choose to use more than their allowances, to whom I say "fair play to you, off you go", will have to pay for that water. I refer, for example, to those who water their gardens every day of the week because they want luscious green grass and those who want to have a bath every night of the week. By contrast, those who conserve water and contribute towards the management of a finite resource will benefit from a quality investment structure in this country. We can all be part of it together. I am the first to acknowledge we have made mistakes in recent years. Lots and lots of people paid their bills. We will not argue about whether the accurate figure is 61%. I do not believe we brought those who paid their bills with us. We sort of dragged them along. People wanted to be law-abiding. Everybody needs to be law-abiding in this country. That is why I firmly believe those who have not yet paid their bills will have to do so. When we are all back here nine, ten or 11 months from now, we will be talking about the merits of charging people who use excessive amounts of water and providing a high-quality water system for every citizen of this country.

We cannot really call it a debate because there is nothing happening here. We will talk to the air and it will fizzle out at 6.30 p.m. That will be the end of it. I would like to speak about the details that are emerging in the media at the minute. I refer to the speculation about the deal that has been done between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on water charges. It has been suggested that a commission of investigation will look at a proper charging regime. This shows that Fianna Fáil is not really opposed to water charges at all. It is just using this issue as a means of making it look like it is driving a hard bargain as it negotiates going into government with Fine Gael and tries to maintain its domination of the Opposition benches. It is being clearly shown to the people of this country that this is the case. When the moment is opportune for Fianna Fáil, it will go along with whatever charging regime is decided for it by the commission. That might happen in a year or two. It could be two and a half years or whatever. We hear talk about the commission reporting in nine months, but it will probably take a number of months for the terms of reference to be established and for the commission to be agreed and to get up and running. We will hear about delays then. They will achieve their moratorium on water charging. They will probably stretch it out to 18 months or two years. Fine Gael will go along with that nicely as well. That will deal with the issue. Ultimately, we will come back to the imposition of water taxes on citizens across the country. It is a fact that people are paying twice for water services. Deputy Regina Doherty referred to the "argument about whether people should pay for water out of their left pocket or their right pocket". In fact, it is being taken out of both pockets. Citizens are already paying for water and have already paid for water. As one listens to speakers on the Government benches in this House, one would think absolutely nothing was ever done with this country's water services before the establishment of Irish Water in 2014. I remind those who have spoken about the 34 plants that have been built by Irish Water that the groundwork and the preparation for all those plants was done by the local authorities over the years. The real problem with water services in this country prior to the establishment of Irish Water was that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, through the Government, constantly withheld money from the local authorities. They held up the delivery of projects at every stage of the process. Local authorities were not given the ability to deliver projects in a timely fashion. They had to wait for approval from the Government at every step along the way. The Department held everything up in that way. That was how they set out to do their business.The myth that Irish Water is a dynamic organisation delivering all of these projects is just that - a myth. The water charges it is levying on people do not even meet the cost of sending out water bills. As such, this charge is not financing water services in this country and will not do so in the future. Another myth is that this is all about water conservation. Prior to being elected to this House I worked in water services for 16 years. The only way to conserve water is through a district metering programme of the mains. Installing meters at every house will not identify where the real losses are occurring. Water wastage is being dressed up as a consumer problem in terms of citizens possibly having a bath every day or boiling their kettles more than twice a day. The vast majority of the losses in the water system occur on the mains rather than in consumer households. A proper district metering programme would correctly identify the households wherein the losses are occurring, thus enabling any necessary leaks at those households or to the mains to be repaired. That is the only way water can be conserved and savings can be achieved on water production costs across the country, thus bringing about real change. To say that the local authorities were the cause of the malaise in the water system and that Irish Water will resolve the problem is disingenuous. It is not the reality and those on the Government benches need to come to terms with that. This deal will halt the campaign against the water tax for a couple of years but that campaign will be ready to go again whenever Fianna Fáil decides to levy the charges again.

I agree with others in the House that we should have been able to speak on this issue sooner, as represented by the manner in which I voted yesterday. One of the primary reasons the establishment, governance and operation of Irish Water has been so excessively problematic is because there was not and still is not adequate and equal engagement of all parliamentarians on how to invest in and manage a mammoth systemic change to our water infrastructure. Significant mistakes were made in the past and the legacy of these mistakes looms large in the present. I expect then that our statements today will be heard and considered by the leaders and members of both negotiating teams who are attempting to form a minority Government. It is a positive development that both parties working out a process whereby Irish Water and the current funding model is to be reviewed through independent expertise and an Oireachtas committee that will be operating under the new politics rules of Dáil reform. This will then be brought before this Chamber to be voted on. No doubt there will be mobilisation, protest and other forms of citizen engagement as this process unfolds. I, of course, welcome that too. Owing to decades of under-investment by successive Governments we continue to live in a country where the water and waste water systems do not support with adequacy and sustainability the health, well-being and safety of our people, food and land. I want to outline four primary principles that I believe should be integral to how we plan for systemic change to our water infrastructure and thereby boost the wellness of our people or, as mentioned by Deputy Eamon Ryan, our connection to nature. These principles are the ones on which I stood in Dublin South-West as an Independent candidate. First, the establishment, management and operation of one national utility is the most efficient and effective way to bring our water infrastructure up to the high standard required for this and future generations. Second, this one national utility ought to be placed in public ownership through a constitutional referendum. We should never move towards a day when the natural resource of water is placed outside of the right of every citizen and resident. This can only be guaranteed, in my view, through changing our foundational legal document to ensure that the governance and operation of that natural resource remains within public ownership. I agree with Deputy Micheál Martin that it will take time to do that but it is worth us spending that time, alongside the process of a commission and an Oireachtas committee, following which the matter will then come before the Dáil. Third, as independent experts and law makers map out and implement the best way to protect, sustain and fund our water systems, a public education initiative, perhaps along the lines referred to by Deputy Regina Doherty, should be put in place so that our people can contribute to and learn from the process of systemic change as it unfolds. Fourth, our funding model for water should encourage habits of conservation of this precious natural resource and no one who cannot pay for water should have to pay for it - that being a prime principle of fairness. However, the principle of fairness does not have to contradict the principle of conservation. I am in favour of a funding model that is fair and conserves, one that encourages equality and ecology simultaneously.

#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	286	I am pleased that we are making progress on how to deal with the issue of Irish Water and water charges and in this regard are now creating a pathway to allow further progress to be made, which is what people want. The point has been made that there are other serious issues to be dealt with in this House, including the crises in housing, homelessness and in our health and mental health services. The question as to why water has taken centre stage has been asked, and rightly so. It became clear to us in our efforts to facilitate the formation of a Government that if we did not sort out the water issue prior to the formation of a Government it was going to disrupt the business of this Dáil and prevent other important business being carried out. Sinn Féin knows this but disruption and chaos is what it thrives on. Forming a Government and participating in and progressing matters was never on its agenda. It would have suited Sinn Féin to allow matters remain unresolved. Water has become an emotive issue, prompting thousands of people to take to the streets, some in protest at water charges and others in protest at the manner in which water charges were implemented and the manner in which Irish Water was constituted. This is evidenced by the number of Deputies elected to this Dáil who had campaigned against the current water regime. It must be remembered that there is not one view on how we should manage our water supply and water infrastructure, nor is there one view on whether we should charge for water or fund it entirely through the Exchequer. The point is that there are many options open to us as a country in terms of how we deal with the water issue. Each option is worthy of exploration in consultation with all Deputies and citizens and with the assistance of relevant expertise. The reason we are in the mess in which we currently find ourselves is because the outgoing Government did not consult the people or Members of this Chamber. It also did not allow for proper debate of the issue and instead rushed the legislation through by way of guillotined debate, failing to take on board any of the dissenting views in this Chamber. If we have learned anything from the manner in which the outgoing Government managed this issue it is that all views must be listened to, even those which we do not like. That goes for all sides of the House.  It is proposed to establish a commission to examine the future of water charges and Irish Water and then to establish an Oireachtas committee to examine the recommendations of that commission. The committee will comprise all-party representatives and Independents and will report its findings to the Dáil, at which time every Deputy will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the matter and to vote on it. Every view will be listened to. This is a good idea. I believe it will help to progress matters and I fail to understand how any Deputy could be against that. Coming from a rural constituency where many people already pay for water either through a group water scheme or through provision of their own water supply via a well at their own expense, I want to see equity at the centre of water provision in this country. We cannot forget those people. If water provision is to be funded through general taxation then those who provide their own water or pay into group water schemes must get something back. This has to be considered by any commission or Oireachtas committee. The other option is that everybody pays something, although I accept there are some people who cannot afford to pay, in respect of which Deputy Regina Doherty made some very interesting points. I take on board that there is a need to upgrade our infrastructure, to modernise how we manage our water supply and to consider the huge cost and expertise required to remove waste water.This is going to require considerable investment and is something into which every Deputy needs to have an input.  I was never in favour of having a semi-State company. I fully support the establishment of a single public utility to be owned by the people that could not be privatised and would be subject to proper oversight by the Dáil and the Seanad. I take very seriously the need to promote water conservation, the need to be mindful of the impact water has on the environment and the fact that it is a very precious resource. These issues have to be taken on board by a commission or an Oireachtas committee. We need to recognise that this is a new Dáil with a clear mandate. The current water regime is hated by the public. It lacks credibility and the public want it gone. We cannot ignore this and must go back to the drawing board. The suspension of water charges would allow us the space to regroup and see how we wanted to progress as a country. In contrast to Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin has refused to engage in Government formation and is happy to take the easy road, sitting in opposition and sniping from the sidelines. The only problem it has with the current proposal is that it would not facilitate disrupting the Dáil further. Fianna Fáil is committed to giving practical effect to its manifesto, facilitating a stable minority Government and ensuring the country is given the leadership it requires to tackle the challenges it faces. We are committed to ending the failed water regime and making sure the country has a stable Government.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	287	I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate, although with only two Members on the Government benches, I am not sure it qualifies as a debate. I am glad, however, that this issue is now being brought to a head. It is an important issue but by no means the most important. The amount of airtime it has received in recent weeks has been disproportionate. Other matters such as health, education, transport, energy, broadband and housing are huge issues that have suffered owing to the inordinate focus placed on water provision in the set-up of this Dáil. Nonetheless, it is an important issue, one that has united and divided both this House and the wider public. Let us be clear that Irish Water and the water model used have been a catastrophe from start to finish. I am not going to pre-empt what may or may not emerge this evening, tomorrow or in the coming days based on media reports on how a minority Government might be put in place and what might stem from this. If it is accepted, as appears likely, that the Irish Water model is considered a failure - that is acknowledged at this stage on all sides - it may be a sign of things to come in a minority Government. On some issues the Government will win, on others it will lose. Would we be in this mess if more than a few hours had been dedicated to the issue when it came before the Dáil, if the legislation had not been railroaded through and if a proper, full and frank debate had been allowed, with credence and time being given to opposing views? In the turbulent and tempestuous five year period of the last Government the debate on Irish Water marked one of only two occasions on which the entire Opposition walked out of the Dáil Chamber en masse. However, I wish to be constructive and acknowledge some basic facts. Let us learn from our mistakes. I recognise that water is a scarce resource and have no difficulty in principle with putting in place a mechanism to fund water services. I wholeheartedly support investment in the water network and endorse any measure that encourages or incentivises the conservation of water. I believe the majority of the people accept this and value the resource. I am not opposed to water charges in principle, but I am virulently opposed to waste, incompetence and the abject failure to tackle the underlying problems. In an effort to be constructive, rather than considering all of the problems of the past and pouring oil over the coals of the previous system, I would like to consider what a functional water system would contain. A functioning water system should reward and incentivise conservation. Any form of charging regime should be based on excessive usage rather than basic consumption. A metered but flat-rate charging system, as we now have, appears to be the worst of both worlds. The cost has been borne of installing meters, but none of the savings in actually using them for any monitoring conservation programme has been gained. A fair water services system should be based on the ability to pay. The most fundamental concept in any charging regime is that progressive charges should be based on one's means. That is contained in every piece of economic legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil in the past 50 years, but this is completely lacking from the Irish Water model under which flat rates are levied regardless. A fair water charging system should include allowances based on medical need, family size, family stage, life stage and basic usage parameters. A mother of six children or a sufferer of Crohn's disease should not be assessed in the same category as a single person with no health conditions. A functioning water system should invest more in the network, not less than was invested prior to charges being introduced. The idea that a dedicated new utility which has introduced a charging model and begun collecting charges would actually plan to spend less on the network after it was set up summarises the entire fiasco. The Fianna Fáil Government in 2010 spent more on the network than was projected to be spent by Irish Water in 2015 when charges were being levied. That is the ultimate paradox. A functioning water services system should recognise the different challenges faced by urban and rural dwellers and work with both to achieve appropriate outcomes. Group water schemes and those with their own wells should be accommodated and served just as efficiently as those living in urban estates. In north west Kildare last night I attended a meeting at which I heard that the members of Ballina group water scheme had been told they would have to wait a minimum of ten years before receiving priority from Irish Water. Why are they at the back of the queue? A functioning water services system should be capable of dealing with issues such as private and public property, easements, wayleaves and accessing property when repairs need to be made. That is another basic technical issue that it has not been possible to overcome and has further complicated the entire model.  A functioning water services system should not operate as a quango, with wanton waste, excess and an incompetent manner to lose more money than it has made, giving free money to people via a conservation grant paid without any link to the need for conservation or compliance. This is the first tax in history which has actually resulted in a loss of money, where the money collected though the charge does not even cover the cost of bringing it in.  A functioning water services system should be introduced following more than a token debate in the House. It should be subject to scrutiny, governance, oversight and the considered input of all groups and interested parties inside and outside the House and only rolled out following agreement on same. This is too important to get wrong. The people deserve better.

I pose the following questions to the two Ministers present from the caretaker Government. Why were water charges such an issue? Why did they dominate political discourse for so long? Why were they such an issue in the election campaign? Why was water provision the issue that spooked both Fine Gael and the Labour Party over and over again into making mistake after mistake? Why did water charges force the party of water charges, Fianna Fáil, which had signed the State up to implementing them in the first place with the troika in the memorandum of association, to eventually change its position for electoral gain? It was all to do with people power. The people rose up. They had had enough and saw water charges as a tipping point. Right across the State, in every town, village, community and almost every housing estate, the people rose up and marched in their tens of thousands against water charges. They saw them in terms of all the nasty, mean cuts made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil before them. They came with all of the cuts made to social welfare payments and community services, all of the taxes brought forward and all of the damage done to pay back the bondholders, banks and property speculators. It was fantastic to be part of the Right2Water movement and march in protest with senior citizens, young people and children in a family-friendly atmosphere at rallies and protests. It was fantastic to see people from working class communities from all over the State coming together to say "No" to the charges because they knew that they were unfair and unjust. That is why Fine Gael and the Labour Party were spooked and why Fianna Fáil changed its position. Deputy Lisa Chambers spoke about Sinn Féin sitting on its hands. We have heard this all the time from Fianna Fáil in the past few weeks. The reality is that when we were out on the streets standing shoulder to shoulder with trade unionists and people from communities across the State, there was no one there from Fianna Fáil. It sat on its hands and abandoned these communities when they needed support. It cynically used the issue of water charges as a pawn in a game. That is all it means to it. It is not sincere or genuine.

The reality, which everyone in this Chamber needs to realise, is that water charges are politically dead and should be given a burial here. We do that by introducing legislation to abolish domestic water charges and Irish Water and holding a referendum on public ownership. A motion has been signed by 39 Deputies but not one member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael has signed it. Why not? It is because they are not interested in dealing with the issue.

We have said we could not make such a commitment to pay back those who have paid if and when water charges are abolished. We said that because we believed at the time the money was not there. We welcome the fact the Minister for Finance has said today that there is increased scope in terms of the fiscal space. In that context, we are willing to look at such a proposal to see if it is viable to refund those who have paid their water charges to date. There is a responsibility on everyone in the Chamber to stop playing games on the issue of water charges.

The people had their day and their say on 26 February. Despite what the Government said over and over, water charges were the single issue that mobilised, ignited and rallied the Irish people. They were the single issue that ignited the spirit of protest and the determination to fight back in the Irish people, something we have not seen in decades. This was because the unfairness of the Government's austerity policies was obvious to everyone except the Government. The people knew from the very start that Irish Water was a toxic entity. The people knew they were already paying for water through progressive taxation and that they were already paying their PAYE, PRSI, USC, motor tax, local property tax, toll charges, bin charges, accident and emergency charges and many more. While they were paying these taxes, they could see that the Government had cut many public services to the bone. They also knew that the water tax was just another austerity measure against the working man and woman and those who could least afford to pay. They saw that the Government bulldozed ahead regardless. How wrong it was. It did not break the backs of the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets and mobilised themselves in every town, city and village across the State. In my own county of Louth, in Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee, thousands mobilised. It should be clear that any attempt to fudge this issue by a short-term suspension or the setting up of a commission whereby a Government and those propping it up seek to have a majority to put a veto on abolishing Irish water will not be tolerated.

Unfortunately, there is not enough pressure on and that is the reality of this situation. I remember being in Carrick-on-Shannon three years ago when the water charge protests were going on. There were a couple of thousand people there, the vast majority of whom were on group schemes in Leitrim. While they were protesting about Irish Water, they were also protesting about SNAs being taken out of schools, about relatives who were unable to get hospital appointments and against all the austerity measures the Government had introduced over many years. They were really protesting about the right-wing conservative attitude of the two main parties which wanted to bring us down a road where people pay their taxes for services and then have to take out their chequebooks and pay again. That is the reality of what people have protested about. That is the symbolism that the water charge protest was. There is another symbolism coming up in the next couple of days. If the two parties of the right in this Chamber come together and create a fudge on Irish Water, it will be clear that nothing has changed. The symbolism will be clear that the old ways of the conservative past will be brought back again. That is what people are watching out there. They are watching to see exactly what will happen. Will the change they voted for on 26 February come into being or not? That is really what the water charges issue is about. If one wants to show the people that one is going to listen to them, one must abolish Irish Water and extinguish water charges.

I would have thought I would have seen a little humility and a hands-up acknowledgement of the mistakes made and the debacle of Irish Water as clearly outlined by various Deputies, in particular Deputy Smith who outlined the money that has gone into the ground. I am bemused, even though this is so serious, at Deputy Martin coming in and saying he sought this debate today. While I am particularly fond of some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, one or two of whom are my colleagues, I find, as the Irish phrase goes, tá siad ag caint mar Thadhg an dá thaobh. The last speaker from Fianna Fáil said that, in principle, he is not against water charges while Deputy Lisa Chambers said she is willing to look at all options. They cannot have it every way. What we have today is a solution that beggars belief. We are going to have the equivalent of a water birth in nine months. We will have a pregnancy and a water birth and we will see what child emerges. It will be a changed Irish Water or a new Irish Water but still an Irish Water. It seems to me we are missing the point completely but it has been outlined by other Deputies. The people of Ireland have spoken. I take particular exception to the way the Minister denigrates anyone who wishes to speak out or articulate a different vision. We are not negative. If the Government was seriously interested, as we were in Galway city, it would have looked at our example down there. We led the whole campaign on recycling. Despite all advice from engineers, we reached a 70% recycling rate and diversion from landfill. With the introduction of charges, which were unfortunately championed by the Green Party, the people were punished. Then, the service was privatised. That was exactly what was on the cards for Irish Water and it still is. That follows a model where we demonise people and decide we have to punish them. Indeed, Deputy Zappone has talked about an education programme. That education programme would have to start with us in the Dáil where I have not seen a single sign for conservation. I have not seen a single mechanism for conservation of water in the toilets. That education programme must start with us in the first instance and then encompass the service sector. I am staying in a hotel for this period of time and I have not seen a single sign for conservation or anything like it, nor have I seen a grant given to any ordinary person for conservation of water. That tells me that there is a lack of seriousness about conserving water. In my 16 years on a local authority I saw it starved of funds in the first instance and staff in the second. I take exception to the claim that we did not do our job. We did. In Galway city we had cryptosporidium, from which, unfortunately, I suffered. A risk assessment was carried out, but this was never made known to councillors and no funding was made available until after people had got sick. We identified the problems. The 7,000 people living Carraroe cannot drink their water until the end of the year. Irish Water will be taken to the courts in May by the Environmental Protection Agency. The utility to which we have entrusted responsibility for water provision is being taken to court, not over what happened in Carraroe but because of its failure elsewhere. I would like to work with whatever Government is in power because it is vital that we conserve water, but we must do so in a positive way. We must work with people and show example. We should not proceed with a divide and conquer approach. Fianna Fáil Deputies mentioned people with Crohn's disease. Are we going to take the route of divide and conquer, depending on whether people are disabled, or are we finally going to realise a civilised society must have basic services for which we must pay through taxation? These services are housing, health, public transport and water, for which we are paying. The Minister was contemptuous in claiming that we were not already paying for them. He is asking us to pay on the double. I will happily support the motion to get rid of Irish Water. That motion should be put to the House. We should conclude the charges and hold a referendum on the issue.

I congratulate all water campaigners around the country who in the past two and a half or three years stood up to be counted. Hundreds of thousands of people went out onto the streets. Community campaigners, anti-metering protestors and those who fought Irish Water on every street and estate and in every village, town and city stood up to be counted. They also stood up to the political parties. People power has won its first victory against water charges. Those involved have forced the political parties to retreat. The emerging deal - a fudge - is the first victory as the Government and Fianna Fáil have been forced to back down, but they did not do so voluntarily. They did it under the pressure exerted by people power. A word of caution to everyone involved in the campaign: he or she should stay organised and continue to resist metering. The political parties are treacherous and may attempt to reintroduce water charges. Today's bad tempered rant by the caretaker Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, may be an indication of what is to come. If we stay organised and continue to resist metering, however, water charges will be dead and buried. As we have said from the beginning, water charges are unjust and represent double taxation. They were the straw that broke the camel's back among people who had been devastated by austerity, in particular low and middle income families. A motion on the Order Paper that has been signed by 39 Deputies calls for the abolition of water charges and the enshrining in the Constitution of the public ownership of water infrastructure. It should be debated urgently, but, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil has agreed with Fine Gael to prevent that from happening. I appeal to Fianna Fáil, the Members of which where elected on a pledge to end water charges, to allow the motion to be tabled and voted on, as there is a majority in the House in favour of abolishing water charges. Irish Water must be abolished as it has been a disaster for ordinary people. We must also ensure the many people who paid their water charges under duress - the elderly people who were afraid and people who were ill and worried certainly did not pay voluntarily - will have their money refunded. It is important that the legislation underpinning domestic water charges is repealed. I appeal to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to allow the motion on the Order Paper to be debated and voted on so as to put water charges and Irish Water to bed once and for all.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	313	It is eight years since the economic crash, an event of such magnitude that it was supposed to herald new ways of doing the State's business and for a while it did. The two largest parties in the State at the subsequent general election agreed to form a Government and negotiated a programme for same within one week. They worked together for five difficult years to ensure Ireland's economic recovery. As the publication of the stability programme update, SPU, attests, they brought us to a place where we could for the first time in seven years confidently plan for our future. It was said the most recent election result replaced old politics with new politics. It did nothing of the sort. What we have witnessed in the past 60 days is self-interest over national interest, old politics at its very worst, the kind of politics that led us into the economic crash in the first place. The establishment of Irish Water was not conceived to be popular. As the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government stated, it had its origins in a Fianna Fáil commitment to the troika to establish such a utility. That commitment waived our derogation from water charges under the wastewater directive, but it was also the right thing to do. We all know that our water and wastewater treatment systems have not been fit for purpose for decades. They are certainly not fit for the challenges we face in the 21st century in a modern, First World economy, the people in which are entitled to clean and decently treated water and the protection of groundwater. Historically, water provision has been underfunded. It does not have the same visibility as the factors that compete in my Department for scarce funding: schools, hospitals, houses, day care centres and so on. Who can envisage in a competition with new cancer wards or children's facilities sewage treatment facilities ever coming top of the list? We all know this and it has gone on for decades.The utility model addressed this issue by allowing Irish Water access to non-Exchequer funds. That was the idea behind it. As with the ESB and Bord Gáis Energy, it was to be a commercial company that could access funds that would not be on the State’s balance sheet and invest the billions of euro needed to bring our wastewater treatment and water supply infrastructure up to normal European standards. A successful market corporation test was not impossible and was actually achievable. EUROSTAT stated "No", but the Central Statistics Office, CSO, stated "Yes". In my experience - I am around quite a while, as the Chairman knows - this was the first time EUROSTAT had actually overruled the CSO, which, basically, is the Irish subset of the European statistics body. If we had been given the okay by EUROSTAT, we would have had even greater access to cheaper funding. Owing to the improvements we set out this morning in the SPU, we can now borrow as a State, at a rate of less than 1%. State bodies and companies such as the ESB share the benefits of this low interest rate because of Ireland’s success. If what I read in the newspaper is true, water provision is now to compete once again with other pressing demands for funding. As I stated, in a competition between a cancer ward and a sewage treatment plant what will lose out? Treatment plants and investment in water systems have no prospect of being successful. It is understandable that the imposition of domestic water charges following a period of very painful fiscal consolidation was going to be unpopular. The public was fortunate that Fianna Fáil was not in a position to proceed with its planned annual household charge of €400, but it did take us some time to get the model right. We did act too swiftly because of the pressure exerted on us by the troika. I can attest to this at first hand because I had to meet representatives of the troika every three months to go through our scorecard with them before they released the money to pay pensions and make social welfare payments and meet public sector pay bills. Every three months we awaited the troika’s scrutiny and oversight as we lost domestic control over our own finances. Consider the water charges we have in place, despite all the rhetoric. I listened to statements about the calamitous imposition on ordinary people. God knows, there have been calamitous impositions on them in recent years, the most egregious being the loss of 300,000 jobs and the sending of 100,000 people abroad. That was calamitous. To put it bluntly, a charge of €3 a week on a household does not fit into that category. I am not, however, wedded to the system. We could make further adjustments. We should give households a generous allowance and charge only for water wasted or abused. However, what is now being discussed is dishonest. If charging is abandoned, it will be gone for good. The law-abiding citizens who paid the charges, whether they agreed with them or not, and who accepted the law of the land will be penalised for their loyalty. It would be a poor lesson in a country that drove itself to the brink of viability a few short years ago by pursuing short-term opportunities over long-term planning. It is no accident that this is being driven by the same party that was responsible for the economic catastrophe out of which the country has now crawled its way painfully. If the lesson we should have learned from the economic crisis was to think long term and reduce the temptation to court popularity at the cost of the nation’s long-term needs, it is amazing how quickly we have unlearned it. Deputy Micheál Martin, above all others in this House, knows that well. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, told the House today that water charges, under the draft agreement being put together by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, would be put on hold. He knows the truth of that statement. Everybody in the House knows it. “On hold” means "finished and abandoned". It is a policy that I know runs contrary to the views of every Fine Gael front bencher. How do I know that? I know it because they told me so trenchantly for the past five years. It has been our policy as a Government to do the right thing. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and I guaranteed each other on the first day we held our seals of office that we would do the right thing, even if it was not the easy thing to do. An election should not change that fundamental principle.

There is a saying that if one always does what one always did, one always gets what one always got. Today may mark the end of repeating behaviours and policies that simply have not worked. The comments of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, on the immaturity of the approach of my party to this issue and his description of it as national sabotage indicate that while others might have grasped the need to step back and reassess where we are, he certainly has not. It could have been so different. The establishment of Irish Water had the potential to be as groundbreaking as the establishment of the ESB. However, from the moment it was established, by a guillotined debate in the Dáil and denying the opportunity to discuss amendments or engage in serious in-depth consideration of its remit, to the moment when the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, threatened to punish non-payers through the reduction of their water supply to a trickle the die was cast. Like other Deputies, I fought the local elections in 2014. It was apparent even then, or from those early days in the history of Irish Water, that there were real and genuine fears among all classes of people about the scale of the charges that would face them and the scale of the bills they might have to pay. It could have been so different. The allowances for children and households were adjusted and readjusted continually. There were to be no allowances for teenagers over 18 years. This alone
struck fear into the hearts of parents of college-going children, or those living at home, who had genuine fears about the bills that would come through their doors. By that stage, the debate had been lost, but the Government ploughed on relentlessly, ignoring the fact that there were people who wanted to pay but who simply could not afford to do so because their finances were so tight. There were no allowances ever made to reflect their ability. It could have been so different. By the time the Government parties had finished, there had been a dozen or so U-turns, from the suspension of water charges for one year in 2014 to the replacement of other planned initiatives with the water conservation payment. I could run my tap from one end of the year to the next and still claim my conservation grant, yet the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, spoke about sabotage and immaturity. Not only that, I could run my tap day in and day out, wash my car every day, have a swimming pool in my back garden, if I could afford it, and at the same time completely disregard my neighbour who might be making painstaking efforts to conserve water. Where is the intelligence in that kind of regime? Where is the justice in it? It could have been so different. The Government could have had a long lead-in period in the charging for water and educating people, beginning with children in primary school, about the necessity to protect and conserve a finite resource.Instead, we had children participating in marches with their parents and writing the right to water principle into their 2016 proclamations, yet the Minister lectures us about sabotage. It could have been much different if a metering charging regime had been based on people's abuse rather than use of water.  Tax incentives for domestic water harvesting measures and enhanced building regulations requirements in respect of water could have been introduced. In Massachusetts, for example, one of the latest building regulations requires home designers and builders to design hot water systems that deliver hot water to taps in less than 15 seconds, potentially saving millions of gallons of water annually. How long must we wait for hot water to arrive from the moment we switch on our tap?  The Government was stubborn in the face of the most objective opposition. Irish Water workers had to face into protest after protest from people, many of whom had never participated in a protest in their lives or felt a need to do so. Whole sections of society have become actively politicised by the water charges issue. Perhaps I will have another opportunity to discuss those who claim to be the champions of the anti-water charges cause. As the Minister may be aware, meters have not been installed in half of my constituency. How did he intend to have meters installed in the remaining parts without encountering significant opposition and protests that would require the deployment of Garda human resources that would be far better invested elsewhere in fighting crime and protecting people? The Minister describes this reasonable question as immature and argues that it could give rise to sabotage. I reiterate the comments of my party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin. Fianna Fáil is committed to a policy of scrapping the commercial State company, Irish Water, of not applying charges for at least the duration of this Dáil and of implementing a major national investment programme to develop this vital public service.

It is important that the House is debating this issue. I listened to the revisionist speech of the acting Minister, Deputy Howlin, in which he washed his hands of this issue. Irish Water was created in 2009 when the concept first appeared in the NewERA document produced by the Fine Gael Party. The birth and implementation of Irish Water were abject failures. Four water services Bills were rammed through the House and guillotined by the previous Government. We also had the farce of the introduction of a conservation grant of €100. As Deputy Lahart stated, the grant had nothing to do with conservation and was introduced to bribe people to participate in a model that would never work. All of us agree that we must conserve water, a highly valuable resource. People have jumped on the bandwagon in recent years and used this issue for political gain. When one is in a hole, however, one should stop digging. Now that a stop has been put to water charges, we can examine the current model, including the ownership of water. I was the leader of the Opposition in the previous Seanad, which passed a motion calling for a referendum to ensure ownership of water remained with the people in perpetuity. Irish Water was established using a model that did not reflect the advice the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government received from independent consultants. Under the structure chosen, the company could be privatised and sold on at some point in future. Irish people are intelligent and saw that was the case.  Irish people are also intelligent enough to realise that Sinn Féin was scared into pretending to campaign against water charges when it lost the by-election in Dublin South-West more than two years ago. I read with interest Sinn Féin's manifesto for the Assembly elections in the North. When one discounts the five blank pages, the document extends to 24 pages, of which two and a half are devoted to the party's priorities for government in the North. The manifesto does not contain a single reference to water because Sinn Féin in the North charges people for water and applies a property tax.  The fundamental problem with the water charges and property taxes is that ability to pay is not taken into account. The water charges are not a conservation measure but a tax and people view them as such. At this stage, it is important to suspend water charges and try to find a better model to improve water infrastructure. I watched with interest a recent "Prime Time" programme which reported from Rush in my constituency where raw sewage is pumped into the sea on the north beach. That is outrageous and disgraceful. I remind Government Deputies that funding was in place for a scheme up to 2013 but the previous Government cut it and kicked on the completion date to 2018-20.  A targeted investment programme is needed, one which focuses on areas where infrastructure needs to be improved. Water charges must be suspended and a commission established to examine how the process would work in future. I am confused by Sinn Féin's stance that a commission would be a problem given that the party wanted such a commission, albeit one that would deliver exactly what it wanted. We must step back and examine what model can work properly, how local authorities can be properly funded and how water infrastructure can be properly upgraded.  This debate is welcome, as are the current moves towards the full suspension of water charges. A referendum on the ownership of Irish Water would address one of the main issues by ensuring that water remains in public ownership.

I have been paying for domestic water since 1988. I also paid to have a septic tank installed and I regularly pay to have it cleaned. My perspective on water and wastewater is that they cost money. If people want free water and wish to defecate in public, they should do so by all means. Ultimately, however, we must pay for clean water and to have waste and raw sewage treated properly. This is necessary on several grounds, both health and environmental, and all of this costs money. I would love not to have to pay ESB and broadband bills or the RTE licence fee but the harsh reality in 2016 is that domestic households and industry must pay for the services they require, including water. Water infrastructure is worth investing in and I cannot understand people who want to abolish Irish Water and scrap water charges. What exactly would abolishing a utility such as Irish Water mean? It would result in thousands of staff being made redundant, including those who take telephone calls to help consumers, workers installing badly needed new infrastructure for water and wastewater treatment plants and the staff who install water meters. During the recent general election campaign, I met subcontractors who got work from Irish Water. They were delighted to be working again. Are Deputies on the Opposition benches who argue for the abolition of Irish Water saying we should get rid of all these staff?

I was a member of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht when it was asked in 2012 to carry out an investigation into a report on the provision of water.A significant amount of work was done by that committee to establish whether we needed a water utility and the topics we reviewed were: the status of a new water utility - I remind Members that this was in 2012 - the principle of metering, metering mechanisms, charges and tariffs, water conservation, poverty proofing, outstanding water rates, North-South basis for river basin management, regulation, consumer representation, waivers, emergency planning, flooding, transparency and accountability, and I could go on. The committee produced a 148 page report which is available and which was agreed by the committee in May 2012 and published in June 2012. Deputy Ellis was one of the members of that committee-----

I could go on but the evidence is all there. We can look at the cost of putting in a system to store and treat water for people in rural areas. Does Deputy Ellis know how much that costs? Does he know how much it cost my neighbours? It costs anywhere between €4,000 and €9,000 to install a waste treatment plant. I got my water bill last week, which amounted to €140. All my neighbours received similar bills. These neighbours are looking with bewilderment at people in this country who think they should get everything for nothing. Unfortunately, that is not what happens in the real world. I would love to have everything for nothing but that is not what happens in the real world.

All around the country, people, particularly those in rural group water schemes, got together and worked to install water infrastructure in their areas. When Irish Water was set up, I felt like tearing my hair out. In the first few weeks and months of Irish Water, I found what was going on frustrating. However, bit by bit, that changed for those of us who engaged with Irish Water and attended meetings and learned of the problems around the country, particularly in places which had cryptosporidium problems for up to ten years. We worked with Irish Water and the new systems so as to ensure that within a year or 18 months new infrastructure could be installed to solve that problem. This was a step in the right direction. Everybody should know that 700 people work in Irish Water, 150 of whom came from the local authorities. Some 200 people are on contract for the metering system and they will probably have to be told now they no longer have a contract. That is the reality of what is happening now, whether right or wrong. What has been going on is a fudge. I do not mind how we pay for water, whether through tax or a payment system. However, whether we like it or not, we need to spend double the money if we are to improve treatment plants and the quality of water to the level required. I believe we should have taken the referendum route on this issue so as to ensure Irish Water could never be sold to private operators. This should have been done. Whether we want to admit it, Irish Water has made progress, but people do not want to admit that. It started out as a disaster and mistakes were made by people rolling it out who did not explain the benefits of a water meter. I know from my local group water scheme that 900 cu. m was being used before we introduced meters. On the introduction of the meters, this was reduced to 250 cu. m. Conservation has gone out the door with the fudge going on now and there is no penalty if one leaves a tap running 24 hours a day. There are 190,000 households around the country that are members of group water schemes and these people lost €45 of their subvention last year. If everyone is going to get free water, and that is fine if that is what the Dáil decides, I want to see the subvention for those on group water schemes being raised enough for them not to have to pay. If we are giving free water to everyone around the country, it is only right that happens.  Whatever is decided now, down the road in five to seven years, I believe that whether we like it or not, the European Union will slap fines on sewerage treatment plants because of raw sewage in our drainage systems. I have seen raw sewage in my own area. Let us be honest and tell people straight out that we do not have the required funds. If we are putting €240 million here and €240 million there, we will not have the money to put the infrastructure in place. Whatever decision is made now, will be for the next few years. Nobody should cod himself or herself and believe that within the term of this Dáil, water charges will return. A commission is being put in place. The Independent Alliance has received no information on what is being discussed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We do not know whether the Dáil will accept any proposal the proposed commission brings forward or whether it will be put to a vote. I would emphasise that the group water schemes were short changed last year. Conservation has now gone out the window, although this is something the group water scheme sector has promoted down through the years. We do not know now whether the money taken from people will be returned. I am concerned that in five, six or seven years, we will be in trouble as the tap can be left running now without consequence. I have no problem with paying for water, whether through taxes or a charge, but we must face reality. People do not like hearing that. Sometimes people do not like hearing the truth that water will cost money down the road, whether through taxes or not, but we must pay if we are to bring this country up to spec. I work on a group water scheme and EU specifications now are totally different from what they were ten years ago and cost a lot more money.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-04-27 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	329	Like Deputy Fitzmaurice, I work on a group water scheme. I have spent 21 years as secretary of the largest group water scheme in County Louth and believe I have good knowledge and understanding of the complexities of water supply. The issues and costs of supply, the integrity of water quality and the need to control leaks and waste go hand in hand. All in all, the supply of water does not come cheaply, whether one is part of the group scheme, an individual well owner or part of a larger local authority supply. The same can be said in regard to wastewater, whether in regard to the individual septic tank or the larger municipal treatment plant. I firmly believe that the nation's vexation and motivation in the water charge protest was not totally about water but that the water charge was the straw that broke the people's backs. They were basically crying out that enough was enough and that they had paid more than their fair share through a myriad of taxes - USC, property tax, income tax and motor tax. In return for all of that, they saw none of the moneys raised spent in their locality. The lack of services, such as poor public lighting, deteriorating road infrastructure, crumbling footpaths and so on, were the order of the day, while Irish Water was allowed to form, grow and try to empty the last few coins from the ordinary person's pocket. It is worth noting that the group scheme I referred to earlier was subsumed into a local authority in the early 2000s, when 100% grant aid was available from the European Union. These grants were freely available for the upgrading of all water schemes across the country. Many local authorities took up that challenge and did a good job in the delivery of water and waste services. I believe they should have been left in charge of those services but should also have been given the resources they need to expand and improve supply problems.I subscribe to the idea of a national plan for services but there was no need for the current structure. I firmly believe this delivery mechanism should be returned to local authorities, along with a water and waste infrastructure company which is owned by the people and is accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I look forward to the deliberation of the proposed commission to look into the structure and delivery mechanisms. I also subscribe to water metering, both bulk and individual. Such metering, however, should only come into play when an appropriate and generous allowance per household and individual allowances are determined.  We all know the saying, "You don't miss the water until the well runs dry". The day when water is a scarce commodity may be approaching faster than one expects. It is the responsibility of all Deputies to fully apprise themselves of all the issues relating to both water and waste. They should not just focus on cost but on the complex and pressing problems of water supply and its availability. We are equally required to inform our constituents honestly of these complexities. I firmly believe the commission is being set up to examine the issue and its recommendations will ultimately be debated in this House so that we can make an informed decision on how to deal with the problem of water. This was something that was not offered to the previous Dáil during the establishment of Irish Water and this angered not just politicians in this House but across the country and the public generally. If this proposal helps to free up the logjam of forming a government, then this House is doing the right thing. I support the abolition of domestic water charges but need to be fully informed on the correct and equitable mechanisms for doing so. Conservation and quality must be to the fore of any water policy and, ultimately, whether or not we have water charges for the domestic supply, it is my belief that the Exchequer will have to fund the bill at any stage.

The roots of this debacle go back to 1977 when our predecessors in this Chamber, from all parties and none, engaged in American-style auction politics. Fine Gael decided it would reduce domestic rates and car tax, so Fianna Fáil decided to top that by abolishing domestic rates and car tax. That created two things: the inability of local authorities throughout the country to operate under their own steam and undertake their own projects; and a lack of the right level of financing to do that, rather than depending on the proximity of a senior Minister in one's constituency to back projects that were needed or on population numbers, where greater priority was given to those areas where most people lived. That system of local government funding has struggled along since then and, while we would like to blame it on the troika, Fianna Fáil or the previous Government, that was what led us to where we are today and our need for enough resourcing and enough financing to undertake the works we require. There is no question but that in 1977, domestic rates required reform because in cases where a man died leaving a large family of nine children in a large farmhouse in rural Ireland, his widow would lease the land for a nominal rent while the nine children were gone to the four corners of the earth. A widow in such circumstances was rated in a very unfair way on the size of her property. We needed a fair reform of the process whereby those who could pay would pay. There should be a local authority contribution for refuse collection and water and all of those things were included at that time but since those days, the people who occupied these Houses have made a complete mess of it, collectively. Here we are today, struggling with that outcome and trying to fund everything from general taxation. I appreciate the dilemma before the Houses in respect of this issue. The establishment of Irish Water was like setting up Unilever to run a corner shop. It put the cart before the horse in a major way, a cart populated by people who were used to spending the public's money without any need to focus on where the money would come from or whether there was affordability and people had the ability to pay. We had 31 local authorities throughout the country populated with good staff who knew what schemes had to be undertaken. In my own constituency of Sligo, for example, there are three schemes known as the bundle scheme, involving Grange, Tubbercurry and Strandhill, all shovel-ready for a number of years. Instead of Irish Water and water rates bringing the project forward, it has put it into reverse. Irish Water personnel on service level agreements with Sligo County Council have the same level of expertise and know what work needs to be done but the resources are not being provided to them and any decision they make has to be laundered through some outfit in Cork before they are allowed to proceed in any way. Those three schemes are being scaled back so that if they are built, they will not be able to provide for any additional housing or business. This is in Sligo where the IDA is about to embark on a 70-acre park for industry, so we are not taking cognisance of any of those things. If we were to take the money that was spent on meters and on the establishment of Irish Water, for which there are different figures up to €750 million, and distributed that money throughout the 31 local authorities to the expertise that is there on site, how much further down the road could we be towards the €5.5 billion that we need all over the country? I am giving an example from Sligo but I am sure that this is replicated in Dublin, where we have infrastructure that is hundreds of years old, and in every village and rural area throughout the country.  If today is the day we draw a line in the sand and begin to move forward, I am glad the power over charges and structures will lie with this House and the sum of all the people of this House, whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or anybody else who ran the place effectively as a dictatorship disguised as a democracy. I welcome future debates on the issue. I do not know what is in the deal but I hope the essence of the deal is that people in this House, of whatever colour, will have the say on the future of these issues.

There have been comments from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that seemed to suggest that Sinn Féin and others have delighted in some kind of anarchy or mayhem unleashed by the water protests. Tá dhá phríomh-fhadhb le sin. First is the fact that the demands of the water charges movement and Right2Change were, in many ways, very simple - nothing extraordinary or dramatic. People wanted water to be delivered as of right, free and in a quality way. The second problem with the argument is that the water charges movement was much, much bigger than Sinn Féin or any of the other parties or political organisations that contributed to it. This movement frightened the political establishment for precisely that reason. This was a movement not led by Deputies or trade unionists but by ordinary mothers, fathers and neighbours on the back of remarkable local solidarity. Whatever success this movement has met with has been due to them. We will see what is going to emerge from negotiations between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on their proxy programme and what the outcome will be of the commission report. I am not convinced that this is the end of water charges and we may yet see their return. However, it seems likely there will be some form of suspension. I pay tribute to the people in communities who have delivered that.It was an enormous movement and effort in my city and constituency. The first estate in the State where people protested actively and regularly on their doorsteps on the water issue was Ashbrook Heights in Togher, only a few hundred feet from where I was raised. The community effort has been remarkable, with shifts organised and everybody working together to a common objective. Neighbours pulled together. I saw this not only in numerous estates in Togher but also in Leesdale, Mahon, Ballyphehane, Passage, Carrigaline and across the constituency and Cork North-Central as well as across the county. What has worried the establishment is that these communities took power into their own hands and have said they will not take any more and will make their power count. There has been comments among the media and political figures in the last few days that they are tired and frustrated with talk about Irish Water, as if there are no other political issues. Undoubtedly, there are many issues of equal importance and, perhaps, greater urgency, such as the housing and homelessness crisis which is becoming more stark each day in my home city. However, what that commentary misses is that for many people Irish Water became a totem for those issues as well. It came to symbolise all of the wrong choices taken and the wrong priorities during the years of the crash and austerity. Do not assume that the people who protested against Irish Water and water charges and stood up for their communities are going away. If the incoming Government fails to deal with the housing crisis or the crisis in accident and emergency departments, the communities that found their courage in the last few years on the issue of water will once again hold the Government to account for its failings.

This is clearly not the case. Water quality and the structure required for it are simply based on investment. The source of that investment is not the key determinant of the quality of the water or the quality of the infrastructure. He identified the massive problems within that infrastructure, including the boil notices in Roscommon and the effluent flowing into the sea. However, what he identified was the legacy of under-investment by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Those problems exist today due to the fact that those two parties have not invested in the infrastructure. The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly also stated that if one takes the investment for Irish Water from the Exchequer it will compete with health, education and housing funding. However, health, education and housing have competed very unsuccessfully under Fine Gael and the Labour Party with cuts to the incomes of higher income earners and cuts to the USC. Those three issues are already the poor relations in the Government's investment priorities. If one seeks an insight into the Labour Party and Fine Gael's prioritisation of investment, just look at the level of investment they already give to infrastructure in the State. Ireland has one of the fastest growing populations in Europe. It also has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, yet Ireland is second from the bottom with regard to infrastructural capital investment. That demonstrates the priority of investment with this Government. We wish to have a functioning water distribution system. If one looks at the manifestos of all of the major political parties, Sinn Féin was to the fore regarding the level of investment that would go to infrastructure and water in the coming years. Sinn Féin is the party of infrastructural investment. We have been calling for a proper debate on this issue, and a vote on a motion on it, since the election. In all of that time Fianna Fáil has frustrated us on it. It appears that it flip-flopped very recently, for strategic reasons, in its negotiations with Fine Gael. That should not be the case. The debate should be on the basis of democratic mandate alone. The reason the Dáil has been in democratic lock-down for the last 61 days and the reason that Fianna Fáil has failed to allow this debate is that it is seeking wriggle room with regard to any U-turns it needs to make in its negotiations with the Government. That should not be the case. The issue of democratic mandate and how it affects the Dáil should be primary.

They were soundly rejected on the streets and in our communities for months before that but the main parties, despite their spin, refused to recognise this complete and indisputable rejection. Hundreds of thousands marched in our towns and cities, organised locally and protested against water meters being forced on their communities with the help of gardaí and private security firms, who harassed and bullied local people and took photographs of the people where they lived. People are still being arrested for protesting peacefully on the streets outside their homes. The people's opposition has not stopped and will not stop. What political leadership has given the organic development of the anti-water charges movement is clear. Communities have risen up. People power is evident and it is not going away. Even many who voted for the Government are disgusted by the waste of money that is Irish Water. It has already cost the Irish people hundreds of millions of euro, all while much of the water infrastructure of the State is leaking and rotting in the ground before it reaches the homes of the people who have had meters installed. Money which could have done some good was squandered on consultants to develop the master stroke of naming an Irish water company Irish Water. Today, and for the last few weeks, Fianna Fáil has been trying to backtrack on what it told the people during the election. It has sought to delay charges and kick the can down the road in the hope of giving the party space once again to take some part in running the State. Delays did not work previously and they will not work now. The people did not buy the reduced charge, the delay in metering or even the ridiculous water conservation grant. They will not buy this rubbish either. If Fianna Fáil wished to keep its promise to the people it would support a vote on water charges today, and if Fine Gael had any respect for the will of the people it would facilitate that vote. However, power is always the priority with those two parties, the tweedledum and tweedledee of the gombeen political system. The people know what this is about, and they reject it. They will not be satisfied because they understand the true nature of what Irish Water represents - the thin edge of the wedge of privatisation. They know that if charges continue they will increase, waivers and grants will disappear and the human right to water will be truly commodified once and for all. We have seen this happen in Detroit where many people in poverty, due to the impossibly high water charges, are now facing eviction. There was also the struggle in Bolivia, where the IMF forced privatisation. Thankfully, that was defeated after a long campaign. In Dublin, bin charges were sold off against the will of the people and we now witness the mess as companies ensure their bottom line, with no concern for affordability. Waivers were promised and delivered, then were weakened and removed. The most vulnerable and worse-off were left to the whim of private companies for an essential service.

I and Fine Gael have believed in this over the last number of years and even before that it was part of our manifesto in 2011. Some people have stated that we did not get a mandate for Irish Water, but I believe we did in 2011. A single integrated public utility is the most effective and efficient model to meet the country's water and wastewater infrastructure requirements. It is the correct way forward. The decades of under-investment require a large scale intervention. Irish Water, which is publicly owned, is already achieving savings and efficiencies. There has been investment in every part of the country, including in Galway where a host of problems and challenges are only being addressed now. In the past we had the experience with cryptosporidium. With regard to our beaches and coastal waters, Clifden has thankfully achieved an improvement in water quality in its bathing waters. That was highlighted constantly in the news media for many years, which impacted on tourism. Thankfully, that has been resolved due to investment in Irish Water. What will happen to the investment programmes that every Member of the Dáil warmly welcomes? It is amazing that the people against Irish Water always seem to be able to welcome the investment by Irish Water in their local communities. A failing of our society is the lack of any debate or focus on how we raise revenue. This is why the broadening of the tax base, which included the property tax and charging for water whereby everyone in society pays something for the services they receive, was a correct and proper principle. Were there to be an abolition of water charges we must look at fairness for those individuals on group water schemes, those with private wells who provide for necessary upgrades and maintenance from their own pockets and those who have responsibly paid their bills. I have strongly stated to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that if there is to be any row-back on charges there also needs to be increased funding for group water schemes and private wells. Fine Gael and I certainly do not believe there should be a row back on water charges. Others have commented on a deal which, if it is reached, will be announced in due course. The principle of paying for the services used is correct and proper. As others have pointed out, there are issues with ability to pay. This has been a failing of the system and I accept this. There needs to be closer scrutiny and analysis of those who cannot pay and measures provided to help them. If we constantly attack the sources of revenue it puts us on a dangerous avenue. There has been little debate on how we properly fund our water and wastewater services. They will not magically appear and they must be funded. The provision of clean safe water has been one of the most important innovations of modern society because in the past many people died from unsafe water. People died from treatable illnesses in Ireland because of unsafe water. World Health Organization research states at least 10% of the world's population is thought to consume food irrigated by wastewater. Globally, at least 1.8 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. A total of 842,000 people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hand hygiene. We cannot underestimate the importance of a safe water supply, which requires investment. When I was first elected to Galway County Council - Deputy Canney was there at the time - we received a water and wastewater investment programme from the Department with responsibility for the environment which stated every town and village in County Galway would be funded over the following years, and the following year we received the same list with a year added on to the completion dates. I will not say there was no investment, but there was little investment in valuable water and wastewater services. Fine Gael is often accused of not being on the side of workers. There has been very little thought, although the Minister mentioned them, about the workers of Irish Water. Politicians always get blamed, and that is fine because it is part and parcel and people attack us verbally, but Irish Water staff have listened to insults being fired at the company for which they work. It has been called a calamity, a fiasco and a failed entity. This contributes to the dislike of the company and makes it difficult for them to go about doing the job they do. We can criticise the CEO and people who are on big money, but many Irish Water staff are on ordinary wages, the same as many other people. They are on the same payscale as those who work for Gas Networks Ireland. They been subjected to a sustained attack for going about their business, and this must be acknowledged. The unions in Irish Water request that there be no diminution in the terms and conditions of Irish Water and Ervia employees. The group of unions will not accept any redundancies which might result from any proposed reconfiguration of Irish Water. They also believe a constitutional referendum to ensure enduring public ownership of water services and infrastructure in the State should take place. I agree with this and I regret it has not been done heretofore. It is something that should be considered. Although the outgoing Government had no intention of promoting a privatisation model, as other people have suggested, it would somewhat relieve and allay the fears people have about water. I cannot understand why people have an issue with water metering. People believe if one has a water meter one will pay for it, but water meters save money. They identify leaks. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, spoke about this earlier. The installation of water meters provided jobs at a time of poor prospects for many people in the construction sector. It has allowed an increase in the balance between usage and supply in Dublin, where we have seen major instances in the not too distant past when there was a threat that the water supply of Dublin, our capital, would run out. It would not be good for companies thinking of investing anywhere in the country to see a headline that our capital city did not have a proper water supply. The installation of water meters has helped this because it has identified leaks, which is important. Consumer metering is extremely important and we have seen this in group water schemes over the past 20 years. When I was first elected to Galway County Council, there were problems with an inadequate water supply on the outskirts of Galway city and a district metering scheme was introduced to identify major leaks in the system. This helped, and it also helps in individual water situations. This is important. I am 40 years of age and I remember going to the house of my neighbour, Mrs. Hand, Lord have mercy on her, with a bucket to get water from her well. I remember back in the 1980s turning on a switch for the pump to try to get water from the river, if it worked. This was seven miles from Galway city. Many people in rural Ireland had to establish committees, group water schemes, hold meetings, collect subscriptions and lobby politicians to get water schemes in place. There are still parts of County Galway, such as Kilreekil which will be familiar to people who travel on the road from Galway to Dublin, which has no public water supply scheme. No investment was made. Other areas in Connemara and many parts of rural Ireland are too far to bring public water supply schemes and they fend for themselves as best they can. If one buys a house in an urban area it is connected to a public supply scheme; when one turns on the tap water comes out, and when one flushes the toilet one does so without worrying about where sewage goes to because it is on a mains system. In the country people have septic tanks. If people understood the fight many people in rural areas had they might have a different view of the value of water and believe it should be paid for. I draw a distinction between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay, and the outgoing Government should have done more for those who genuinely could not pay and struggled to pay. With regard to the Costello regional water supply scheme, I have been fighting with Irish Water to ensure we get an adequate supply from Galway city so this very important area has adequate clean water. Previous plans ran into problems with An Bord Pleanála with regard to capacity in Glenicmurrin Lough, but I have been fighting with Irish Water and I hope that over the coming period of time we will hear something about this very important scheme for the south Connemara area.

There has been a huge discussion about how Irish Water works, how it was established and the waste of money involved in setting it up and we have all heard about this. It has been very well voiced in the public domain in recent years. We must be very careful because there are particular aspects to water which we do not discuss, about which I have found very little discussion. Where I live in Galway East there is a huge number of group water schemes. I heard previous speakers talk about people coming together in communities to resist meters, but in east Galway people rose up together to create momentum to bring water to houses.I have first-hand experience of having to draw water from the River Clare to our cattle for the summer, when we might have a drought. We had to do it at our own cost. Eventually people got together into groups and created the network to provide a water supply. They did so with the help of public money, but also with a huge amount of voluntary effort. Some of these group water schemes around the country are a model for the way water should be managed by any utility company, but they have been ignored and pushed aside in the whole debate. One concern I have about water charges and the fact that they may be postponed or whatever is that the people who have been paying for water for the last 40 years are not even being discussed. The whole argument is all about paying for water or not paying for water. Nobody has said to me how these people will be dealt with. Will they get a free allowance or a restoration of their subvention for the group water schemes, which has been reduced? We must consider this matter and have parity in our dealings with people who are getting water in this way. The second concern that I have in my constituency of Galway East is the issue of waste water treatment plants. We have a plethora of private waste water treatment plants attached to a huge amount of housing schemes in our county. They are managed by the residents and the management companies in these estates. They are paying for the supply and maintenance and must pay for any capital cost to keep them up to standard. This is a huge issue. What will happen in the towns around our county if we do not have some sort of structure? One example I have come across in north Galway, in our village of Milltown, is a scheme designed in the 1970s to put in a waste water treatment plant. That is a good while ago. I was in school at the time. That scheme is only now coming to fruition. The plant will be turned on this month, and for the first time we will have a public waste water treatment plant in Milltown. That has taken over 40 years to bring to fruition. It has been designed, undergone preliminary reports, costed, etc. If that is the kind of delivery we had in the past, I dread the possibility that we might be going back there again.

They need them for a number of reasons. In east Galway, where we have tourism, we need to make sure that our waterways and fishing ways are unpolluted. There is only one way we will do that, and that is by making sure that we have proper public waste water treatment plants in place and that they are managed properly over time. I am hugely fearful for all of these private waste water treatment plants. While some of them are being managed now - some are not - in ten to 15 years' time, when the plants begin to break down, who will be there to pick up the tab and pay for them? When we talk about this, we need to do so in a holistic way. We need to be truthful with everybody in this country about what we are doing here. Nothing we will do will be done for nothing. There has to be investment, and the investment has to be made in a way that is fair and delivers both water and waste water treatment plants around our country. If we continue on the path we have taken, we will have nothing but trouble in our country. We need a properly funded framework to deliver water and waste water. We also need to make sure that we have a proper network of metering in our country because anyone who was ever involved in the delivery of water in any group water scheme in this country knows that if you do not have a meter, you do not know where your water is going and therefore cannot conserve your water. We have to look at this in a reasonable way. Delivering water to houses costs money. It is a scarce and expensive commodity, so we need to make sure we conserve it as best we can. Deputy Kyne mentioned Dublin being without water or at a stage where it would run out of water, and if we allow that to happen in the capital of our country, we are saying very little about our country. We talk about job creation, the tourism element, which can create so many jobs, and the environment, and they are all tied in with having a proper water and waste water supply. If we do not have them, we will fail to deliver the jobs. We talked this morning about the economy: where it is going and its projections for the future. If we do not have the economic drivers in terms of proper waste water and water services, we will not be able to provide the jobs or attract the industry, and we need to do that. We also need to make sure, especially considering tourism, that there is no raw sewerage going into our bays or rivers, and we need to do that in a very managed way over the next ten years. We need the money, we need the will to do it, and I believe that within this Dáil we have the people who can do it. However, we must stop making a political football out of something that should not be a political football. We need to get our heads together to make sure we deliver what is best. When we look back on our time here as public representatives, we should be able to say that we made a good stab at it and worked together to get it in place. I suggest that some people who have exercised their minds about the meters should visit some group water schemes, speak to the people who have run these water schemes and talk to them about what getting water out of a tap is all about.

We have all spoken about Irish Water in the House today and have all highlighted the concerns and issues relating to it. Deputies present are very familiar with my constituency, the Acting Chairman and I represent it. They will also be aware of the same concerns relating to the establishment of Irish Water, the way it was done and whether there was a need for it. Most people accept that it was unnecessary at the time and that local authorities were doing a good job and providing the service. The one resource that they have been missing over the last number of years by successive Governments is, perhaps, funding. There are different reasons for this, be they economic or whatever they were at the time, but local authorities in general, whether water or waste water management, did a good job, delivered the services and improved the infrastructure. As we all know, if there is an issue with a person's water service or waste water service and he or she rings Irish Water, it rings the local authorities. They employ the same staff who were there before Irish Water was set up to go out, assess the problem and contact Irish Water about the issue. Irish Water then issues them a purchase order or order number to go out and carry out the work. This is a completely inefficient way of doing business because another completely unnecessary layer of bureaucracy is being introduced. The local authority staff, who had the local expertise, carried out the work to a high standard and delivered an excellent service all across my constituency and the country generally, are still doing the work, but they are now doing it under a new management regime of Irish Water. Everyone would accept that this is unnecessary, and it is done with an extra capital cost that was not needed previously for the staff. Indeed, we now learn that they are subsidised somewhere in the region of €250,000,000 per annum out of our motor tax money. That money should be going into upgrading the infrastructure that we all need for roads, commuting and opening up other ways for industry around the country, where it would be much better spent rather than spent subsidising an agency that is not required at this time or at any stage. I am not in favour of having water charges currently or at any stage. They need to be suspended. We also need to look at a waiver system, which should have been considered and implemented for those who cannot afford to pay. There are many people, whom we all meet at our clinics every week and whom we have met canvassing, who simply cannot afford to pay.
