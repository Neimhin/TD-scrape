I also ask the Minister to outline her plans to address the long waiting times for special educational needs assessment by National Educational Psychological Service psychologists.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I understand the Deputy's question refers to the allocation of resource teachers.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, identified that the current model for allocating resource teachers to schools is potentially inequitable because access to professional assessments is not always readily available to those who cannot afford to access them privately. The proposed new model currently being piloted will remove the formal requirement for such assessments.  In September, my officials had a very positive meeting with the participating schools and through ongoing engagements I expect the pilot to be successfully concluded. The pilot will test the new model and will allow for any concerns to be fully addressed prior to implementation of the new model. The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, does not maintain waiting lists for assessment but, in consultation with schools, prioritises children who have failed to make adequate progress despite an appropriate continuum of support being delivered for those children.

There is no doubt that there are serious problems with the provision of learning support and resource hours, in particular with the distribution of the latter which are based on assessments carried by a NEPS psychologists or on private psychological assessments which parents have arranged for their children because they have grown tired and are unwilling to wait any longer for an assessment by NEPS. I note that the Minister expects the pilot to be successful. I ask her to elaborate on the pilot project and outline how many schools are involved. I note that in recent media reports the Minister has made it clear that there will be no reduction in the number of resource teachers available to any of the schools participating in the pilot. The concern surrounding the new model is that teachers will be taken from some schools and reassigned to others and in effect, the Minister will be robbing Peter to pay Paul because there is no plan to increase the overall number of resource teachers. I cannot get my head around how the Department can run a pilot project while also ensuring that no school sees a reduction in its resources. Ultimately, that goes against what the Minister is seeking to implement.

A total of 28 primary and 19 post-primary schools have agreed to participate in the pilot project. They were initially selected by the Educational Research Centre and efforts were made to include schools of different sizes, different levels of disadvantage and gender differences. One of the commitments given to the schools was that if they participated in the pilot project they would not lose resources during the pilot phase. That was a practical way of ensuring that schools of different types would be willing to participate in the pilot project. We did not want them to lose resources because they were participating in a pilot study from which we wanted to learn. That was why we gave that commitment to them. On the new scheme more generally, it has been identified that the current scheme is inequitable and that we need to move to a new scheme. However, we did not have the information we required on complex needs in order to be able to implement a new scheme fully. That is why we are conducting the pilot and why we want to learn from it.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	The Minister's response shows again that this not a pilot scheme. As she noted, assurances are provided to schools engaging in the scheme that they will not lose any resource teaching hours as a result of their participation. However, the outcome of the change the Minister wishes to implement is that many schools will lose resource teaching hours. How can this be described as a pilot scheme? While the Department may learn something from the scheme, it will be a sham if this approach is not implemented in full, as the Minister plans. The Minister indicated that NEPS does not maintain a list of students who are waiting for a psychological assessment. How appropriate, given that if it were to maintain a waiting list, it would become clear to NEPS that there is no end to the number of students who are unable to obtain the assessment required to provide a clear picture of the supports they need, including the resource hours they need to help them develop. Even if the findings of the new pilot project are implemented, does the Minister not agree that assessments by NEPS psychologists of students who have particular needs will continue to be important in ensuring that schools and parents are made aware of students' needs and that the children in question are provided with adequate supports? The Government must address the shortage of NEPS psychologists and take a realistic and honest approach to this issue. The current approach of introducing a pilot scheme is a sham because it is not a proper pilot scheme.

The increases this year were especially significant, and we also increased the number of NEPS psychologists. This year, for the first time, every school has access to a NEPS psychologist. Every school is allocated a specific number of psychological assessments and some will pay privately to have assessments done, which is where the current inequity arises. Under the new system, we want to ensure that a NEPS assessment will not be necessary for a child to secure the supports he or she needs. It is probably not a good use of resources to have NEPS psychologists carry out assessments solely for the purpose of securing resources for children. Under the new model, I expect they will be freed up to carry out the tasks required to meet the psychological needs of children in schools. It was for this reason that the NCSE concluded that a new model of resource allocation was required.

Therefore, the full-year cost of a five-point reduction would increase the annual primary teacher pay costs by an estimated €90 million per annum. Across the five-year period of reduction, the cumulative increase in pay provision is estimated at €270 million. The precise impact at individual school level is more difficult to predict in terms of capital requirements. A change in the staffing schedule may not always give rise to the appointment of an additional teacher and, therefore, the provision of new classroom. In areas of stable or falling pupil enrolment numbers, schools may already have a spare classroom or be in a position to convert an existing space into a classroom. Where a new classroom build is required the capital cost is almost €135,000 per classroom.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The Minister indicated that the cost of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio by one point would be €18 million for this year. Based on demographic changes, I expect that the cost of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio by one point every year for the next five years will exceed the €90 million estimate provided by the Minister. The rise in student numbers will result in increased class sizes, which means we must take into account an increase in the student population and the additional classrooms and space that will be needed to achieve a five-point reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio over the lifetime of a Government. To obtain the true figure we need information on the cost of new capital and the actual increase in student numbers based on demographic changes. The Minister's €90 million figure is not correct.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	In terms of the capital allocation and based on demographic changes, we expect we will need 19,000 more places in primary schools and 43,000 more places in post-primary schools over the next six years.I acknowledge the Deputy is asking about a five-year period, but we have done the figures for six because that is the length of the capital programme. That is the demographic rise. In terms of the capital costs for classrooms, I have already answered in a way, but it is hard to assess. If schools have spare capacity, one will not need to build more classrooms. One does not need a new classroom unless the class has to divide in two depending on the numbers. It is difficult to give the Deputy an actual figure, but we can probably carry out an assessment to give him as close a figure as we can get. However, as we would need to look at the circumstances of every school in the country in terms of spare provision, we do not have a precise figure on the capital cost.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	That is an exercise we should undertake. All the evidence-based research suggests that smaller class size equates to greater educational output. As a State with one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios in Europe, we must move to a policy of reducing class size. The additional places the Minister refers to over the next six years will only meet the demographic rise. I am trying to show that it is not just about the demographics. While more students are coming on stream who must be catered for with attendant capital costs, the Minister's answer indicates that the Department has no idea of the capital and teacher post allocation costs of implementing the policy to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. Those are the figures we need. How can we strive to have smaller class sizes if we do not have that vital information?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I take the Deputy's point but to give him an example, a school with 178 pupils could be in a position to enrol up to 26 more pupils without triggering an additional teaching post. If the same eight-teacher school had an enrolment of 204 pupils, it would only take one pupil to trigger the appointment of an additional teacher. Whether a school can get a new teacher depends on how close it is to the next point. That changes from year to year in different schools. We could probably get the likely cost for the Deputy for a particular point in time, but that could change depending on population movement. We can probably get him an estimated figure, but it will not be absolutely accurate regarding the point when one would spend the money.

It seems the Department of Education and Skills has not been able to sort out issues relating to the provision of an access road which means children may be bussed out of the area for another year.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	The purpose of the building project in question is to provide a new 1,000-pupil secondary school in Tyrrelstown, which includes an all-weather playing pitch for school and community use. Planning permission has been secured and a tender process to appoint a building contractor is at an advanced stage. As the Deputy said, the project requires the construction of an access road across third party lands to facilitate access to the new school and playing pitch from the existing public road and roundabout. As such, the road is an important part of the project. My Department has been in discussions with the relevant parties regarding the legal agreements required for the construction of this road and it is anticipated that they will be finalised shortly.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	Will the Minister of State clarify what he means by "shortly"? This is a burning issue for many parents and families in Tyrrelstown. The area has been badly served by poor and corrupt planning. A decision was made to allow the developer to pay money in lieu of open space and the people of the area have been starved of pitches and community facilities for years. The delay in the school project is not only preventing the school from opening, which is dreadful, but also preventing the local authority from developing pitches. That is because the local authority has a deal with the Department to reuse the topsoil from the school site for the pitches.Four GAA pitches, two soccer pitches and a cricket pitch are waiting, as is a park that has been promised to residents for many years. Will the school be ready in September 2016?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I thank the Deputy for raising these issues. I do not know the full history of the application, but the area seems to have been poorly serviced by previous Administrations. The new planning system that has been operating in my Department in recent years is correcting that. The new school will go ahead and the site has been secured. There is a delay with construction of the road, as it lies on third party lands that we do not control. The school is on track to be open for the 2016-17 school year, but we cannot guarantee that until the contractor is on site and work has begun. The school has been designed and tendered for a phased hand-over. The aim is for phase one to be ready for the 2016-17 school year. I hope that we are on track in that regard. The Department is committed to the interim arrangements, including transport to the other site, until phase one is ready for hand-over. It looks like the project is moving along, but the Deputy must accept that the issue with the access road is outside the Department's control because third parties are involved. She is right, in that the area has been identified as a priority. Everything should be on track for next September.

People are waiting to know whether their children will need to be bused out of the area again to a temporary building in Blanchardstown village. The Department has put the project out to tender and the road is delayed due to land ownership issues. Are those with NAMA or the developer, Twinlite? I have submitted this Priority Question on behalf of a large community in west Dublin. The Minister of State hopes that the school will be ready, but he has not given us any indication beyond the project ticking along nicely. Fingal County Council has given all that it can in terms of sorting out the planning permission issues. The Department has not fulfilled its role. Two other primary schools, Tyrrelstown Educate Together and St. Luke's Mulhuddart national school, are impacted. This is a disgraceful and unsafe situation. Those schools must access an inadequate road. Until the Department builds this road, those parents will suffer. Children have already been injured. I have been attempting to sort this issue out for many years. and I ask the Minister of State to please sort out the mess that was made in Tyrrelstown. Its large community needs assistance. Pull out whatever stops are necessary.

We are not in total control of the site for the latter. It looks like that matter will be finalised shortly. I cannot say when, as it is a legal agreement that must be finalised. Waving a magic wand to sort it out overnight is not in our gift. We are doing all that we can. It looks like the school has progressed and is on track to be open for the 2016-17 year. The tenders are signed. The Department has prioritised this project and pushed it as much as it can, but I cannot answer for problems with bad planning that go back years. I was not a councillor in the area. The Department has sorted out a difficulty, leaving the legal agreements to be finalised, but those are not totally in our control. I can say no more. It seems like the project is close to being finalised, after which it can proceed to construction. It has gone through every other phase. Nothing else is holding it back. This is the best that I can give the Deputy. She is not happy with it, but it is the truth. I hope that the project will move quickly, but she knows that, when it comes to legal arrangements, I cannot say whether they will be agreed tomorrow, next week or later.

I am pressing ahead immediately with implementation. I welcome the strong endorsement of Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, members and while I have no intention of revisiting the agreed framework, I will engage with the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, to further clarify any issues. Progressing this must be a priority for all. The Framework for Junior Cycle 2015, which I published in August, sets out the wide-ranging and necessary reforms. Students will have a modernised curriculum, better learning experiences and better outcomes. Classroom-based assessments will take place in March-April or September-October 2016 in line with the framework and improved examinations will support better learning. The junior cycle for teachers, JCT, service is now contacting all schools to arrange the in-service training and a programme of seminars and whole-school continuing professional development, CPD, will commence in early November. The JCT will be pragmatic in phasing the training in order that ASTI teachers are scheduled for CPD later in the programme, thereby providing some time for any clarifications to transact.

Before this Minister's tenure, when the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, was in the Department, there was a report on his table on foot of widespread consultation conducted under the auspices of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment that involved teachers, the Department and various management partners. Essentially, it included everyone with a stake in it and that proposal and report was available as a basis on which to proceed with reform. However, the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, thought he knew better and the Government thought it alone had the wisdom as to how the education system should be reformed. He arrogantly proceeded with a completely different proposal, which did away altogether with the State examination element of the junior certificate and making it a school certificate. Basically, the former Minister gave teachers an option to take it or leave it. Subsequently, when this Minister came to power, she reverted back to the proposals in the initial report that had been on the desk of the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, and, again, she issued an ultimatum to teachers to take it or leave it. As matters stand, with only three or four months left at most in the Government's term, the Minister has been left with it and junior certificate reform at present is in a less healthy position than when the Government came to office four and a half years ago.

I note that fewer than 40% of ASTI members have rejected it, but apart from that, everybody else in the education sector is in support. I am not by any means abandoning reform but as I told the Deputy, the Department is writing to all schools and will begin CPD in the first week in November. It will start with the ETB schools because members of the TUI will come to training and CPD. I am leaving some space in order to be able to give clarification to the ASTI, if it requires it. However, to be clear, the Department is rolling it out and I expect it will go in accordance with the plans that already have been indicated with regard to subjects moving from English onwards. Moreover, it is not true to state that somehow or other, I did not engage with teachers. I had detailed negotiations on which the leadership of the ASTI signed off, after which its members, by a small majority obviously rejected it. However, that will not stop us.

The Government has taken a bullish approach from the outset and drove on regardless of making sure it was done in partnership with those who would implement it. This is why teachers, unfortunately, still do not have faith in what, as the Minister has pointed out, their union leadership negotiated with the Minister. They have lost faith with the Minister, certainly with the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, long before that and in particular, with the Government's commitment and approach to delivering reform overall. I note the Minister's leadership in this regard has not changed. She is still firing on regardless but I implore her to take a conciliatory approach in engaging at all times, to unwind what are the remaining issues, to try in particular to deal with how a major part of the remaining issue is a lack of confidence in the Government and to try to ensure a position is reached in which reform can proceed in a way in which everyone is on board with delivering it.

As Deputy McConalogue knows, this reform has been a long time coming and it is my responsibility as Minister for Education and Skills to respond to all the partners in education who want it, to the TUI whose members have voted for it and to the students of Ireland who are central to all of this, and I intend to move forward, but I will provide clarification to the ASTI if they need it.

As the Minister knows, Ashtown has become a much bigger community now, with many new homes. Does the Minister believe it is appropriate that children will go down two flights of stairs in a gym to attend a school with no natural light, ventilation or play area? It seems the reason for that is that the Department of Education and Skills failed to lodge the planning application and make the necessary protocols for a temporary building. Can the Minister explain that?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	The school referred to by Deputy Coppinger opened in September this year in interim accommodation, which everyone agrees is not satisfactory accommodation; that is why it is interim. Following pre-planning discussions with the relevant planning authority, my Department lodged a planning application in April this year with a view to facilitating the new school coming into operation from this September. However, the planning process was protracted, even after we had pre-planning at an early stage. A request for additional information from the local authority relating to drainage and infrastructural improvements was received, which substantially extended the planning timeframe. As the Deputy will appreciate, the planning process is outside of my Department's control. As I said, we engaged proactively with the pre-planning process at the first opportunity in this planning application. I am pleased to confirm that final grant of planning permission in this case was received on 17 September. A contractor has been appointed and the school will move from its interim accommodation to this new accommodation as soon as the necessary works to make this accommodation suitable for a school have been completed, which looks to be on schedule for mid-November.

The only reason parents gave this a shot was because they felt they had no choice. There were other alternatives including busing children to Blanchardstown or Castleknock, but parents decided to have a little faith and go with this option. They are not waiting to move into a permanent school building; that would take a long time. There is meant to be a temporary school building. Will that be ready? Will they be out of this building in November or is the Minister seriously expecting children to stay in one of these basements of a gym, which had to be subdivided and had to have toilets put in? This problem boils down to misplanning. The Rathborne area was developed over many years; it was planned for years. It was known that people would have children and that those children would need a school, and Ashtown Educate Together was deemed to be necessary by the Department for many years. Can the Minister of State clarify if the parents have to wait for the permanent building he mentioned to be built or will they be moved to a more suitable, appropriate temporary dwelling?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The Deputy knows well that they will not because the contract for the temporary school was signed for three years. She knows that. The site will be ready in mid-November. The contractors have been appointed and they will move from that temporary accommodation, which is not satisfactory, in mid-November as planned and agreed. The Department went to councillors in the area.The area has suffered from bad planning - that much is correct - and has done for many years, mainly under previous Administrations, I am keen to point out yet again. To be clear, Department officials viewed the site for this temporary building for the next three years in February this year. On 24 March, Department officials held a pre-planning meeting with officials in Dublin City Council to discuss the proposed planning application for the conversion of the building to a temporary school that would be satisfactory for the next three years. The Department's consultant architect had further discussions before the planning application with officials in the traffic and drainage section of the local authority in the context of making a planning application. On 7 April, the Department received confirmation from the landlord and secured approval in principal for a three-year lease for a temporary school as well as approval to lodge a planning application. The planning application was lodged less than two weeks later on 24 April. The local authority subsequently returned a request for additional information relating to drainage, provision of footpaths and a pedestrian crossing. This was after we held a pre-planning meeting with the local authority in March. It delayed the application, but planning permission was granted initially on 12 August and fully granted on 17 September. Things are moving now for mid-November and the project is on track.

Every community that I have ever been involved with has had to campaign, lobby, hold public meetings and get petitions to get a school. We need to end this fiasco once and for all. Will the Minister of State commit to amending section 4 of the Planning Act, which does not state that schools are a necessary part of a community? There is no requirement to provide schools when a community is being planned. This has to stop completely. Sites must be identified along with a clear structure for how the schools are to come about. I gather the previous regime involving Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats refused to change the system, but it is up to the Government parties now, especially if they are going to carry on into the next regime. Obviously, they probably will not do so under their current guise. Anyway, will the Minister of State commit to amending the Planning Act in order that people do not have to campaign? This is not rocket science. People move into homes and some years later they will probably have children and need a school.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	Deputy Coppinger will probably never admit it, but this Administration has changed the system. There is a structure in place now. The structure Deputy Coppinger has called for in respect of the provision of sites is already in place at local authority level.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	There is no requirement for school planning.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	That is why, in the past three or four years, we have managed to deal with the majority of demand for primary school places. The situation was at crisis point. Under the last five-year plan, which will finish next year, and new plans to come out in the months ahead, the urgency of providing places in primary education has been more or less matched and dealt with, and rightly so. We are moving on now to ensure we have the same solutions for secondary places. This Administration has dealt with the matter. It has dealt with local authorities and put in place a new structure that should have been in place years ago. I fully agree with Deputy Coppinger on that point. There had been complete and utter failure in county planning. We have corrected that as best we can and as quickly as we can in our short few years in government, and we hope to continue with this reform in our next phase in government. I do not believe everyone shares Deputy Coppinger's view that this Administration will not be back to continue the good work in education.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	Is the Minister aware of the issues relating to access to mainstream education for pupils with autism in Cork city - as opposed to County Cork, as stated in the question?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I thank Deputy O'Brien for his question. The National Council for Special Education, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, is responsible for processing applications from primary and post-primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The NCSE has advised that it is aware of a growing need for post-primary provision for pupils with special educational needs in Cork and is actively liaising with schools in the area. I have been advised that the NCSE has not been informed by the schools in question of all of the issues raised by the Deputy. Clearly, if a school has concerns about the availability of supports for children with autism, the matter should be raised with the NCSE in the first instance. I have asked the NCSE to establish the position on the matter for me and to provide an update for the Deputy accordingly.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I thank the Minister for not naming the school, although I gave her the information - that would be unfair. I have raised the matter because I was talking to the parents of a young child who will go to secondary school next year.The primary school he attends offers excellent services, but the secondary school they hope to enrol him in has, unfortunately, told them that it will not be able to take him, not because it cannot provide the resource hours but because it does not have a base room for children with autism. The school has a great reputation for dealing with children with autism, but because of a lack of resources, a growing population and the demand for places in post-primary mainstream schools for children with special educational needs, particularly autism, the need for base rooms in Cork is growing. If a school does not have room where pupils can have a timeout, it is reluctant to take such students. That is the current situation. Resource hours are not the issue; rather, the lack of rooms is preventing schools from taking the number of students they would like to take.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	It is useful to have that information because I will not name the school. However, the information I have is that the NCSE is not aware of issues relating to the availability of a home room or resource hours in the school. We need to let it know that that appears to be the issue. There are now 625 special classes in mainstream schools nationwide for children with autism, 95 of which are for early intervention, 378 of which are in primary schools and 152 of which are in post-primary schools. There are 14 post-primary classes in Cork city, two of which opened this year. The Deputy has reported difficulties with a particular school. We need to advise the NCSE of the issue and it is to be hoped it can be resolved.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	The information I have concerns schools within the city boundaries. There are only four places available for children with autism. This does not involve the allocation of resource hours, because I recognise that the Department will provide them where they are needed. As the Minister knows, for students with autism, the availability of a timeout, home room or base room - whatever way it is described - can be critical to whether a student can enrol in a school. It is my understanding that only four spaces are available in one school for those students who need them. The other two schools that provide such rooms can no longer enrol students because they have reached their quota and no longer have spaces available. I refer to demographic changes, which were discussed earlier. It is difficult to try to identify the increased need for such rooms because we do not know how many students will have special educational needs in five years' time. Does the capital programme have a separate budget that has identified a need for resource or home rooms in particular schools? Will they be provided or will it be a case of everyone fighting for the same pot?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	My information is that the other two schools that have autism units are full. With regard to the capital programme, as far as I know it does not contain a specific category of expenditure for the rooms to which the Deputy referred. Such rooms would be included in the general allocation. However, the intention is that that should not be an obstacle. Where autism units or special classes attached to schools are required, they should be provided. Generally, the Department actively seeks out schools that will take an autism unit and assist them in whatever way it can. It should not be an obstacle and perhaps we need to clarify that that is the problem in the school to which the Deputy referred.

What is the reason for the delay in securing a site? Will the Minister update us on the progress in this regard?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	As the Deputy is aware, technical inspection of a significant number of potential site options for the school accommodation to which he referred has been conducted by officials from my Department, working with officials from Donegal County Council. My officials are currently considering the findings of the assessment and, with the assistance of the local authority, are clarifying technical issues raised with a view to ensuring that a preferred site option can be advanced as soon as possible.The Deputy will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options in order to ensure the achievement of value for money. The complexity of the issues associated with the development of the site options under consideration, combined with competing demands on the Department's resources has meant that the appraisal has not been finalised. Once all options have been fully appraised, the officials will advance the acquisition of a preferred site for the school accommodation.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	As the Minister of State and the Minister know, the proposed Crana College campus in Buncrana is to facilitate three schools. These include Crana College secondary school, which has more than 500 students and more than 11 prefabs onsite. It is not possible to turn these prefabs into permanent accommodation because the site does not have the capacity for further development. There is also Buncrana Gaelscoil, which was established in 1999 and has gone from strength to strength. At present it is accommodated in Buncrana Youth Club and has more than 180 students. The other school is Coláiste Chineál Eoghain, which is the only second level Gaelscoil in Donegal and which is housed in Tullarvan Mill. Two days from today, it will be exactly a year since I raised this issue on the floor of the Dáil and the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, responded to me. The response I received from her on that day was more positive than what I received today. It is bad enough when a project stands still but it is worse when it seems to go backwards. This time a year ago the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, indicated to me it was her feedback and information that a site had been identified. Today, one year later, we are, according to the Minister of State's response, still assessing numerous sites. We need to progress this quickly. It is unacceptable that it is simply not moving forward. Will the Minister of State update me in his response as to why it has gone no further forward and when we can expect to see a site purchased so we can start to progress the project?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	To be clear, a significant number of potential site options were identified by the local authority. It is the duty of the local authority to provide site options. The Department has investigated all of them as technical assessments were required. Most of the sites involve complex issues. It is often the case that a preferred site is identified but this changes after other options are examined. This is quite likely what has happened here. It is a slow process. I have met some of the parents involved and it is important that we get the right site which will not have planning problems down the line and will not be delayed elsewhere. Funding was not there to build a school in the current five year plan because it was not deemed a priority area given demographic demand. Assessment for the next construction plan is under way and demographics in every area are being examined. The Deputy has said how important it is. The unit in the Department of Education and Skills is examining it and will make recommendations on the key priority areas. Separate and prior to this, work must be done to identify the best site, which takes time. The Deputy asked how long the process will take. As I stated, it is complex and subject to completion of successful negotiation and conveyancing processes. Given the complexities involved it is not possible to give a definite timeframe for the completion of the acquisition. The officials will endeavour to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as possible. Everyone wants to pick a site so planning can continue. There will be no delay after a site is picked. It is important to get it right.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	The process is no more complex than what the Minister of State and the Department are making it. In his response, the Minister of State said it is going slowly but the reason for this is how it has been handled. The Department asked Donegal Education and Training Board, ETB, to identify possible sites and recommend one. When this process concluded, the Department decided to start all over again and asked Donegal County Council to do the job instead. This is the fault of the Minister of State. It is his doing and his lack of organisation which has led to these delays and to it being complex. If the Department, the Minister of State and the Minister had their act together on this then whoever they wanted involved should have been so from the outset, such as Donegal County Council and the education and training board doing parallel assessments. While doing its assessment, Donegal ETB worked very closely with Donegal County Council but the Minister of State went back to the start. It is the Department, the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government who are stalling the project. We need to see it progressed.Unfortunately, time is running out for this Government to demonstrate the required leadership because it only has three or four months left. The staff, students and parents of these three schools are suffering the daily frustration of working on sites that are not purpose-built schools.

We want the Department to purchase such a site in order that the project can progress rather than go backwards, as we have seen, unfortunately, over the past 12 months.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	With regard to the time involved, we have heard other questions about policy, time and planning matters as well. It is important that the right site is picked. Previous Administrations did not do that correctly, so it is right for the county council to be fully involved in picking the site.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	Of course. No site is being picked.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I will not apologise for that. We put that reform in place and that is the way it should always have been. That was not always the case. When the site is picked, it will be the right site. That means it will not get delayed at other stages and we will be able to access the site with the correct infrastructure. It will be the right site for all the stakeholders. I have seen with previous Administrations how sites were picked for the wrong reasons. They were left for ten or 15 years, stuck in planning and so on, and that is not the way to do business. It is right that Donegal County Council has a leading role in picking this site with the Department. The right site will be picked and developed. As I have said, we appraise the demographics of all these areas and prioritise schools according to urgency. That is how we have corrected the approach to urgency in providing spaces for children who want to attend primary school. The mess was left behind by other Administrations but we have corrected it. We now have a proper way of doing the planning element. It might be a little slow in the early stages but we eventually catch up when the right site is picked.

The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour among pupils. They include specific requirements on the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow-up and recording of bullying behaviour. There is no requirement that schools report incidents of bullying behaviour to my Department. However, the procedures for schools include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the board of management and a requirement for the board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents' association and published on the school website.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	Has the Minister had the opportunity to study the result of the reforms introduced and the effect they have had? Would it not be desirable to have schools report to the Department fairly regularly, with particular reference to the incidence of bullying in the respective schools?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	We have been following up on finding out how parents and pupils feel about the anti-bullying procedures in schools. The information tells us there is a high degree of confidence among both parents and children with respect to what schools are doing to have a positive anti-bullying climate and responding where there are incidents of bullying. We monitor it in that way. For example, 98% of parents of primary school children and 93% of parents of post-primary school children are satisfied that their children feel safe in school. The response from students is somewhat similar to those percentages. We are aware there may be a small minority of schools that are still struggling to have good anti-bullying policies and responses. We must watch those, and we can use the school inspectorate and other ways to follow up. Generally speaking, the responsibility in how schools do their business goes through the board of management and principal. We have oversight with general procedures but, as I mentioned, we do not require them to report directly to us.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I thank the Minister. I return to the original theme of that question, namely, whether it might be desirable to have the schools report directly to the Department to ensure a universal application of the rules. Have any comparisons been made between the number of incidents reported in each of the past three or four years with a view to measuring the number of incidents after the new regulations were introduced? How many tragic incidents have occurred in schools which are deemed to have resulted from school bullying? Has a particular strategy been developed to address that issue?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	The inspectorate has an important role here, as it visits schools, and the whole-school evaluation process includes procedures relating to bullying, so we have those measures in place. I do not have specific statistics for what incidents of bullying we would be made aware of. I can come back to the Deputy on that if there are specific figures. It is one of those areas we need to monitor constantly because we have to ensure that what is in place in such areas is effective with regard to new issues like cyberbullying, for example. The information we have is that bullying is bullying, irrespective of the medium, and the same kind of preventative measures and interventions work as much for cyberbullying as for the more traditional forms of bullying of which we would be aware. It is an area we must monitor constantly. I will come back to the Deputy on the specifics of numbers.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I fully endorse what Deputy Durkan has said in respect of mandatory reporting. That is an important element that needs to be implemented in order that we can get a more accurate picture of the types of bullying and the age groups, cohorts and different incidents. When the Minister published the guidelines, one of the recommendations was to review those guidelines after two years to see if there was a need to introduce legislation. Has that review taken place and has the Minister considered making bullying policy a legislative matter?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	Having the questions to parents and pupils is part of assessing the effectiveness of what is in place. I do not think the assessment of the guidelines has been completed, but I can get some timelines on that for the Deputy.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	Since coming into office, I have engaged extensively with all education stakeholders on junior cycle reform, including negotiating with the leadership of the two teacher trade unions. In August, my Department published Framework for Junior Cycle 2015, which sets out the wide-ranging and necessary reforms to the junior cycle. Our purpose is to deliver a modernised curriculum across all subjects and to improve the learner experience significantly through high-quality classroom-based assessment and improved examinations. I am determined to press ahead to ensure our schools properly meet the learning needs of students. I welcome the very clear endorsement of TUI members and I hope the ASTI will advance its process of clarification without delay in order that a resolution on its side can be achieved. In the meantime, we will proceed with implementation of an extensive programme of high-quality continuing professional development to upskill teachers in the new curriculum and assessment arrangements.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	We are going back over a previous question by Deputy McConalogue. The issue, as Deputy McConalogue outlined, was that we got off to a bad start. The way the previous Minister went about trying to railroad junior cycle reform was counter-productive. It got people's backs up and there was a loss of trust with the Department. That was unfortunate because nearly all political parties in this Chamber support the concept of junior cycle reform. When the Minister came to office, she tried to rectify some of that and she has done that to a certain degree.The fact that the TUI is now supportive of it is a recognition of the steps that have been taken by the Department but we still have a situation where one of the main stakeholders is opposed to what is being implemented by the Department. The Minister says she is determined to carry on with the implementation, but how realistic is it to carry on with that if she does not have the co-operation of one of the main stakeholders?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	First, the response of the ASTI, despite the fact that there was a rejection by the majority of its members who voted, has been measured in so far as it has indicated that it may be clarification that is required. There may be issues on which its members need more information and I would prefer to give it the space to give them that clarification. Having said that, it would be unfair on everybody else who is supportive of moving forward if we were to stall the process, and we have already commenced the process for students of English. My response is the correct one in the circumstances, that we will move forward. We will provide the continuing professional development, CPD, for those who are willing to come and have it, and it will be by way of whole school, subject specific seminars, seminars for school leaders, teacher-led CPD, school visits and online resources. There is a variety of ways in which teachers can access that CPD. I hope the ASTI will find that the clarification we are able to give will assist it in terms of dealing with the issue.

There is a time issue here because we are coming to the end of this Government's term. Whether it is next month or in April, we have a finite amount of time to resolve this. We need to resolve it before we head into a general election because so much work has been put into it that we need to try and address it. We are already rolling out the English syllabus - my daughter is one of those students in first year who will be the first cohort of students to undertake the new junior cycle reform. I would be cautious in saying that we can go ahead with the CPD for those who were in favour of it and that will buy us time, but it will only buy us a certain amount of time. Eventually, we will have to come to a position where either everyone will be on board or I do not know how feasible it will be for us to carry on with the implementation of it.

Obviously, there are the assessments that must take place in 2016 as well and I am conscious of that aspect. I hope that we will be able to clarify the issues within the timeframe to ensure that there is no concern, in particular, on behalf of the students and their parents.

As the Minister will recall, her predecessor, Deputy Quinn, indicated in 2012 that he hoped to see 50% of primary schools change their patronage, starting in that particular year. I am seeking an update in that regard.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	The programme for Government gives a commitment to move towards a more pluralist system of patronage for schools. In this context, a forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector was established to look at how schools could cater for diversity and ensure an inclusive environment for all their pupils. Work is continuing on implementing the action plan arising from this forum, including advancing the patronage divesting process. Under this process, which creates greater choice for parents in areas where there is not a demographic need for new school provision, eight new primary schools have opened and work is continuing to advance choices in the other identified areas. However, more needs to be done. I intend to reinvigorate the process to speed up divestment and to that end I intend to meet the Catholic bishops and the other patrons in the coming period. In addition to divesting, in those areas where there is a demographic need for new schools, the arrangements introduced in 2011 place a strong emphasis on parental choice. Under this process, 20 new primary schools and 17 new post-primary schools have opened. Some 35 of these 37 schools have a multi-denominational ethos.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	No doubt we need to encourage greater pluralism in patronage within the primary school system.If one were starting today, one would not structure it this way, with 95% of schools under church patronage. In trying to achieve progress, it is important we do it in a way that moves things forward and is constructive. Unfortunately, the Government's approach, particularly that of the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, at the outset had the opposite effect. The former Minister outlined that he wanted 1,500 primary schools to change patronage. How many schools have changed patronage under the Government's oversight and stewardship? The Minister said she planned to meet church leaders over the coming weeks and months to try to progress the project and bring new life to it. How does the Minister see it happening and what needs to happen to achieve it?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	Contrary to an article in The Irish Times today by Fintan O'Toole, which stated only one school had been divested, eight schools have been divested, namely, Tramore Educate Together national school, ETNS, County Waterford, Trim ETNS, County Meath, Malahide-Portmarnock ETNS, Kinsealy, County Dublin, Newtownwhite ETNS, Ballina, County Mayo, Canalway ETNS, Basin Lane, Dublin 8, Tuam ETNS, County Galway, New Ross ETNS, and Gaelscoil na Laochra, Birr, County Offaly. A significant number of the schools come under the new demographics. It is disappointing, and this is why I want to meet the bishops soon and find out whether there is anything we can do to assist the process and to identify the obstacles and difficulties. Much of the delay is probably due to the attachment people have to their local schools, given that it must be done on a voluntary basis. If there is any way we can assist, I would like to speed up the process.

However, it is similar to the Government's approach to junior certificate reform and other key reform measures which the Government wanted to achieve. Unfortunately, the way the Government has gone about its business and tried to achieve reform in the education system has been counter-productive. It has been more about headlines and trying to gain a reputation in the media for being pioneering and reforming than about delivering it on the ground to students. The junior certificate reform failed to meet expectations due to the Government's approach. We must breathe new life into it. It is important that there be more plurality in the ethos of primary schools, and I urge the Minister to take up the baton again, with the church leaders, who have indicated that they are open to it, and move forward in a manner that tries to achieve real progress.

My predecessor, Deputy Quinn, achieved a high level of reform during his time as Minister. He, like me, has been disappointed with the progress in this area. There has been more reform in education during the past four or five years than in the preceding decades. It is difficult to reform a system that has been developed in a certain way, and even the Deputy acknowledged that we would not start from here. It would be ideal if we could found the system from the beginning, given that it is so denominationally governed in terms of school patronage and this does not reflect the population as it is now. I want to move on it. It will be productive to meet the bishops in particular and the other patrons, and we will try to get some more energy and speed into the process.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	The patronage divestment programme is important and we must focus on it continually. It is fundamentally wrong that schools that are oversubscribed and that have a particular religious ethos may discriminate against children who do not share the ethos.I have met parents whose children are unable to attend their local schools because they have not been baptised and will not make their communion. They are from a different religious background and they are being forced to travel two hours to a school which is not oversubscribed. This could be easily resolved by amending section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000, which allows schools to discriminate against children who do not have a particular ethos. If we are serious about equality and about education, we should remove all the obstacles that prevent children from attending their local schools.

I do not think there would be time now anyway. It is certainly an issue that will have to be addressed in the future. I hope to have the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 on the floor of the House, but as the Deputy has rightly said it is the equality legislation rather than the educational legislation that is the current constraint.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	I would like to raise an issue relating to a boys national school, Scoil Mhuire Lourdes, in Carrigaline. I acknowledge that there has been and is going to be a great deal of further investment in the education network in Carrigaline. Scoil Mhuire Lourdes, which is one of the oldest schools in Carrigaline, is split across two campuses. The junior and senior infant classes are on one site in Carrigaline and the rest of the school is on a different site at Ballea Road in the town. The main issue is that the quality of the accommodation is now seriously substandard. A great deal of patch work has been done in recent years. Money has been invested in that work. The school authorities want the school to be consolidated on a single site. I ask the Government to prioritise this project. I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	The school referred to by the Deputy is situated on a split campus, with the senior school sharing a campus with another primary school. The school was approved funding under the prefab replacement scheme in 2012, but this funding has not been drawn down. The school authorities submitted an alternative proposal that involved the provision of all the proposed replacement accommodation on the senior school site, thereby rationalising provision from three sites to one. The Department advised the school authorities that it had no objection to their proposal and indicated that it was prepared to include a special needs provision to meet needs in the area. I want to make it clear that the school subsequently advised the Department that it was exploring amalgamation possibilities and the possible need for a new school building in that context. I now understand that the amalgamation option is not being proceeded with. The Department is engaging with the patron of both schools - it is the same patron for both schools - regarding how best to meet their long-term accommodation needs. My understanding is there has been a change of mind on the side of the schools and the Department is trying to determine exactly how it can make long-term provision in this case.

As he has said, the amalgamation option is now off the table because there has not been full agreement.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	The situation is unsatisfactory, not least because the school is based across two sites. Approximately 100 children between the ages of four and six are on one site. They cannot avail of many of the facilities on the second site because they cannot safely walk to that site. The school has opened a new ASD unit, which is on the site with the junior and senior infants. It is not ideal from the point of view of integrating those children into mainstream education. The most urgent aspect of this matter is the report the school has submitted to the Department raising serious health and safety concerns. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of euro have been spent doing patch work. The school has not drawn down the additional money for replacing prefabs because that is not a proper solution. The amalgamation is now off the table. The school authorities want the school to be on a single site. That should be the desired outcome from the Department's point of view. The Government is spending a great deal of money on a major education campus in Carrigaline involving a new Educate Together school and so forth. That is to be welcomed, but this school needs attention because the current situation is dangerous and is not the optimum situation for parents, staff and pupils.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	The Deputy will appreciate that the Department has been very willing to work with what the schools wanted. Intentions have changed on a couple of occasions, which is grand and okay. The Department have been willing to facilitate that at all times. It stood back to allow time for the amalgamation to be developed, but that is not happening now. The facts have changed. I am glad the report is back in. The Department is now working on that basis and is happy to do so. It has tried at all times to cater for this. Money was provided for some solutions in 2012, but there was a change of mind. The Department is ready to work with a solution. I think everyone agrees that a single site would be ideal. The Department would agree with that as well. It is now a question of making it happen. That willingness exists on the Department's side. The matter now seems to be progressing from the school's side as well, which is helpful.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	Can this project be considered as part of the forthcoming capital programme, which is due to be announced? The school authorities, board of management, parents and staff all want the school to be consolidated on a single site. The main site on the Ballea Road has the capacity to accommodate that. That is what those involved with the school want. That would include the new ASD classrooms that have been provided. There is great demand for those classrooms, which were badly needed. I know an announcement is due. I ask the Minister of State to examine urgently the case of Scoil Mhuire Lourdes in Carrigaline. I ask him to take a personal interest in the health and safety report that has been submitted, which includes photographs from a professional consultancy firm. It does not make for pretty reading.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	Work is ongoing on the new construction plan. I wish I knew what is in it, but I do not. It would be useful for me to know. Every school is being looked at. The demographics are naturally most important when decisions are being made on ensuring accommodation is provided for those who need it. It is a question of meeting extra demand. The last five-year plan did quite well in matching supply to need. I think that has happened. The same logic will be applied to the next plan that will be announced. We hope that will happen in the coming months. The Minister has said that publicly and on the record. All schools, including the school highlighted by Deputy McGrath, are being looked at in that context. They will be prioritised appropriately to ensure the right decisions are made.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	As the Taoiseach knows, since last July we have been raising serious concerns about the Project Eagle deal, which involved the sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio by NAMA. Deputy Wallace has been very persistent in asking these questions as well. I put it to the Taoiseach in July that there is an ethical consideration here because it is not good enough for NAMA to say that everything is okay on its side, but there may have been issues on the side of the purchasers. The fundamental point for the Government and NAMA to consider is that the entirety of the deal must pass a basic ethics test. That there is £7.5 million lying in an offshore account makes me seriously concerned about whether this deal passes that ethics test. Given that this involves the sale of an asset belonging to the Irish taxpayer, the Government in this jurisdiction should be extremely concerned about what happened in the entirety of the deal. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said on the record that he wanted to accelerate the sale of the NAMA loan book generally. We suspected at the time that for political reasons he wanted to close it down in order that he could declare before the general election that NAMA was gone or whatever. There is no doubt there has been an acceleration of many of the loans on NAMA's book. There was a further twist in the tale in the Irish News yesterday.A letter written by Mr. David Watters, an accountant, to the managing director of Tughans solicitors, the firm involved in Northern Ireland on Project Eagle, was published in the Irish News. In the first sentence Mr. Watters says that he is writing "to lay claim to the acquisition fee of £7.5m your firm currently holds." He goes on to give the background to this claim, saying that he was responsible for what was originally called Project Amani and then Project Eagle. He says that the fee of £7.5 million was ultimately to be paid to a vehicle specifically formed for the purpose called Cadogan Futures LLP in November 2010. It seems that a group of individuals - shadowy individuals - were meeting behind closed doors-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	Mr. Watters said that "at this point I felt assured that £7.5m would be paid to Cadogan Futures LLP." He talks about a meeting on 4 July 2013 at Tughans. This letter was sent to Mr. Frank Cushnahan with a cover letter. Mr. Cushnahan was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee to NAMA. The more that unravels regarding this deal, the more genuine concern is generated. There are lots of allegations flying wildly about, but we do know some facts. We know that there is £7.5 million lying in an offshore account to be picked up by third parties. We know Pimco originally raised the red flag about this in terms of concerns about fees paid to third parties. We know that. Pimco says it subsequently pulled out voluntarily, but NAMA says it forced Pimco out.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	That is not the view of the Government at all. That is why there are two investigations going on here. This is a very serious matter. There is a political parliamentary commission looking at it and a police commission looking at it. There are also interests from the United States looking at it. NAMA appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week and gave a very detailed account of the procedures. Deputy Martin is right that £7 million has been identified in an account in the Isle of Man. Who was this destined for? Allegations have been made about personnel who were to be the alleged recipients of that money. That is why there are two investigations going on now. From the point of view of the sale, NAMA has been very clear and forthright. It has provided all of the relevant documentation and the Minister for Finance has said that, notwithstanding the fact that the investigations are being conducted in a different jurisdiction, whatever paperwork, assistance or information is required from NAMA is being made available. I hope the investigations on two fronts can lead to the truth behind the £7 million finder's fee, an extraordinary figure, in an account in the Isle of Man and whom it might be destined for.  It is not the case that the Government does not wish to have this matter concluded and dealt with transparently and with full accountability. As far as the Minister for Finance, the Department and NAMA are concerned, co-operation and assistance are absolutely forthcoming. As I have said to Deputy Mick Wallace on a number of occasions, if there is evidence of wrongdoing then the opportunity is there to bring that to the notice of the authorities immediately, and I hope that happens.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	The Taoiseach knows that the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Committee of Public Accounts are not going to get to the bottom of this. The letter I referred to earlier was written by the same gentleman who said, with regard to the Northern Ireland inquiry, that "Unsupported testimony provided yesterday at Stormont claimed I was due to receive a fee from monies paid to an Isle of Man account. That is completely false. I had no role in it, and was in no way party to, the issuance of this fee. Additionally, and for the avoidance of any doubt, I had no direct or indirect involvement in the Project Eagle transaction." That is from the same gentleman whose letter was published yesterday in the Irish News. That committee clearly is not going anywhere. NAMA is under the Government's jurisdiction. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was made aware of the concerns, including those of Pimco, but said he did not press the pause button. He did not tell NAMA to press the pause button either, but he should have, given the ethical issues that were raised and the knowledge that existed about fee payments to third parties-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	-----which were clearly of such concern to all involved that the original successful bidder, Pimco, had to withdraw. NAMA's defence at the Committee of Public Accounts was that people could not expect it, notwithstanding those concerns, to have pulled the deal, which could have undermined the price. In other words, the price justifies whatever happened. NAMA is under the Taoiseach's jurisdiction and he can set up a statutory commission of investigation which has full compellability. In my view, that would be the honourable thing to do right now, but I can see that everyone wants to avoid that. NAMA wants to avoid it, as does the Government, but it is an essential step because NAMA will not go to Northern Ireland, which is appalling. NAMA has said that it will give evidence in private to the Northern Ireland parliamentary committee. Why does it want to give evidence in private? Why can NAMA not just go up North and give an oral public testimony?

He should not give me stuff about it sending documents up. Why will it not go up there?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	Okay, Deputy. We are over time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	That is like the European Central Bank's sort of leithscéal - we are not answerable to the Irish Parliament but to the European Parliament and we will not turn up to the Irish banking inquiry. NAMA borrows from the ECB's book and says it is not liable in Northern Ireland and is not under that jurisdiction. I do not think that is tenable. Does the Taoiseach think it is?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	NAMA is in this jurisdiction, and under the legislation it is responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts in this House, which reports to the Dáil and the Oireachtas. That committee is chaired by an independent member of the Opposition and is not chaired by a member of the Government. Deputy Martin is aware that NAMA appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week and clearly stated that the sales process that was conducted was in line with international best practice. It was conducted independently and overseen by Lazard, a major international bank. NAMA also said that the integrity of the sales process was fully protected and that no external members of the Northern Ireland advisory committee had access to any confidential information in regard to that sale.

NAMA has fully committed, in this jurisdiction, to responding to any questions the Northern Ireland Committee on Finance and Personnel may have regarding the sale which were not covered during NAMA's appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts on 9 July 2015. We are dealing with two different jurisdictions and two different legal systems. I will give Deputy Martin an example, the case of the Kingsmill massacre, in which information that was available on Garda files here had to be physically transmitted to the coroner in Belfast for his examination after the Government here made a decision that whatever information was available in this jurisdiction would be made available to the authorities in Northern Ireland. There was a difficulty in respect of members of An Garda Síochána being in attendance at the coroner's inquest in Belfast, but the relevant information was made available. The same applies in this case.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	The same does not apply.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	Last month the Northern Ireland committee submitted a detailed list of questions to NAMA regarding the sales process and NAMA responded on 4 September in detail to each of those questions. The full responses to those questions run to over 300 pages and are on the NAMA website. They were also provided to the Committee of Public Accounts, to which NAMA is responsible in this jurisdiction. I also understand that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has received a request from the Northern Ireland committee for any documents that are relevant to its investigation, and that the Department of Finance is working on that particular request.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	Last week, I asked the Taoiseach to intervene personally on the issue of fire safety works at Longboat Quay. I asked him to contact directly the developer of the complex, Mr. Bernard McNamara, to ensure that he and those responsible for the lack of adequate fire safety at the apartments footed the bill. The Taoiseach indicated that he needed some time to acquaint himself with the facts of the case. He has now had a week to do so. Since last week, the position of the 900 residents of Longboat Quay has become worse. They now have 25 days to start remediation works or they will be evacuated. They have also been told by Dublin City Council management that the council will not be in a position to house them if they are evacuated. The derisory offer of additional funding from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has been rightly rejected as unacceptable by residents. They have, therefore, 25 days to produce millions of euro. The Taoiseach and I both know that is neither possible nor fair that they do so. Bernard McNamara and the people he employed are responsible for the apartments in Longboat Quay. It is not acceptable that residents spend night after night living in fear of fire or evacuation while Mr. McNamara goes about his business rebuilding his development empire. The solution to the problem at Longboat Quay can only be found if those responsible for the fire safety breaches are brought around the table and told to pay up.  I ask the Taoiseach again if he will pick up the telephone, call Bernard McNamara, demand to know what role he will play in resolving this problem and convene the meeting I described to bring all responsible parties around the table to foot the bill?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	This is another example of the poor standards that existed during the so-called Celtic tiger years for buildings and apartment blocks such as Longboat Quay. Deputy McDonald is aware that the Building Control Act 1990 placed responsibility for compliance with building regulations on the owner of the building concerned, its designer and the builder-developer who carried out the works - in this case, the person named by the Deputy. Enforcement of these regulations and responsibility for their enforcement are matters for local authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Building Control Acts and Fire Safety Act 1981. The Deputy will be aware of the reports of fire certificates being issued and not being acted on in a particular time. The Planning and Development Acts and Housing Acts may also be relevant to fire safety, which has been the cause of the extreme and stressful position in which the residents of Longboat Quay find themselves. Remediation of defects - renovation works to deal with them - is a matter for the parties concerned, namely, the current owners and the builder-developer and his or her agents and insurers. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be found or achieved through dialogue or negotiation, the option of seeking a legal remedy is always available.  The issues that emerged during this debacle are a matter for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the receiver to the developer, the residents of Longboat Quay and their management company and Dublin Fire Brigade to resolve collaboratively. I understand that all these parties are anxious to find a resolution and the management company and others have met the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the past hour or thereabouts to seek a resolution to this matter in order that the residents, who paid good money for their apartments and homes, are not required to live in this very stressful condition where their homes are deemed to be dangerous.  Since Longboat Quay was built, a number of changes have been made to the regulations that apply. Since 1 March 2015, greatly strengthened arrangements have been in place for the control of building activity. These require greater accountability in respect of the conditions that apply and are awarded for planning in the first place. I am not aware of the detail of the outcome of the meeting between the Minister and representatives of the management company in the past hour. Responsibility is vested across a number of interest areas and I hope the matter can be resolved. I am aware of the reduction in the original figure mentioned but that is not satisfactory for the residents of Longboat Quay.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	The Taoiseach very thoroughly washed his hands of this matter or at least attempted to do so. It is of no comfort to residents of Longboat Quay, whom I visited at the weekend, to hear the Taoiseach recount all of the malpractice of the past as that does not solve their problem. The residents find themselves in a position where there are very serious deficiencies in fire safety in the homes in which they live and for which, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, they paid good money. A derisory and unacceptable offer was made to them. The Taoiseach and I know that the residents cannot put their hands on thousands of euro and should not have to do so because the fault does not rest with them.

The Taoiseach should make clear that residents will not be expected to put their hands in their pockets to pay for this work.

That is what he should do. Will he call Mr. McNamara and make plain that the residents will not bear the costs?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	The Deputy must comply with the Chair.

This is a much more complex issue than she portrays. Serious changes have been made to the building regulations since 1 March 2014. I regret to say that it is my belief, as the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government pointed out, that there are other cases in the system that may be more complex than this case. They are certainly out there. That is all a legacy arising from the assumption made by the party opposite that the country's services and future could be run on the takings from the construction sector.

Deputy McDonald is absolving from all responsibility the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the receiver to the developer, Dublin Fire Brigade and the management company. In her view, these parties do not have any responsibility in this matter. As I indicated, the Minister met various people in the past hour. Far from washing our hands of this matter, as Deputy McDonald suggests, the Minister has acted to support the interests of owners and residents of developments about which concerns arise or allegations of non-compliance in respect of fire safety regulations are made.The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has recently announced an independent fire safety expert report to develop a framework for general application where such allegations are made. The review, which will include a case study based on the Millfield Manor estate in Newbridge, County Kildare, and will conclude at an early date - by the end of January 2016 - will ensure appropriate or enhanced fire detection and alarm measures, some of which have been installed at Longboat Quay, ensure that appropriate escape routes from the premises are designed in accordance with current standards, which may not apply at Longboat Quay, and ensure that there are plans for proper evacuation and that such plans are rehearsed, as would normally apply.

There is supposed to be - the Deputy knows a lot about buildings, and she knows this - a series of regular meetings about any construction project that is under way, attended by those involved, whether it be the architect, the clerk of works or the developers and their personnel. Where a job is going wrong, it should be taken down and built to the specifications under the planning permission that was granted in the first instance.

I heard on Euronews last night that at one time there were 4 million farmers in France, but now there are 1 million ranchers. The same appears to be happening in this country. The Government and previous Governments through the years have neglected family farms. Family farms are responsible for holding a great many local communities together in terms of their schools and shops. The Minister has created a bubble in the dairy industry, which is now turning sour. I grant that €13 million has been given to the dairy sector, but a bubble has been created in which 60,000 more calves will turn into cattle and hit the beef sector within the next 12 months. Promises the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the cartels in the factories agreed last January are now being broken and prices are dropping. Those promises are being broken without the Minister doing anything about it. Prices in the sheep sector seem to be falling the whole time. Young farmers trying to get out there, even though some of them went into it before 2008, have been forgotten. CAP funding is not for the family farm, with 80% of it going to the 20% of ranchers around the country. GLAS was put into Pillar 2 for the so-called family farm. In May last year, GLAS came out and 25,000 people went into it. Sadly, while it is a good thing that it is opening again, GLAS has been changed around completely. The family farm is being driven out of it. I was at a meeting the other night about the beef genomics scheme. The statistics tell one that they are relying on 40% accurate information to tell farmers what to do. One cannot run a business on 40% accurate information. We have a Minister who is talking about helping different parts of rural Ireland.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for his questions. He ranged over three different areas: GLAS, the beef genomics scheme and GMOs. He has also raised the issue of the decline in the number of farmers at European level, although he did not define what he considers to be a rancher in Irish terms. He made the point about rural development programmes. The enthusiasm and energy that was evident at the recent National Ploughing Championship from people all over the country, most of whom were small farmers, was self-evident. Every agricultural course in every agricultural college is booked out because young people now see the agri sector as central to their future ambitions and careers. GLAS will see the participation of 50,000 farmers, all of whom are small to medium-size farmers and not ranchers by Irish standards. The Common Agricultural Policy, with the extra €100 million thrown in for the rural development programme, the recent allocation in respect of the programme for the next number of years dealing with CEDRA, and the putting in place of a national strategy to allow communities, including family farms, to draw and avail of assistance are there for all to see. I do not accept the Deputy's assertion at all that the Irish agri sector is in any way in decline. Of course, the lifting of milk quotas is not responsible in itself for the decline in milk prices. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, fought a good battle at European level to get an extra €13 million, which will be distributed based on the recommendations of the dairy forum, an important institution for dairy farmers - who are all, by the way, carbon-footprinted and contributing greatly to the future economic development of the country. Clearly, the beef trade can fluctuate, and factories have always had their influence in terms of setting prices. That is why we have managed to get access to the American market, the Japanese market for specialised cuts and the Chinese market. These are opportunities that must be worked on over the next period. There is no commercial cultivation of GMO crops in Ireland, as the Deputy is aware. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the different agencies continue to discuss and consider the revised legislation on genetically modified cultivation and what, if any, are the practical and legal implications for the future. It is considered that acting to restrict cultivation where no cultivation would occur is unnecessary. Irish GMO policy, including in relation to the opt-out clause, which Ireland supported when first proposed, is continuously kept under review on the basis of experience and the approaches across member states. Ireland can still opt out of GM cultivation beyond the deadline of 3 October. None of the currently authorised GM crops will be cultivated in Ireland. As such, while the Deputy paints a depressing picture of the agri sector, it is fundamentally central to the development of the economy for the next ten, 15 and 20 years.There are challenges in there, but will dealing with this issue in a carefully structured way not lead to the futures and the ambitions and the livelihoods of thousands of family farms in the country?
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	The Taoiseach referred to youngsters attending colleges and things being booked out. That is 6,500 youngsters over the next two to three years. Consider the ages of farmers across the country. This issue must be addressed. I will pin it down to one important scheme for the Taoiseach, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS. For small farmers in Mayo and across the country, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the same terms and conditions will apply in two weeks' time as when GLAS opened to farmers last May or will he introduce separate schemes for two neighbours with the same acreage that will create a difference of €1,500? The hedgerows aspect, which was worth €1,000, will not be allowed. There is also a change in terms of old, rich meadows and pastures. I have pinned this down to one scheme because it gets complicated in the Dáil if one discusses too many. Will the Taoiseach intervene with his Minister as regards GLAS and ensure that those farmers who enter the scheme now will get the same terms, conditions and options as those who entered it last May? Will he give me a straight answer?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive, together. St. Patrick's Day has become a truly global festival, which presents us with an unparalleled opportunity to engage with political decision makers to advance Irish causes and advocate on their behalf and to focus on our number one priority of job creation by promoting Ireland as a preferred partner for trade and investment, as the home of world-leading products, services and companies and as a high-quality destination for tourists and international students. This year, my visit to the United States encompassed Atlanta, Austin and Washington DC, with a programme focused on engagement with political leaders at national, state and city level, trade and investment events and company meetings as well as events for the Irish community and friends of Ireland across the US. My principal focus was to highlight Ireland's economic recovery and to enhance our bilateral trade and investment links in order to boost job creation in Ireland. I also took every opportunity to press publicly and privately the case for immigration reform and to advocate for the undocumented Irish not just in meetings with the Administration and the congressional leadership, but with political figures at all levels throughout my visit. On this occasion, my programme did not permit meetings with the groups which lobby incessantly on behalf of the undocumented, although the Government remains in ongoing close contact with them through our embassy and through our consulates in the US. My programme began in Atlanta, Georgia, where my engagements included a number of business-focused events, including at the Irish chamber of commerce in Atlanta, where I delivered a keynote address on Ireland's economic recovery, and a round-table engagement with IDA Ireland client companies and potential investors from the Atlanta region. I also held meetings with companies, including Coca-Cola, which is a major investor throughout Ireland, and Oldcastle, which is the largest Irish-owned company in the United States. I had a range of engagements with senior political figures, including the Governor of Georgia, Mr. Nathan Deal, and the mayor of Atlanta, Mr. Kasim Reed. I also had the opportunity to engage with both Senators from the state of Georgia, Mr. Johnny Isakson and Mr. David Perdue. Our discussions covered business links between Georgia and Ireland, immigration reform and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP. I might say that the appointment of a consulate there was really worthwhile in the sense of making arrangements for contacts, with political personnel from here meeting business personnel and politicians from that area. I had the opportunity to engage with the wider Irish community as well as a number of influential friends of Ireland at a range of other events. These included the St. Patrick's Day dignitaries breakfast, which took place before the Atlanta parade which I attended as grand marshal, the Irish consul general's St. Patrick's Day reception, a meeting with the Atlanta-based members of the Global Irish Network and a traditional Irish community event at Atlanta City Hall dedicated to Fr. O'Reilly, an Irish priest who was responsible for saving city hall, five churches and 400 homes from being burned down during the American Civil War. I also undertook a number of US and international media engagements, including with CNN International, to highlight the message of Ireland's economic recovery. I travelled from there to Austin, Texas, where my engagements included officially opening the new Ireland House in Austin, which will house our new Consulate General in the city, as well as the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland offices. Ireland is the first European country to open a consulate in the city, which is America's fastest growing city and has become a major technology hub. I participated in a range of events at South by Southwest Interactive, which has become one of the world's largest technology festivals. I visited the Enterprise Ireland stand, where I met with a number of innovative Irish technology companies, and also spoke at an Enterprise Ireland event focused on enhancing links between the Irish startups and venture capital funds. I participated in a keynote public interview focused on Ireland's strengths as a global technology hub. I also addressed an audience of current and potential investors in Ireland at an event organised by IDA Ireland and I met with senior executives of Dell, which is based in Texas. At political level, I met with the Governor of Texas, Mr. Greg Abbott, where our discussions focused on enhancing the trade and investment relationship between Ireland and Texas as well as immigration reform. My programme in Washington was primarily focused on high level political engagement and business promotion. My bilateral meeting with President Obama at the White House was positive and wide ranging.We discussed Ireland's economic recovery and developments within the European Union and the eurozone. We had a useful exchange on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and agreed on the benefits of concluding an ambitious agreement as soon as possible. While we did not discuss any specific cases, we did discuss the situation in Northern Ireland at that time and the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. The US Administration continues to be a crucial partner in the peace process and is fully familiar with the key issues. I thanked President Obama and Vice President Biden for their personal engagement and for the work of Senator Gary Hart in Northern Ireland. I thanked the President for his efforts on immigration reform and stressed our continued determination to make progress on behalf of the undocumented Irish. We discussed a range of international issues including the Ukraine crisis, the Ebola outbreak, the threat posed by ISIS and the prospects for both the Middle East peace process and the non-proliferation treaty. On this occasion, we did not specifically discuss the issue of refugees displaced by conflicts in the Middle East. I attended the traditional breakfast hosted by the Vice President, Joe Biden, and the lunch hosted by the Speaker, Mr. John Boehner. I also held meetings with a number of other congressional leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Pat Leahy and a number of other senior figures including the Congressional Friends of Ireland group. In each of these engagements I emphasised the importance we attach to addressing the plight of the undocumented Irish and I urged all sides to work towards achieving immigration reform. I also raised this issue with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, during his visit to Ireland on 2 July. As recently as last week, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, engaged with congressional contacts on these issues during his visit to Washington DC. I had a number of business-focused engagements, including a high level roundtable organised by the US Chamber of Commerce and a business leaders lunch organised by our enterprise promotion agencies. I addressed a Science Foundation Ireland event to announce new industry-academic partnerships and to honour prominent Irish and Irish-American scientists. I addressed the American Ireland Fund gala dinner, which gathered contributors to the fund and key members of the Irish-American community. In addition to talking about Ireland's economic recovery, I paid tribute to the important work of the fund in contributing to peace and reconciliation on this island. I was pleased to have the opportunity to launch the Celebrating a Century of Irish Arts and Culture event, which will take place next year at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, and will form a centrepiece of our global commemorations of the 1916 Rising. Overall, my visit to the United States in March was extremely positive. There was an extraordinary level of interest in Ireland's improving economic recovery, as well as tremendous confidence and optimism about the potential for further job creation and for further trade, investment and tourism.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	239	While I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, before proceeding any further Members should note some of these questions have been awaiting a reply for at least six months. There have been ongoing cancellations for various reasons of the weekly Taoiseach's questions and they never have been rescheduled. It is a demonstration of the Government's ongoing disdain for this House and for accountability to the House. All Members welcome the recent executive action by President Obama regarding the undocumented and migration in general. It has removed some of the most immediate pressure from undocumented people in the United States but as Members are aware, it only goes as far as presidential control of the Executive branch extends and the substantive issue of providing long-term security to the undocumented has not been addressed. In his reply, the Taoiseach mentioned meeting various members of Congress and I am worried by what appears to be an increasing trend. Certainly, the current anti-immigrant tone of some of the statements made by presidential candidates, for example, is not something that would give one hope that the Republican Party will end its blocking of comprehensive immigration reform any time soon and that has been one of the major blockages to immigration reform. We should join in the condemnation of statements that demonise and vilify economic migrants, from wherever they are, and I ask the Taoiseach to agree to this request. Some highly inflammatory comments have been made in the context of the presidential election in the United States by certain candidates regarding economic migrants, which is unacceptable and we should be forthright in our views in this regard. The plight of the undocumented is a matter on which work should continue. The Taoiseach has had a series of meetings but stated he did not meet the lobby groups on that occasion. I am not sure whether the ebb and flow of elections will make a deal possible but lobbying does matter. What has been prepared in respect of lobbying the new leadership of the House of Representatives? As the Taoiseach is aware, there has been a change recently and he might indicate to Members whether the Government has fresh plans to lobby on behalf of the undocumented. In his reply, the Taoiseach also mentioned a meeting that involved a number of key scientists and this is a good opportunity to comment on the awarding of the Nobel Prize for medicine to County Donegal native, Professor Bill Campbell, who is one of a significant number of Irish research scientists working in American universities and research facilities. Professor Campbell's work is benefiting millions and the warm congratulations of the House are due to him. The Taoiseach may be unaware he did not receive acknowledgement in the Government's St. Patrick's Day science event and perhaps this will be remedied or addressed next year. He deserves some acknowledgement by the State for his achievements, at least an acknowledgement on St. Patrick's Day, which he did not receive this year. From 1997 onwards, a major policy shift was made in attracting home Irish researchers but this has gone directly into reverse over the past three years. There has been a significant change in science and research policy in Ireland by the Government. As a petition signed by more than 800 internationally recognised competitive and leading researchers in Irish universities stated earlier this year, Government policy is pushing them directly out of the country. I reiterate that 800 people signed that petition. The problem is that basic research, exactly the kind of research undertaken by Professor Campbell, has been downgraded for funding and the area of non-commercially linked basic research in medicine has been removed from funding schemes. Ireland's most internationally successful research group, the immunology research centre in Trinity College, was unable to secure funding from the main Science Foundation Ireland scheme despite being the facility ranked number one in the world. It has had that leading position because of its publications and so on for quite some time now. Consequently, I put it to the Taoiseach that when he meets American leaders and when he travels to the United States, it is time to stop the speeches and telling people about our commitment to basic research and pure science but he should do something to keep research scientists in Ireland. This is a significant issue for the future of the country and is one on which the Taoiseach has fallen down.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	I thank Deputy Martin. I realise these questions are relevant to a period from quite a number of months ago but I believe the offer always was there to have a written reply granted immediately. While that was not requested, it applies in all cases. As I stated, I congratulated the President on his executive action on immigration and met Senators Reid, McConnell and Leahy, as well as the Friends of Ireland. I do not think much will happen now in respect of long-term immigration reform in the United States, given the run-in to the difficulties the parties are having and the preparations for the beginning of primaries and so on for the presidential election later next year. I hope that would not be right and in speaking to the ambassador to the United States in New York at the United Nations last week, she made the point that she continues to work diligently with the Representatives on the Hill about this matter and a number of other opportunities that may arise in respect of surplus quotas granted to other nations which may be considered important, as well as to speak to Speaker Boehner before he retires officially from the role of Speaker as to requests he may wish to make in that regard. I agree with the Deputy; inflammatory comments by candidates are not warranted, particularly with regard to immigrant people. Do we ourselves not know about that more than anybody?I happened to be in Strokestown Park House in Roscommon yesterday. More than 3,000 people were evicted from that estate and 1,400 had to walk to Dublin, take the boat to Liverpool and take their chances on coffin ships to Canada and the United States. If the Deputy has the chance some time, he should visit the museum there and see the pictures from Eritrea and the pictures from Ireland of 1843 and 1845. There is very little difference between them. The comments being made by some candidates in respect of immigrant people are to be condemned. I opened a facility here in Dublin recently, the chief financial executive of which is an immigrant person who came here with parents who acquired refugee status. That contributes greatly to the running of our economy, and we should be very proud of that mix. I agree with the Deputy that comments being made by candidates in these elections are not warranted and should be condemned. I agree with Deputy Martin on the question of the Nobel prize in terms of complimenting Professor Campbell for his works. Speaking to Science Foundation Ireland and the Institute for Research and Innovation, I am aware this is an area that is increasing in importance. Given the limited financial resources available over recent years, perhaps the focus was not as strong as it should have been, but it has been stronger than it was and I would like to see that continue. When Prime Minister Modi was here in the past fortnight, we spoke about this, and the research going on in Ireland in terms of polluted water and all the advantages Ireland is showing in that kind of research and development is of interest to a country the scale of India with its huge numbers. In terms of the United States, we do not have the same bursary facilities that apply in universities there. Clearly, it is an advantage for major universities in the US to be able to offer serious endowments and financial inducements to international people of that calibre to work in their institutions. The Health Research Board funds a good deal of research. The demonstration hub it set up in Cork, in Deputy Martin's own place, for research and innovation specialises in having IT scientists and specialists in that area. If we are heading towards serious changes in the frontiers ahead, science, research and innovation will be of more importance. The science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects in their own way are attracting more young people to do mathematics, physics, technology and science. We hope that continues and whatever encouragement has to be given will be given. I take the Deputy's point about keeping qualified scientific people in this country. We have many of them but maybe it is not all that it should be in terms of what the State offers. We will try to begin addressing that in Tuesday's budget by again reducing the overall level of taxation that applies here because that has become an issue for people who want to work in a country like Ireland where the top rate of tax is seen as too heavy. Government will make a decision on that next week. I thank the Deputy for those comments.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	Can I pick up on the Taoiseach's comment that there is unlikely to be progress on comprehensive immigration reform this side of the US presidential election, particularly with regard to some of the commentary we have seen from candidates? We all want to acknowledge the executive action that has been taken by President Obama, but is there an opportunity for some form of an immigration Bill to be introduced before John Boehner departs as Speaker of the House in the next month? Has the Taoiseach any indication on that? I know the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Congressman Sensenbrenner and he intends to bring forward legislation on E3 visas which would allow people to emigrate from Ireland to live and work in the United States and access visas, amounting to approximately 10,000 per annum. Can progress be made on that? I ask that question because if we cannot make progress on a comprehensive solution in the United States, can we look at specific solutions, such as the E3 visa, that can address specific problems faced by the Irish? To make it a success, however, we need to be able to ensure young people who are stuck in the United States can come back to Ireland, avail of that E3 visa, and return to the US. Is the Taoiseach aware that the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform is saying that while about one third of people undocumented in the US could avail of existing visas available through the Irish embassy here, because of the three and ten-year bars that are in place for someone resident and undocumented in the United States, they cannot come back to Ireland to avail of that? Mexico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic have been very successful in using that as a mechanism to deal with their undocumented issue. The issue is being raised consistently and I received a leaflet again today to the effect that the Irish Government has not sought that visa from Ambassador O'Malley in the Phoenix Park. While a request has been written by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there has not been a formal request from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the introduction of this executive waiver which would unlock a problem for about one third of the undocumented in the United States. I do not know the ins and outs of this but I would like the Taoiseach to clarify that for me because it is being circulated widely that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are not prepared personally to seek this executive waiver. If they did, it would be made available to undocumented Irish in the United States and could allow a significant number of those to come back to Ireland to avail of a visa to go back into the US. Clarity on that issue is needed. I hope we will see some progress by John Boehner on the issue, even in the current short window, because every opportunity needs to be taken to see if we can push that along.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	Deputy Naughten will be aware from his experience of how this operates in the United States in terms of having two Houses that function, both Senate and Congress. Given what is happening there at the moment, where there is a degree of polarity between the two Houses and the two major parties, I do not see it happening. I might be wrong and I hope I am. President Obama made his executive decision, which is quite limited. It was blocked in the Houses afterwards. I met Speaker Boehner, Representative McConnell, Representative Reid, Representative Leahy, the Friends of Ireland and so on and made this case very strongly. Some of the politicians would say they would see an opportunity to tag one element of a bill onto another, which could go through the House but then they may not have the votes, and it is a question of whether they could get a certain number of Democrats or Republicans. It has not worked with Speaker Boehner in situ and, with respect to them all, I do not see it moving along now. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Representative Jim Sensenbrenner in another attempt to get E3s. I hope that yields some progress. There is the facility that Australia never used up all its visas, and perhaps these might be transferable to another country. That might not be possible. It might be taken as a poor signal from one country that has not used up all the visas allocated to it, but we have personnel who could do that. I will tell Deputy Naughten something else. I am very concerned now at what is purported to be happening in respect of J1 visas. Deputy Naughten will be aware that approximately 7,500 of our young people go to America every year on a J1 visa. This represents an extraordinary opportunity for young people to experience American life, the personality of America, the experience of working in America and to make new contacts. Obviously, this brought its own tragedy in Berkeley earlier this year. Anyway, because of a series of issues that have arisen, the authorities that issue J1 visas seem to be bent on introducing a requirement for pre-employment for young people before they go. I am unaware of the extent of the paperwork and administration that may be involved, but if that were to happen it could lead to two things. First, a serious reduction in the number of J1 visas granted to Ireland; it could perhaps be down by as much as 60% or 80%. Second, people who travel out on holiday visas may then decide to work illegally, which would only cause trouble for themselves and everyone else afterwards. A number of areas require political clarity about what is required. When I met the US Senator, Mr. McCain, about this matter he said that thousands of workers who come from Mexico might be better having a short-term working visa because many go home to their families when the crops are all in and the harvest is gathered, as the song goes. I think it was a Woody Guthrie song - I am showing my age.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	In any event, I believe this is going to be problematic, particularly for a country like Ireland. The nature of our traditional connection 50 or 60 years ago and before was that people left and never came back. This has changed now. I firmly believe that the J1 system has been important in keeping that connection alive in the modern sense with young people in university and throughout the country working in America for the summer and so on. It keeps the connections between our countries very much alive currently and for the future. If that is going to be reduced seriously then it could cause real problems for relationships in the time ahead. I believe everyone in the House has the same view on the matter. We are keen to have a streamlined, effective strategy. However, this requires political will and acceptance. Unfortunately, because of the situation that applies between the US Congress and Senate, these are not in place at the moment. Some members of the US Republican and Democratic parties are willing to work on these things to try to get the numbers and tag the facility on to an existing Bill that will go through towards the end of this session. That is what is needed. When I was out there last year, the idea was being put forward very strongly that the best time to introduce either an Irish immigration element or major immigration reform would be at the start of the approaching session, that is to say, in September or October last year, but that did not happen. Now, things are moving on in the United States and they are campaigning with different party credentials for candidacy and I imagine it will be difficult. Anyway, I will certainly work with all Members and through our ambassador and consulates in constantly contacting the personnel there about E3 visas and an element of immigration reform in the absence of overall immigration reform. Certainly I am not keen on a situation where there would be an abrupt ending to the J1 system as we know it through the dramatic introduction of a requirement for pre-employment. Independent authorities grant these visas. If that is being considered by them, and it is, then there should be a transition period during which young Irish people would be able to go to many different places in the United States and not only be congregated in one or two locations, which has its own implications. This is a serious matter and something I am prepared to talk to the US ambassador about. I have discussed with him previously the three-year bar and ten-year bar and I will follow up on the point Deputy Naughten raised. Through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and everyone else, we should keep in contact with the ambassador, the consulates and American political representatives. Unfortunately, I believe deep down that we are not going to have major immigration reform now. If the Sensenbrenner initiative works or the efforts being made now by our ambassador, H.E. Ms Anderson, come to fruition and give a few extra visas that are in the system but not allocated to Ireland, that may be of interest to us as well.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	No. It was before my time. Obviously, the development the Taoiseach has described around the J1 visas is concerning. Will the Taoiseach set out exactly what he has done about it so far by way of engagement or representation? Although that is concerning, it is secondary to the longer-standing and deeper concern for the undocumented or those who have overstayed various visas in the United States. I know this is a matter on which the House is united in looking for a resolution. However, what I am not clear on, outside of the Taoiseach's visits to the United States, especially on the occasion of St. Patrick's Day, is the rhythm of the Taoiseach's engagement on this issue. How regularly does the Taoiseach, personally, or his Department intervene and interface with members of the US Congress or the US ambassador in Dublin? I am keen to get a sense of how that works. Can the Taoiseach set out the supports afforded by the Taoiseach's Administration to those groups which, as he has said, work incessantly or tirelessly on behalf of the undocumented stateside? I warmly welcome the remarks the Taoiseach has made in respect of the rather vile commentary in respect of immigrants to the United States. It is not only ourselves as an emigrant nation who understand that phenomenon. The United States is built on the immigrant experience, not only from our shores but from further afield. I very much welcome the Taoiseach's comments. When the Taoiseach met President Obama, did he discuss the current refugee crisis, the Syrian crisis? What was the content of that exchange? What discussions has the Taoiseach had in respect of the Stormont House Agreement? As we know, the negotiations are under way. The Taoiseach has acknowledged that the North is a special case in many respects since it is coming out of a period of protracted conflict. All of us support and understand the concept of not only peace but a peace dividend in economic terms. Will the Taoiseach press for the restoration of the block grant budget that has been stripped of £1.5 billion? This looms large in the current negotiations. Has the Taoiseach pressed for a workable budget for the institutions? Will the Taoiseach honour his commitments in respect of the construction of the A5 motorway? Did any of these matters form part of the discussion the Taoiseach had with the President of the United States? Question No. 29 relates to human rights lawyer Pat Finucane. He was shot dead in front of his wife, Geraldine - she was also shot - and their children at their home in north Belfast on 12 February 1989.I think the Taoiseach will agree with me when I say that Pat's family are to be commended on their courage, diligence and stamina in demanding a public inquiry into the killing. The trauma and stress they have experienced has been made all the greater because of the intransigence of the British Government to honour a freely made commitment at Weston Park to hold a public inquiry. In 2001, as the Taoiseach knows, the British Government agreed, along with the Irish Government, to invite Mr. Justice Peter Cory to determine the need for an inquiry. He concluded that there ought to be one, and yet the British Government has refused to implement the Weston Park Agreement.

This is a matter the Taoiseach has raised consistently in the United States of America. Did it form part of his discussions with President Obama on the occasion of his last visit some time ago? What about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP? It is a comprehensive free trade and investment treaty being negotiated between the European Union and the USA. It is a very controversial proposition. Did the Taoiseach discuss this matter with the President? Did he raise with him the real threats it would represent to our democratic institutions, standards, public services, workers and agricultural sector?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	The Deputy has raised quite a number of questions. As I said, I expressed a view that the potential diminution in J1 visas would be a serious blow to connections between Ireland and the United States and to the opportunity for so many young people to work legitimately in the US and avail of a wonderful experience. We have regular reports from the consulates in the US and the ambassador. Ambassador Anderson is a very dedicated official who is in constant contact with different political personnel on Capitol Hill. I meet the US ambassador, Mr. O'Malley, on regular occasions at different events. This has to be done on the far side and requires the politics of the United States to deal with comprehensive immigration reform. There are 15 million people or more in the United State illegally. Some candidates said they will send them all away, but that cannot happen. Those people's lives would be far more beneficial to the US and its economy in the future if they were legitimised, had legal status and were able to contribute to their lives and the business of the United States. In Congress, the current consensus on Capitol Hill appears to be that the next opportunity for a push on comprehensive legislative reform on immigration is not likely to arise until 2017, which is after the presidential election. The use of immigration as a negative and emotive issue in the Republican presidential nominee race only adds to that particular message being reinforced, which I regret. In the interim, the Irish embassy in Washington is pursuing a strategy for E3 visas for Ireland with the intention of taking advantages of any opportunity to move forward on immigration legislation that might present itself. I cannot say that it will. As I said to Deputy Naughten, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, was in Washington last week and met Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. It was announced that a Bill had been tabled by him which could provide for the reallocation of thousands of E3 visas for Irish participants. However, it has to be said that it is only the first step in a long, difficult and complex process which will have to be navigated if the Bill is to become law. I spoke to President Obama about this matter and obviously he has been limited in what he can do and has done what he can do. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Vice President Biden on 30 March at the opening of the Edward Kennedy Institute. He emphasised Ireland's continuing concerns regarding immigration reform and, in particular, the importance of the travel issue for the undocumented Irish. We are all aware that people cannot come back for family events or tragedies, an issue which is of serious concern to us. The Minister also had, as I had, meetings with the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who reiterated on 2 July that this was a matter he had worked on for several years and that while it was difficult to secure progress, he would keep trying. He spoke at the American Chamber of the need to make progress on immigration reform, and I addressed it the following day and spoke on the same issue. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met all the people I mentioned, namely, Paul Ryan, Richard Neal, Jim Sensenbrenner, Joseph Kennedy III and so on. A sizeable number of visas - 15,000 - are allocated to Australia under the E3 system. It is less favourable than a stand-alone provision for Ireland. The issue is being pursued but I am not sure how the connections between Australia and the US would view a situation like that. At his meeting with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, Congressman Sensenbrenner said it would be necessary to have a Bill of that sort passed by the Senate before one could be passed in the House of Representatives. He explained that many Republicans, including Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, would be concerned that such a Bill might be added to in the Senate by those wishing to broaden its focus to more than general immigration reform issues and that it was necessary to deal with those fears first if the Bill was to get anywhere. He indicated, however, that he was ready to table the Bill in the House of Representatives immediately, which he did the following day, while making it clear that action to move it forward would have to wait on progress in the Senate. One can see the complications. Congressman Sensenbrenner is a very experienced operator and is well regarded on the immigration issue in Republican circles. The sponsorship of the Bill is positive and a great deal of work now has to be undertaken. His Bill will remain on the books until the end of the legislative session when, if not acted upon, it will fall, which is a possibility. The E3 visa has been available to Australian citizens since 2005. It allows for 10,500 Australians to travel to and work in the US for a year, up to two years or indefinitely as long as the individuals concerned have met the eligibility criteria and have valid job offers. Spouses and children of visa holders can also travel. On the basis of reciprocity, Australia offers a similar scheme to US citizens. There is the whole question of visa waivers. On 24 February, on instruction from the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, a letter was issued from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the US ambassador, Mr. O'Malley, on the wider issue of US immigration reform as well as on the question of waivers. This letter inquired whether it would be possible to create a predictable and positive pattern for waiver approval within existing US regulations. The Minister subsequently met the ambassador and discussed the issue with him on several occasions. I raised this myself during my visit to Washington on St. Patrick's Day. The US embassy has indicated that the waiver system is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations and is operated uniformly worldwide, including here. An application for a waiver on the grounds of inadmissibility, as it is known, is an application for legal entry to the US made by an individual who is otherwise inadmissible on one or more grounds. Such a waiver can be applied for in the case of a three or ten-year ban having been imposed for overstaying a visa in the US in the first place. The US embassy has underlined that applications are assessed individually case by case, with final decisions on each being a matter for the US authorities in Washington and that, accordingly, an applicant would not be able to predict with any degree of certainty whether he or she would be successful. While this response is very disappointing, ultimately it is a matter for the US Government and embassy to interpret and implement their immigration laws.I mentioned to President Obama the situation that applied in Northern Ireland. I did not actually discuss with him the A5, the Narrow Water bridge, the Ulster Canal or a number of other issues, but I did say to him that obviously we would continue to support, where that is possible, these pieces of infrastructure. We have had money in place for the A5 for quite a number of years, but it has not moved to a point where it has been drawn down because of legal problems and court cases. It is important to determine what is actually required and how much is involved. There has been £50 million available for a couple of years but it has not actually moved. If I recall correctly, we discussed the implications of Stormont. I have always defended the Finucane family, and Geraldine Finucane in particular, in respect of backing a call for a public sworn inquiry in this case. I might just add, for the Deputy's information, that today the Government approved the retrieval of information facility which is part of the Stormont House Agreement. This, in theory at least, would lead to information relevant to an issue, incident or event in Northern Ireland being made available to a person looking for it. It remains to be seen whether it will actually apply in practice. The theory is that irrespective of where the blockage was in the past, an independent person would make the information sought available to the person seeking it, if it directly pertained to the person or his or her family. This will require heads of legislation coming through from Britain and here, and the intention is both Governments will sign this element of the Stormont House Agreement into effect on the same date. It will take some time for the two Parliaments to deal with it and it needs to be compatible, so if there is a request either way it will be made available in respect of Northern Ireland. We did not discuss the question of the extent of migration, except to say the situation in the greater Middle East was extremely fragile and very sensitive. The literal flood of migrants across the Mediterranean and through Eastern European countries was not evident at that stage to the extent it became evident afterwards. The United States has made comments and taken some action on this. Clearly the current situation in so far as Syria is concerned, with Russia and the United States in there, is causing confusion and has led to a tragedy at a Médecins sans Frontières, MSF, hospital, with conflicting reports of how it came about. On the question about block grants, we are precluded under the strands of the agreement from involving ourselves in this. We did go to Stormont prior to Christmas and eventually there was agreement on the agreement, including responsibility being accepted by the politicians in regard to welfare reform and the elements of money involved. Prime Minister Cameron responded to this in his own way. Obviously the situation drifted downwards afterwards and I am glad that at least there is now focus again by the political representatives on moving it forward, and I hope it does. I met former President Clinton in New York when I was there for the United Nations. I had a very good meeting with him. Obviously he is well aware of Senator Hart being appointed as envoy to Northern Ireland. He has a passionate interest in Northern Ireland given his many years experience here. While not wishing to become centrally involved, he has said that in anyway he can assist or offer advice it is available as a general element of the process.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	Earlier the Taoiseach used words such as unhelpful or uncomfortable to describe some of the language used by presidential candidates during the election campaign in terms of immigrants in the United States. Do we need to be a little bit more forthright in roundly condemning the language of one particular candidate, Mr. Donald Trump, who has been condemned by governments, civil rights organisations and human rights organisations for using what can only be described as utterly despicable and racist language? He accused Mexico of exporting its rapists and criminals to the United States. What is very relevant to the undocumented Irish is that he has called for the expulsion of all 11.3 million undocumented workers in the United States. This is the same Donald Trump whom the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, met in Shannon Airport in May 2014 with a red carpet, harps and people in traditional Irish dress in what was frankly even at the time quite a ludicrous show of deference to this multibillionaire. This same person now turns out to be somebody who is literally whipping up an outrageous and dangerous hysteria against the undocumented, who include the Irish undocumented. Do we regret rolling out the red carpet for a man who would say this about immigrants in the United States? Will we condemn what he is saying? He will hear those words given his investment in this country. It will be something he will hear if the Irish Taoiseach and political system condemn him utterly for the words he has used to describe undocumented immigrants in the United States from wherever they may come. I ask the Taoiseach to respond to this and make this forthright condemnation when somebody is being racist, and that is what he is. He is whipping up dangerous hysteria, whereby there are serious reports of immigrants actually suffering heightened levels of violence, threats and racist stereotyping specifically because of the language and rhetoric Donald Trump has used. It is emboldening the worst and most racist elements in the United States to attack, physically in some cases, target, vilify and demonise undocumented immigrants. This is mostly directed at Mexicans, but he has said he wants to expel all undocumented workers from the United States. In the context of the refugee crisis, and particularly the situation in Syria and how it has been one of the major centres from which these refugees are fleeing, did the Taoiseach, as we asked him to on a number of occasions earlier this year, raise criticism, questions and concerns about the role of the United States in creating the conditions for this refugee crisis through its actions in Iraq, support for Saudi Arabia and arming of these regimes which have then gone on in turn to finance, support, give succour and create the conditions for the rise of ISIS? Somebody has to start saying this stuff because the consequences have been so devastating. The Taoiseach mentioned his attendance at the UN meeting in New York. I have heard an unconfirmed report, and I would like a straight and direct answer. Did the Taoiseach meet, or have any engagement with, General al-Sisi, the president and dictator - there is no other word to use for this man - of Egypt?Did the Taoiseach or any of his officials or representatives of the Irish State or political system meet President el-Sisi, the man who is engaging in mass executions and mass trials of his own citizens, as well as Ibrahim Halawa? If they did, was the Halawa case raised? His trial has been deferred yet again, and he has been incarcerated for two years in prison.

Did the Taoiseach meet President el-Sisi in New York or did other officials have any engagement with him? If they did, was the issue of Ibrahim Halawa raised?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	I condemn them unreservedly in the context of immigrant people. We have 70 million people ourselves worldwide who claim Irish ancestry. Many of those were deported or left because of economic circumstances. Many left because of colonisation and the consequences of the Great Hunger. It is something very deep in the Irish. I commend again our naval personnel, who have taken from the waters of the Mediterranean more than 7,000 people, men, women and children. In life and politics, sometimes one must meet people with whom one disagrees. Sometimes we meet people and there may be very wide differences of opinion.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	The matter of Syria has been discussed at some considerable length at European Council meetings, where the bigger countries in Europe have taken action in respect of the opposition in Syria to the Assad regime. We have discussed this before and everybody is of the view that the Assad regime should go. The latest intervention, involving the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and Mr. Lavrov from Russia, on how ISIS is to be dealt with in Syria is an obvious case in point. The hundreds of thousands of people displaced and living in camps in both Jordan and south Lebanon, trekking across into Turkey and from there to Europe, speak for themselves on this absolutely devastating issue. We spoke of the European position and the need for action to be taken to end this war. There is another issue in Libya, which has no government either, and there is open season in terms of people from the Horn of Africa moving through to Europe. I met the Egyptian President for 30 or 40 minutes with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and officials. We spoke to him about Ibrahim Halawa and made very clear, without any equivocation, our desire for this young man to be able to return home to Ireland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has had detailed discussions on this in the past week. I also made it clear, however, that we cannot change the judicial court system in any other country, and I discussed very clearly with the President the question of eligibility, once the system had been gone through, for a presidential pardon for Ibrahim Halawa. I left the President in no doubt of our request that a presidential pardon should be considered and granted so this young man can come home. In speaking to the President, I was not aware at the time that the trial would again be postponed because of the illness of two of the people on trial. I can confirm to the Deputy that I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and officials, met the Egyptian President formally, with minutes taken. We also discussed the quality of the developmental programmes that Ireland operates in sub-Saharan Africa, and he expressed an interest in learning more about those in view of the number of immigrant people and refugees taken into Egypt in the last period.

Does the proposed authorisation by Dáil Éireann for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to instruct legal representatives relate to the legal action being taken by Mr. Denis O'Brien against the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	279	This is a fundamental issue, given that the House and its Members are being challenged with respect to their work, along with the concept of the House being in charge of itself under the Constitution and the separation of powers. The issue is very serious and merits debate and contributions from Members of the House.I say that sincerely. In my lifetime I have not come across such a substantive attempt to change the order. When I say "change the order", I mean in terms of the pre-eminence of Parliament in the conduct of its own affairs. This is fundamental to our Constitution, to freedom of speech and to independent thought in our society, and I have serious concerns about what is transpiring. It seems that at the very least we should facilitate a debate in the House to allow Members to make a contribution to it. The Taoiseach might also clarify why he is not holding a debate on No. 13, regarding the banking inquiry.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	280	In respect of No. 13, it is just that the Chairman and the committee have requested extra time in which to deal with the report, until 28 January. They requested extra time to draft it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	The reason I am asking for a debate on that is that there is a lot of talk. The Taoiseach yesterday refused to confirm whether there will be a general election. I do not see what the issue is. If he wants to name a date, he should do so.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	Given all the speculation and commentary, and the refusal of the Taoiseach to rule out a November election, why would we extend the remit of the banking inquiry unless we are certain the Dáil will be here in January?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	The position is that if the Dáil collapses or fails and there is a general election, that inquiry collapses. It cannot be restarted or reinitiated under a new Dáil. There has been a lot of discussion and commentary about the banking inquiry, as well as a lot of investment and expenditure on it and hype raised about it. It may not be achieving what certain people wanted it to achieve from day one, but the bottom line is that it is reasonable to ask for a debate on that so that we can get clarity as to whether the banking inquiry will fulfil its remit-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	Given that the Dáil has now voted through a resolution at the request of the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis for the inquiry to be extended to and report in January, can we take that as confirmation that there will not be a general election in November or before Christmas?It is important in terms of the working and the order of the House that we get clarity on the issue. It is a very simple matter and I have no difficulty. The question of whether the Dáil will be meeting in January is important, given the amount of work and investment that has gone into the banking inquiry. Given the Taoiseach's lack of comment yesterday, I ask him to tell us. Under the social welfare (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, will the Taoiseach ensure a report commissioned by the Tánaiste on the impact of the cuts to the lone parent allowance will be published as a matter or urgency? The report was done in July by the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the findings about supports for lone parents are stark and shocking. The report is with the Department of Social Protection, but has not been published. Can the Taoiseach explain why and ensure it is published? The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, told the annual conference of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, that we would publish legislation to establish the first hospital trust, the children's hospital trust, on a statutory basis before the end of the year. Does the Taoiseach expect the Minister to honour his promise, or is he setting a new 18-month waiting time target for legislation? The programme for Government is one of the greatest documents that has been written in a long time. There is great stuff in it. In the public service reform section, there is a section called " 'Choice and Voice' for service users". It states: "Rather than giving fixed budgets to traditional public service providers like the HSE, VECs and FÁS, we will put resources into the hands of citizens to acquire services that are tailored to better suit their needs and less expensive for the taxpayer." Could the Taoiseach indicate when we can expect this to happen and when the legislation will be brought forward? The programme for Government also states, "In local services, we will establish a website - www.fixmystreet.ie - to assist residents in reporting problems with street lighting, drainage, graffiti ... with a guarantee that a local official will respond within 2 working days." It is not happening in my area. The programme for Government also states, "We will give schools, hospitals and other public service bodies new freedoms - within strict budgets and new accountability systems - to set their own staffing needs, automate routine processes and adapt work practices to local staff and customer needs." When can we expect legislation to inform this? There is much more. I will keep my questions short. The programme also states, "We will bring to an end the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions." Anybody who has read the Fennelly report will know the Government has not brought an end to what it called "the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions." I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could indicate the processes in his Department to ensure that very significant decisions that have been taken - such as the sending out of a Secretary General to a Garda Commissioner's house close to midnight - are recorded. Can the Taoiseach indicate why no record was kept on that occasion and why the processes the Government committed to in the programme for Government did not click in for the events of that evening, involving the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, three Secretaries General and an Attorney General, of which no record at all was kept and for which there is no documentation?

One family concerned with these issues joins us in the Visitors' Gallery this evening. Ann Doherty, the twin sister of Mary Boyle, a six-year-old girl who disappeared close to her grandparents' home in Donegal in 1977, firmly believes there was both political interference and a Garda cover-up in the case. Would the Taoiseach be willing to meet Ann Doherty to listen to her concerns regarding the Garda handling of the case?

If the Deputy will send me the contact number for Mary Boyle's sister, I will be happy to talk to her.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	354	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity to raise a most important issue that has arisen on foot of the HIQA report into a possible outbreak of legionnaires' disease at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. Legionnaires' disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia which can affect anybody but which principally affects those who are susceptible because of age, illness, immunosuppression or smoking. Legionella bacteria are found in many types of water systems. They multiply in warm and stagnant water such as that found in air conditioning cooling towers and certain plumbing systems, especially showers. Approximately ten cases are reported in Ireland each year on average. This HIQA report is very worrying for the patients and staff at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State a number of questions. How often are the water systems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and other hospitals in the country checked in order that the threat of Legionnaire's disease can be prevented? What immediate action is the Minister taking in relation to the legionnaires' disease outbreak at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital? On a national level, how does this country deal with an outbreak of legionnaires' disease? What are the contingency plans? What are the roles of hospital management and the Department of Health? What are the protocols for dealing with legionnaires' disease? How do we deal with problems facing Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital? Where is the Minister's five-point plan for hospitals generally? I am aware that we have a general election coming up. I do not doubt that promises will be made. I urge the Minister of State to find a workable solution to the problems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. It is basic common sense. The HIQA report states that shower heads were removed from patient bathrooms 18 months ago and not replaced. This is simply not good enough. I concur wholeheartedly with the statement in the HIQA report that it is "essential that management of legionella risk at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda is effectively managed, with a particular focus placed upon protecting patients who may be especially vulnerable to infection". There is a need for further care for the patients of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Just last week, I spoke in the Chamber about the crisis in the hospital's emergency area. This week the issue is different. The hospital seems to be continually in the news for one reason or another. I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that we need an action plan for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. We cannot continue to play politics with people’s lives. The Minister of State is well aware that the total population of the two counties served by this major hospital - my county and his county - is approximately 300,000. In addition, many people from north County Dublin and counties Monaghan and Cavan come to Drogheda in emergency circumstances. We need action in this regard. I am sure capital expenditure is required with regard to the plumbing system. I recognise that some money has been spent on it over a period of time. It is quite clear that more money needs to be spent. It is unsatisfactory that the shower units do not have a proper dispersal system at the end. It is certainly not suitable for the people in the hospital who are using them. This sends out the wrong message and needs to be addressed. If additional capital is required to address the issue, the Government should provide it immediately.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	355	I am responding to this Topical Issue matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar. I thank Deputy Kirk for giving me an opportunity to address the House on the important issue of the HIQA report on the threat of legionnaires' disease at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. I would like to apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who generally tries to be present to respond to Topical Issue debates that relate to his area of responsibility. I hope the Deputy understands that he is unable to be present today. The Minister will communicate that to the Deputy as well. HIQA identified a number of issues during an unannounced inspection of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda on 11 June last. A re-inspection was carried out on 16 July. The hospital has acknowledged the issues raised in the HIQA report relating to the national standards for the prevention and control of health care associated infections following inspections of the hospital in June and July 2015. The Minister is pleased to note that the hospital management team and the staff of the hospital have made a number of improvements and a great deal of progress in respect of all issues raised during HIQA's initial visit. The hospital has a robust governance structure in place for the management of all aspects of the national standards for the prevention and control of health care-associated infections. It has developed a quality improvement plan to address the remaining outstanding issues raised in the HIQA report. I understand the hospital has a system in place to manage actively all the processes that minimise the likelihood of legionella bacteria being in the water supply. This is to ensure a high level of protection for all patients and staff. I am also informed that the hospital is compliant with the legionella L8 approved code of practice. It is worth noting that there have been no hospital-acquired infections associated with Legionella bacteria at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. I would like to mention some of the measures that are in place at the hospital to ensure the quality of water supply. Water quality at the hospital is managed and governed by a multidisciplinary group that includes a consultant microbiologist. Copper-silver treatment of water is undertaken to eliminate legionella bacteria. The flushing of all low-use outlets is in place on a daily basis. The efficiency of treatment processes is subject to ongoing measurement, with monthly sampling of water. The Deputy asked how often it is sampled. Additional external independent sampling of the water supply for legionella takes place in accordance with the national standard. Monthly random testing is done at the point of water supply. I understand that in the past year, three samples have returned with a bacterial level that is higher than accepted norms. In all cases, the reasons for this have been identified and remedial action has been taken. The hospital has taken other steps to address issues arising from the HIQA report, including completing minor maintenance works, undertaking risk assessment in relation to access to sinks and making improvements with regard to staff training, audit and information display to ensure compliance with hygiene standards. I assure the House that the senior management team at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has an internal audit programme to assess compliance with the standards. The hospital is committed to providing health care services in an environment that maximises safety, quality and accountability and drives a culture of responsibility and accountability among all staff involved. The Deputy raised a number of additional questions that were not necessarily outlined in his initial submission for this Topical Issue debate. I will try to get all those answers for the Deputy over the next day or two and I will bring back his requests to the Minister.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	I thank the Minister of State for his response. It would be advantageous when Topical Issue debates are taken in this Chamber if a Minister or Minister of State representing the relevant Department could be present. I do not mean that as a criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy English. I know he is deputising for the Minister. I fully accept that Ministers and Ministers of State can be drawn away somewhere else. Their non-attendance can pose a problem, however, when we are discussing important issues. There is no point in minimising this one. The subliminal message from the phrasing of the text of the reply read by the Minister of State is that we should move on because there is nothing to worry about or see here. The reality is that there is. The HIQA report identified issues that need to be addressed urgently. I am sure it involves the expenditure of money on the plumbing and water supply and distribution systems within the hospital network. I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the sentiment of the House that this matter needs to be addressed urgently. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the busiest hospitals in the country. It caters for a huge population in its catchment area. It is simply unsatisfactory in this day and age to have the threat of legionnaires' disease hanging over the patients and staff of the hospital. I ask the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to address this.

He will accept that the Minister always tries to be here for Topical Issue debates when he can. His diary did not permit his attendance here today. He is certainly taking this issue very seriously. I will bring back to him the Deputy's additional questions and requests for information. It is important to point out that the hospital has implemented step changes since the report in July. Additional follow-up analysis has been done by HIQA. There are other steps being taken as well. I will certainly keep the Deputy updated on these matters. I will ask the Minister to engage with him with the full information as well. I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	358	While I appreciate that this topic has been chosen, I would have liked one of the Ministers or Ministers of State directly involved in this matter to be here to provide answers. I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy English, when I say that. It was rather difficult to find a relevant Minister this week. Given that next week is budget week, I did not want to take the chance of losing this Topical Issue matter completely by deferring this debate. While this is certainly a health issue, it is much more than that and it requires co-operation between the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Social Protection. I know this is not confined to Dublin but that is what I will speak about because that is what I know. The reality in Dublin is that communities are flooded with what are known as Z-drugs. These tablets are being used with other drugs and with alcohol and are causing havoc and distress. They are pushing people further into addiction and causing an awful lot of distress and pain for families and the wider community. They contribute in a major way to anti-social behaviour and criminality. Communities are looking at young men - and it is mainly men, some of whom are only in their late teens - openly selling these Z tablets. I could bring the Minister of State right now to a number of places in the north inner city where this open dealing is going on and he could buy whatever number of Z tablets he wanted. I could also bring him to the people who are living beside this open dealing who will tell him about the nightmare of living beside it. A very fine report was published some time ago, which all of the stakeholders in the various communities bought into, called A Better City for All. While it makes wonderful suggestions and recommendations, glaring gaps persist, such as this one regarding tablets. There is a lot of talking but no action on this matter. The Minister of State might say that this is a matter for the Garda, and it is, but its hands are completely tied because of the lack of appropriate legislation. Gardaí are being asked by the communities why they are allowing this drug dealing to continue. The answer is that they are powerless to do anything. Emergency legislation is needed, and I am reliably informed that if legislation were enacted to deal with Z-drugs, places could be cleaned up in a week. We would all like to see more gardaí on our streets, but in this case more gardaí is not the answer unless legislation is enacted which will enable them to do their work. Unfortunately, it would appear that these working class communities that are devastated by drugs are not high on the priority list. The difficulty is that there are two relevant Acts here, one being the Irish Medicines Board Act, which was amended in 2006, and the other being the Misuse of Drugs Act, but they contain loopholes. Neither Act is appropriate to deal with tablets because tablets are not controlled drugs. At the moment, if a garda has a reasonable suspicion that somebody is engaging in drug dealing, he or she can search that person. However, if tablets are found, the garda must give one third back to the person so that he or she can do his or her own individual testing. The issue of tablets has never been addressed and in the meantime it continues. It is causing havoc in communities. People are looking at this open drug dealing going on in their areas but they are not overly concerned as to whether it is heroin, ecstasy, cocaine or cannabis. They are concerned about the actual dealing, which is all part of that same milieu or world of drugs. It is open and blatant, but the hands of gardaí are tied.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this issue. She will be aware that the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, is out of the country and unable to respond personally. The Government's response to the problem of drug misuse in our society is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-16. The Minister of State is aware that in recent years the nature and scale of drug misuse has changed, with an increased prevalence of polydrug use and the use of Z-drugs, benzodiazepines and other prescription or non-prescription tablets, as Deputy O'Sullivan has just outlined. Treatment figures for 2013 indicate an increase in the number of people seeking treatment for benzodiazepine use. Z-drugs are prescription medicines and, as such, may be supplied by a registered pharmacist only on foot of a prescription. It is an offence to supply them by mail order. While it is not an offence to receive them, recipients are not entitled to possess them, and this provision is availed of by customs officers and the Health Products Regulatory Authority to confiscate such medicines. Some medicines, including Z-drug Zipeprol, are subject to stricter controls under the misuse of drugs regulations because of their high potential for abuse and misuse. A substantial amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 to introduce additional controls on benzodiazepines and Z-drugs was the subject of a consultation process. It included the introduction of import and export controls and tighter prescribing and dispensing rules. While substantial work was done on drafting these amended regulations, departmental resources had to be reallocated to deal with a challenge to the constitutionality of section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, under which the Government declares substances to be controlled under the Act. The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted in March 2015 following an adverse finding by the Court of Appeal. The 2015 Act also reconfirmed existing ministerial regulations and orders made under the 1977 Act, including the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988. This means that amendments are required to the Misuse of Drugs Act before any new regulations can be made. Work is under way on drafting a second Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to amend sections of the 1977 Act. The Bill is listed in the Government's legislative programme for publication in 2016. Of course, it is important to point out that the problem of abuse of Z-drugs will not be solved by regulations alone and that prescribers need to ensure that these controlled substances are only prescribed as appropriate and for a very limited time. Clinical guidelines are set out in the Department of Health's document, Good Practice Guidelines for Clinicians, for the prescribing of benzodiazepines. The HSE's addiction services provide a comprehensive substance treatment service orientated towards those with polydrug issues. Consequently, problem drug users attending such services who are dependent on benzodiazepines or Z-drugs have this addressed as part of their treatment. Clinical protocols for benzodiazepine treatment are currently under consideration by the national clinical effectiveness committee, and some HSE addiction services are piloting these protocols. The Department of Health is beginning work on the development of a new national drugs strategy. The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities, including treatment. Along with my colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Ó Ríordáin, I urge all interested parties to engage in the process. Deputy O'Sullivan is right that there is no one solution to this problem. It will require a combination of efforts from several Departments. It is not just a question of more gardaí or more legislation. A co-ordinated effort is required to tackle this problem. I do not have all of the answers to the Deputy's questions today, but I am sure that the Minister of State will respond to her in person in the coming days.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	360	I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, is aware of this because he has attended meetings of quite a number of community projects in the north inner city, as well as meetings of the North Inner City Drugs Task Force. Last September, I put a question to the Minister for Justice and Equality on this matter. At that time I was told that this is acknowledged as a problem in the Dublin city centre area. That was the gist of the answer I received. I was also told that An Garda Síochána continues to work closely with all of the relevant State agencies, but I have just outlined what gardaí are saying to me. I got that reply over a year ago, and in the meantime the situation has become much worse. We are not seeing the urgency that is needed here. I want to acknowledge the work of the drugs squad in Store Street and the sterling work of Inspector Des McTiernan for the urgency he has brought to this matter, but his hands are tied. That is the bottom line here. The answer I have just been given does not get to the kernel of the issue. The Minister of State has said that it is an offence to supply these tablets by mail order, but they are coming in all the time through the Internet and various other means. While it is not an offence to receive them, the recipient is not entitled to possess them, but people are possessing them all the time. Even when gardaí find people in possession of these Z-drugs there is nothing they can do about it.  If we ever get around to drafting the legislation referred to, we cannot just try to control the Z-drugs issue, because no sooner will that be controlled than we will have Y tablets or X tablets or some other drug, such is the inventiveness of the chemists and dealers. I have absolutely no doubt that Z-drugs will be replaced by something else, which is why there is a need to get people together who really know what they are talking about to work on the legislation.

As the Deputy herself said, this is an issue that cuts across several Departments, including Health and Justice and Equality. Unfortunately, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, could not be here today either. The Government is conscious that a co-ordinated effort is required and there will be an attempt during the drafting of the legislation due in 2016 to involve all of the relevant agencies to ensure that we put the best possible legislation in place. The new national drugs strategy, on which the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, will lead, is important, and it will adapt to the changes in society over the last four or five years. The strategy will ensure that we have the necessary legislation in place and the resources required to target the new phenomenon of abuse of Z-drugs. As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, this will change again in the coming years, so we need to have a drugs strategy that is capable of adapting to current crises in terms of the demand for certain drugs. I will relay all of the Deputy's concerns to the Minister of State at the earliest opportunity.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to discuss this important issue. This problem has come out of the blue. Supervisors of community employment schemes are discovering when renewing insurance premiums that the cost of insurance has increased by exorbitant sums. Some have been quoted a threefold increase in the cost of insurance, which is unprecedented. In addition, no indication is being given for the reasons these increases are being introduced at this time. Community employment schemes employ approximately 23,000 people nationwide. Increases in insurance premiums have become a feature of community employment schemes in the north inner city of Dublin. These increases are of major concern to stand-alone community employment schemes which do not have the wherewithal to pay them, whereas other schemes engaged in a broad area of activity may be able to soak up the increase. The materials grant provides the funding used to pay insurance premiums. With the allocation of materials grants for 2015 complete, it is not expected that the funding will be increased or extended to cover the unexpected increases in insurance costs that are coming on stream. Certain community employment schemes are finding that they do not have the wherewithal to pay the premium. I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is au fait with the issues involved. Allianz is the predominant company engaged in quoting insurance for community employment schemes, at least in the area I represent. This means competition is limited. The insurance industry should be consulted on this matter with a view to ensuring there is greater competition in this area. The Department must engage with the insurance companies to determine the grounds on which a threefold increase in premiums is being sought. To cite one example, the cost of insurance for the Dublin Adult Learning Centre, of which I am a director, has increased from €1,250 to €3,750 per annum. This quote came completely out of the blue. The centre provides schemes which have never lodged claims against the insurance industry. It is not a question of some bad claims being made and the company seeking to recoup some of the expenditure it has made. For this reason, it will be necessary to determine from Allianz the reason for the sudden increase in insurance premiums. Will it be possible in the short term for the Department to meet some of the additional insurance costs being incurred by community employment schemes? This could be done by extending the materials grant to address the imminent problems a number of schemes are facing.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I thank Deputy Costello for highlighting this issue, which has come to my attention only recently. He provided an example of the Dublin Adult Learning Centre, for which the insurance premium has increased by €2,500. This substantial increase was quoted without warning. I understand the reason the Deputy, as a director of the centre, community activist and public representative for Dublin, is concerned about the issue. Community employment schemes are required to procure annual liability insurance to cover their schemes. In recent months, sponsors have been advising the Department of increases in insurance premiums for schemes. The main reasons for these increases advised to the Department when this was queried with the insurance companies were claims cost inflation, an increase in claims frequency in recent years, changes in the courts' jurisdiction, and a reduction in income from insurers' investments.  The Department has been in consultation with the main insurers of community employment schemes about the increases with a view to ameliorating them and seeking to limit the incidence of future claims. The Department recommends, in the first instance, that scheme sponsors seek alternative quotes to ensure they obtain value for money. Insurance premium costs continue to be reimbursed from the community employment materials grants. Sponsors have been asked to be especially mindful of their legal obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and in respect of the supervision of the health and safety environment of their employees. Materials budgets are allocated on an annual basis and managed at divisional level. In general, the Department is not in a position to allocate additional moneys to the materials budget in 2015. However, if a scheme experiences particular difficulties, the sponsor should contact the local departmental office on the matter. Like Deputy Costello, I am acutely aware of what community employment does for local communities. Not only do these schemes assist long-term unemployed people to return to work but many also provide valuable services. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I share his concerns about the matter and I will continue to engage on it.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	I thank the Minister of State for his reply and note the points he made. The industry provided four reasons for the increase in the cost of insurance premiums, namely, claims cost inflation, an increase in claims frequency in recent years, changes in the courts' jurisdiction, and reductions in income from insurers' investments. It would be interesting to have these factors quantified by the insurance companies. The reasons given appear impressive and suggest that there has been a significant increase in the number of claims before the courts and so forth. Will the Department request a breakdown of the factors allegedly behind the increase in premiums? If it is the case that the cost of claims has increased, why have premiums suddenly increased threefold when one would expect them to increase on a phased basis? Did the increase in claims take place last year? Surely it occurred over a period of years, which would result in a gradual increase in premiums. The insurance companies involved are trying to put community employment schemes out of business. If a standalone scheme whose only source of income is the moneys allocated under the materials budget is unable to secure an increase in the materials grant to cover the cost of an increase in insurance premiums, it will find itself in difficulty. It will certainly be in a negative position with its bank and the materials grant it receives in 2016 may not cover outgoings it makes in 2015. This is a serious problem. It would be worthwhile inviting the industry to a meeting and encouraging it to engage more competitively in this area. A number of companies should quote rather than the limited number which quote currently. We must ensure the viability of any community employment scheme is not threatened by increases in insurance premiums. As the Minister of State noted, these schemes provide significant employment, support and experience for approximately 23,000 people. Moreover, participants change every couple of years. Community employment is at the cutting edge in terms of offering people who are unemployed an opportunity to re-engage with employment. Every effort must be made to ensure nothing undermines these schemes.

Two main insurance companies are involved in community employment. This issue was highlighted to the Department only recently. Until now, insurance for community employment schemes has cost approximately €50 per participant.It has been brought to my attention that for some participants it has now gone to between €82 and €125. That is an increase of between 64% and 104% in insurance costs. The Department would struggle to deal with that rate of increase. Certainly, the Deputy's questions are very pertinent. In the first instance, I ask the schemes to get another quote if possible and to engage with the individual management structure. It is a cause for concern, and I thank Deputy Joe Costello for raising it in the House today.

I have no doubt that she has a list the length of her arm of people who want new schools and new school buildings and I imagine the pressure on her at the moment is severe. However, it would be wrong to fail to raise the issue of Athenry vocational school with the Minister today. The school has been promised a new school building for many years. While the Minister will probably tell me in her reply how much the process has moved on with the location of a site and work to purchase it, the matter has been going on for so long that there is great frustration among parents, students and many others in the Athenry hinterland. We have heard for so long how close we were to getting a new school. At one stage, it was believed that parents, pupils and teachers would walk through the front door of a brand new school on 1 September 2014. That certainly did not happen. A great deal of good work has been done in the background, and I pay special tribute to Councillor Peter Feeney, who spent so much time trying to find the site for the new vocational school, but there is a great deal of frustration out there that this is not moving as quickly as it should. We are getting a lot of people saying it is very close or nearly there, but no one is willing to say what the timeline is, when the land will be purchased, when building will commence and when the school will move in. After meeting two weeks ago with the principal and some of the teachers, I note that what we really want today are answers. A further consideration is that in a town the size of Athenry, the Presentation school and the Gaelscoil are also looking for new buildings. The CSO figures show that Athenry is a booming town, the population of which continues to grow. Apple is going to make a massive investment in the next year. This is an area that is going places, but Athenry is short of the new schools it desperately needs. We must start to set out a very clear plan for the town of Athenry's building programmes and when they will start. We must move away from hearsay and maybes. The site is there and we need it to be purchased. We need to know when it will be purchased and when building will start. That is the only way to alleviate the frustration that parents and students face.

The Deputy is aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years. Funding under my Department's five-year construction plan is focused on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to accommodate increasing pupil numbers. This involves prioritising school building projects in areas where demographic demand is projected to exceed the level of accommodation available. Athenry has been identified as an area of demographic growth. In that regard, a major project to provide a new school building for Gairmscoil Mhuire, Athenry, to cater for 1,000 pupils has been included in the current five-year construction plan announced in 2012. A new site is required to accommodate this new school building. The Deputy will be aware that I signed a memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers' Association in 2012. The memorandum of understanding fosters increased levels of co-operation and formalises the role of local authorities in identifying and securing sites for educational use. In general, the first step in a site acquisition process is the identification of a number of suitable sites by the relevant local authority. The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authority and my Department. Subsequently, a valuation of the preferred site is procured and negotiations with the landowner are opened. Such negotiations may encompass the resolution of complex technical issues and, in that context, can be lengthy. Once agreement in principle with the landowner has been reached, the legal conveyancing process commences. In this instance, my Department has worked closely with Galway County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the school. In the course of the site acquisition process, some matters arose which required further technical assessment and consideration. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all of these technical matters have now been addressed to the extent that the site acquisition can proceed. I have been informed by my officials that, subject to no issues arising, it is expected that contracts can be signed shortly. I am afraid I have to use the word "shortly," even though the Deputy wants something more specific. It will then be possible for the project to proceed to architectural planning. I assure the Deputy that the project to provide a new permanent building for Gairmscoil Mhuire, Athenry, will be progressed as soon as possible. Officials from my Department will be in contact with Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board in that regard as soon as the site acquisition is completed. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dail the current position regarding the site, although I am not sure I have told him anything he did not already know. It is important to note that "shortly" means "in the very near future."

I welcome the fact that a lot of the technical issues have been sorted out and that we are very much nearing the end of the process. However, I ask the Minister and her officials to redouble their efforts to get this over the line as soon as possible. Having met parents and, in particular, teachers, I note that although this is a school with a proud history and a bright future, they are teaching in a school that is not fit for 2015 and are in desperate need of a new premises. They grow frustrated daily at words such as "shortly." I understand that conveyancing can take time and that legal issues can arise, but it is important to get around them as soon as possible. If possible, we should put timelines in place within the next month or two. The Minister noted in her speech that Athenry is a booming town, and I invite her to visit the three schools in the town to make herself aware of the concerns people have. It will be an ideal opportunity for her to see that the town is going places. We need to bring these schools up to the necessary standard, and I urge the Minister and her officials to get the matter over the line as soon as possible. Let us get building this school, because Athenry and Gairmscoil Mhuire deserve a new school in 2015.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves Ireland's accession to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a Battlegroup to be made available to the European Union in the second half of the year 2016.The memorandum has already been signed by the other participants in the battle group, namely, Germany, Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. I agree with the point made by many that the term "battle group" is unfortunate and misleading. It describes the force size rather than its role and is a standard technical military term for a battalion-sized force with support elements comprising 1,500 personnel. Their role is to provide an initial entry force in a crisis management or humanitarian situation or to reinforce an existing mission. They would be better described as a rapid response group or a peace management force. EU battle groups have a readiness to deploy within five to ten days on a range of possible missions, sustainable for 30 days and extendable to 120 days. I will briefly outline the background to Ireland's participation in the German battle group. The ambition of the EU is to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises. This is a key objective in the continued development of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, CDSP. The purpose of the battle groups is to undertake operations known as the Petersberg Tasks. These include, inter alia, humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, joint disarmament operations, military advice, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation. A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations. In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. Our commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations. Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and the maintenance of international peace and security. Concerns are sometimes expressed that our participation in battle groups may pose a threat to our military neutrality. This, of course, is not the case. Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected by our participation. The guarantees under the Lisbon treaty and Ireland's declaration make this clear. We are not and will not become part of any military alliance or permanent military formation. We will not enter into any mutual defence arrangement. That position remains unchanged. In the case of battle groups, each participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation. Equally, each battle group participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time. As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will be subject to the triple lock, which Deputies understand. It is also worth recalling the strong support of the UN for the EU's efforts in this regard. During his visit to Ireland in May, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, commented positively on the EU-UN relationship and the importance of having a rapid reaction capacity. While no battle group has deployed to date, which is much to the frustration of some nations, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits to developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states. Ireland's active engagement in battle groups and across the range of activity under the Union's CDSP enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU and helps to shape policy in a manner that is consistent with our values and our support of multilateralism and for the UN. The Defence Forces' contribution to this battle group will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate. The Defence Forces' commitment will involve a reconnaissance and intelligence company, together with staff posts at the operational and force headquarters. The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved will be approximately 175. Their role will be to generate and deliver specific information and intelligence to decision makers in support of the planning and conduct of operations. Eight officers and two NCOs are deployed to the battle group headquarters in Strasbourg and engage in training and planning activities. In summary, Ireland's participation in the battle group will continue to support the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability. It will enhance Ireland's credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations and reinforce our standing and ability to influence the ongoing development of the CDSP in support of international peace and security and the EU's relationship with the UN. I commend the motion to the House.

In 2010, the most recent Fianna Fáil defence Minister, Mr. Tony Killeen, stated: "Ireland's participation in EU Battlegroups is a tangible means of showing our support for the EU as a provider of high quality peacekeepers to United Nations mandated operations." We as a party reject any assertion that taking part in battle groups undermines our neutrality. Rather, it is a way of bolstering our commitment to the United Nations. The UN is the third strand of the triple lock, to which we remain committed. We are strong and committed supporters of collective security through the UN. In 1945, when we first applied to join it, Éamon de Valera observed:It is the small nations particularly that should welcome an organisation which is intended to give collective security. But the small nations, just like the big ones, will, if they become members of such an organisation, have to be really loyal members of it. They will have to make up their minds that the obligations which are necessary, if the organisation is to be successful, will be fulfilled and carried out.The EU battle group is a way of fulfilling that commitment. Our Defence Forces are keen to participate in battle groups. Ireland has a long tradition of overseas service in support of UN or UN-mandated deployments in pursuit of international peace and security since the first Defence Forces deployment abroad in 1958. We are all aware of the high level of pride in and public recognition of the work that our Defences Forces do. It is no harm to mention the work that our naval forces are currently engaged in the Mediterranean. The Defence Forces also provide personnel to the EU stand-by battle group rapid response brigades, even though no EU battle group has to date deployed into a mandated mission. Overseas service deployments by the Defence Forces are a pivotal element of Irish foreign policy and for the attainment of Defence Forces operational capability across a wide spectrum of challenging military, geopolitical and geostrategic environments. Defence Forces personnel of all ranks have and continue to excel in overseas deployments, be they at strategic, operational or tactical level. The continued participation of Defence Forces units, contingents and individual members is essential for individual and unit professional development, unit operational viability and cohesion. When contingents deploy, they must be in formations of sufficient strength and composition that the leadership functions of all ranks and military specialisations are fully maximised. Deploying numbers of small units in different missions concurrently is not consistent with optimum operational capacity advancement or outputs once deployed. A mix over time of "ground holding" and "mission rapid reaction" unit operational postures is the most beneficial strategically to the Defence Forces and the missions on which they operate. The deployment of personnel from the Air Corps and the Naval Service in cohesive unit strength, along with their aircraft and ships as required, must be progressively and positively pursued as a means of contributing specialist unit capability to UN, UN-mandated or Chapter VIII missions.Ongoing Defence Forces deployments in the Middle East, the Balkans and recently in Africa have increased linkages to Ireland's international wish to reinforce its political and diplomatic platforms and visibility, together with its concurrent economic and business connectivity and trade ambitions. This ambition and action is consistent with Ireland's place in the world as a valued and trusted United Nations and European Union member.

Sinn Féin is committed to an independent and progressive Irish international relations policy with Irish neutrality at its core. Sinn Féin's support for neutrality is the product of a well-developed and coherent republican position stretching over 200 years of Irish history. Our interpretation of sovereignty of the people and national self-determination includes the freedom to determine one's relationships with other nations. This motion pertains to Ireland's participation in a EU battle group from July to December 2016 with Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Croatia. Each of the 18 battle groups consists of a battalion-sized force of 1,500 troops reinforced with combat support elements. The formation of battle groups allows the European Union to deploy troops and military equipment quickly to regions as far as 6,000 km from Brussels for a minimum of 30 days, which can be extended to 120 days if they are resupplied. They are designed as a rapid reaction force that can deploy anywhere within that range, supposedly within six days. While some people try to portray these battle groups as humanitarian soldiers, their ultimate purpose is right there in the name - that is, they are primarily established to go into battle. Sinn Féin considers these battle groups to be more about military powers in Europe wishing to push Europe in a certain direction militarily than about a sense of responsibility to peacekeeping. Just as with the euro, it is possible to be a member of the European Union and not support or participate in its militarisation via the battle groups. While some neutral countries such as Austria are taking part, Malta does not, and Denmark, which is a NATO member, has an opt-out for this and all other areas of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.

A report by the Transnational Institute and the Dutch Campaign against Arms Trade has found that high levels of European military spending played a key role in the unfolding EU debt crisis and continue to undermine efforts to resolve the debt crisis. It is clear these battle groups aim to promote increased military spending during times of austerity while the funding of essentials such as schools, hospitals and nursing homes is cut. It makes no sense that Europe is spending more on its militaries then was the case ten years ago-----

One is told the Cold War has ended, but the stockpiling of nuclear and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction by some countries continues to pose a major and serious threat to international security and human survival. To ensure we live in a safer and more equal world, increased military expenditure certainly is not a solution. It is necessary to challenge the structures that cause poverty and insecurity. Many have tried to make a false distinction between neutrality and non-neutrality. If a country is neutral, that does not mean it does nothing to help innocent civilians who are affected by war or does not try to tackle poverty, inequality and social injustice, which are the primary triggers for war. A policy of positive neutrality would ensure this State would not increase its military spending, take part in the arms trade or profit from conflicts or wars. Our focus should be on guaranteeing the economic, social, political and cultural rights of people worldwide while aiming to assist people to lift themselves out of poverty and hunger. It should be on working with countries to implement global targets on issues such as land rights, citizen participation, tax justice, government accountability and making the world a safer and more equal place. A Red C poll commissioned by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance on 17 September 2013 showed that eight out of ten Irish people are in favour of neutrality, which is a massive and unprecedented number. In considering the record of this State, particularly with regard to Shannon Airport, it is hard to escape the conclusion that consecutive Governments have pursued policies to abandon incrementally the twin policies of neutrality and United Nations primacy in favour of a hybrid that abandons both.

The issue is that in other European countries, the establishments need not pretend to be in favour of neutrality in the manner of Fine Gael, which occasionally doffs the hat towards neutrality while at the same time agitating against the policy of neutrality. Members should be aware that Ireland is committing 175 soldiers to be part of the battle group led and effectively organised by the German military command, which can put 3,000 soldiers on the ground. The kind of equipment being made available by the Irish Defence Forces includes an Orbiter unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, as well as communications and sniper equipment. The first of these, the UAV, is a military drone, which, together with the sniper rifles, means this is not about helping people affected by natural disasters but is about going to war. This supposedly neutral country, which allows American weaponry to land in Shannon Airport on the way to Iraq and Afghanistan, where it will kill innocent people, proposes to be available for participation in a battle group. I am not asking Members to trust me about this; they should trust Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, a former Secretary General of NATO, who stated that EU battle groups could be used to go to war. He said:Why is the EU creating battlegroups? It is not just to help rebuild a country. The battlegroups are not [there] for building schools ... we shouldn't think the EU is for soft power and Nato for tough power.Alternatively, Members should listen to the words of the Minister under questioning at the committee, where he stated:Essentially, what it means is that we do not want to be restricted to humanitarian assistance only. There are missions that may necessitate disarmament.EU battle groups are a key drive in the way of militarisation-----

It is a key means of driving European militarisation, but also integration with NATO, hence the increased spending in recent years on defence in Ireland to ensure military interoperability with NATO. I am with James Connolly in this regard when he stated:We have held, and do hold, that war is a relic of barbarism only possible because we are governed by a ruling class with barbaric ideas; we have held, and do hold, that the working class of all countries cannot hope to escape the horrors of war until in all countries that barbaric ruling class is thrown from power.

The key objective is not a secret at all, in that EU battle groups were set up to provide a military force directly under the control of the EU political elite and the EU structures that are dominant there. It is part of an increased militarisation across Europe, and I must note that the Minister is in the camp of the hawks in this regard, very much accelerating the process. The Minister is correct that it is not just a case of having the battle groups present; there is currently an acute drive to have them deployed against the backdrop of the drive towards increased EU military expenditure. As Deputy Crowe noted, this is precisely at a time when austerity is raining on the heads of ordinary citizens. If one takes the recent example of the Russian war planes accused of incursions over Turkey and the Baltic states, such events could spark an incident in which the German battle groups would be deployed, and Irish soldiers would be participating.

If you don’t want to call it a European army, don’t call it a European army. You can call it “Margaret”, you can call it “Mary-Ann”, you can find any name, but it is a joint effort ... the first time you have a joint, not bilateral, effort at European level.That is what is under discussion in the Chamber at present. An Irish entanglement in military alliances makes us complicit. It is an absolute affront to the citizens of the State, who believe in our neutrality.It is part of a process that sees us joining the NATO Partnership for Peace, which everyone knows is a training ground for full NATO membership, and it goes hand in hand with our complicity in the daily use of Shannon Airport and in the revelations produced by Shannon Watch last week of the hundreds of permissions granted last year for overflights and landings for war planes on the way to Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, where innocent civilians are being slaughtered. We are complicit in that process and this is part of that. It has no place in a country which proclaims its neutrality, and we will be opposing it.

It is my pleasure to introduce the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill 2012 on Second Stage. The Bill will provide for the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the transfer of its function to Dublin City Council, which will guide the future development of the area in partnership and collaboration with local stakeholders. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a consultative forum to ensure that the views of interested parties in the docklands areas, including local communities, businesses and key local actors, will be recognised and considered in any future development of the area. If you will indulge me for a few moments, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will spend a little time reflecting on the growth, demise and restoration of the docklands area to what it is at present. From the preceding two centuries up to the 1960s, the docklands area was a vibrant port area for Dublin, servicing the import and export functions of the capital and, more widely, the country. As a thriving port, it engendered the usual port-related industries such as boat-building, chandlery, rope-making and other ancillary trades. It also contributed to the establishment of other industries, such as grain milling and storage, coal and fuel distribution, metal foundries and warehousing. This gave rise to inner city employment and the establishment of an indigenous community servicing the needs of the enterprises located there. Regrettably, in those times the standard of housing and accommodation for the residents of the docklands reflected the generally poor conditions that prevailed among the working classes in the city. Notwithstanding this, the area had a rich cultural tradition which contributed to the unique character of Dublin, as reflected in the music, literature and other art forms from those times. The decline in docklands generally in the 1960s can be attributed mainly to two factors. Freight containerisation led to a reduction in the need for manpower at the quayside, as well as the need for greater deep-water facilities to service the increasing tonnage of the vessels designed for this purpose. Moreover, the demand for improved living standards for all our citizens in a modern economy led to the provision of better housing and a migration from the inner city to the new suburbs on the outskirts of the city. Through this population shift, the inner city population in the 20th century shrank by over 50%, and most of the indigenous industries also relocated, mainly for reasons of access to the outskirts as well. The Dublin docklands area went into decline, and by the 1980s many parts had become run down and abandoned. The first agency established to start redressing this situation was the Custom House Docks Development Authority, set up in 1986 to stimulate development on the north side of the docklands area. It utilised a range of financial incentives to lure investment to the area. Over the course of its ten-year existence it facilitated considerable office and residential development in the Custom House Quay area, most notably the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre, better known as the IFSC, which now comprises 111,500 sq. m and employs close to 5,000 people. In order to widen the scope of the development of the entire docklands area, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, was established under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997. Covering a much larger area extending to both sides of the River Liffey, the DDDA was responsible for the sustainable social, economic and physical regeneration of the docklands, in addition to the continued development of the financial sector of the economy, and was required to prepare a master plan for achieving these objectives. Central to this strategy was the use of fast-track planning under section 25 of the Act, which allowed for a shortening of the timeframes for approval of developments as long as proposals were aligned with the master plan and local planning schemes. The master plan for the docklands allowed for the integrated and sustainable development of a once-neglected area of the city, with appropriate levels of community input and, as a consequence, substantial community gain.  The input of various elements of the residential and business communities, as well as State entities with an interest in the docklands, was facilitated through their membership of the Docklands Council, which considered matters pertaining to the development of the docklands and the relationships that existed between them. Through the nomination of community representatives and local elected officials, together with representatives from business, education, and other bodies, the voices of all were heard and heeded. Further evidence of the commitment to local communities can be seen in the establishment of the Docklands Housing Trust, which was set up to administer social housing provision for the indigenous docklands population and has 72 housing units which it allocates within its remit. I am pleased to confirm that the housing trust will continue this worthwhile endeavour under the new arrangements, with support from the housing division of Dublin City Council. Additionally, the Docklands Community Trust was established and was allocated funds on an incremental basis to invest in initiatives, supports and schemes to the benefit of the community. Currently, that fund stands at €1.3 million, and over the years the trust has used interest and earnings from its investments to finance community initiatives, most notably in the area of higher education grants for local students. Again, I am pleased to say that the trust will continue to play this vital support role, albeit redirecting its benefits through the new docklands consultative forum, which will come into being under this dissolution Bill. The DDDA has contributed greatly to the redevelopment of the docklands environment over the years, and it is appropriate to reflect on its achievements. Since its inception in 1997, what was once a derelict part of the city has been transformed into a vibrant neighbourhood and progressive economic area, housing some of the most prestigious international and domestic companies. Of the original 89 ha encompassed by the IFSC, North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock areas, 67 ha have been redeveloped, with the 22 ha remaining now subject to the successor to the fast-track planning mechanism of the DDDA Act, the recently approved strategic development zone, SDZ, administered by Dublin City Council, which came in force in May 2014. Most of the indigenous port-related industries have been replaced and the area is now a hive of activity, mainly involving international finance, thanks to the establishment and evolution of the IFSC and major international IT companies. There has been significant social regeneration of the area and the vibrant local community is central to its continuing development. Under the projections for its development, the population is expected to swell by almost 6,000 in the coming years. The interests of the residents are central to the integrated and sustainable growth of that community. Through the involvement of representatives on the docklands community forum, as well as of local public representatives on Dublin City Council, those interests will continue to be recognised and nurtured. The area has also become a hub for the entertainment sector, with a number of spectacular venues playing host to domestic and international talent. In general, it can be said that what was once a run-down area of Dublin has been transformed into a modern and remodelled living environment. The economic crash that hit our economy in 2008 was chiefly generated by an overheated building and property sector. This Administration, since coming into office, has strived to redress the inadequacies in financial, planning and building regulation while simultaneously pursuing policies to kick-start a moribund building industry. Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, so too does an ebbing tide see them all lower again, and the DDDA was no exception to this rule. The misfortune that befell the sector also saw it suffer significant losses on projects that had seemed like blue ribbon investments back in the heady days of the development boom.  Following consideration of a special report on the DDDA prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the authority’s own 2011 annual report and financial statements, the Government made the difficult but correct decision that the authority should be wound up and that the future responsibility and co-ordination of activity in the area should revert to Dublin City Council, ensuring that we keep the best of what has worked and plan a new approach and strategy for the further development and enhancement of the docklands. Elements of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report made for grim reading, particularly those relating to the authority’s assessment and decision-making processes surrounding its decision in 2006 to become involved in the purchase of the former Irish Glass Bottle site, an episode which has cost the authority €52 million, not to mention the associated reputational damage. In regard to the 2011 annual report and financial statements, while it was of course welcome to see the authority having recorded a small surplus, its first for several years, the future financial outlook for the authority presented a very different picture. Indeed, the reality emerging from the 2011 financial statements and the special report was that the authority’s financial position was inevitably going to remain very challenging in the short to medium term, given the economic downturn and the stressed state of the property market, from which the DDDA has historically derived its main revenues. Taking all of these factors into account, the inescapable conclusion was that a standalone DDDA was no longer viable, financially or otherwise. It is for these reasons that the Government decided on 29 May 2012 that the authority should be wound up. In taking this decision, the Government was acutely aware of the need to maintain and build on the good work of the authority. The Government remains fully committed to the continued regeneration of the Dublin docklands as an ambitious and visionary project. A number of key objectives were central to the process of finalising appropriate arrangements for ensuring a continued, concerted focus on the docklands regeneration initiatives. They were: maintaining and enhancing the docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment and high-value development; providing for an appropriate set of fast-track planning procedures; continuing to involve the local community and the business sector in the regeneration project; and facilitating job creation. The Government decided that Dublin City Council is best placed to continue the visionary docklands project. The development of docklands in the future will, therefore, be part of the integrated forward planning section of Dublin city as a whole within the remit of the city council. Let me now turn to the Bill before this House and its key provisions. As the wind-up process of the DDDA took effect, it became clear that significant primary legislation would be needed to resolve many of the outstanding issues and ensure the continued development of the docklands area. This is, in effect, what this Bill is providing for.  The Bill is divided into five Parts. Part 1 deals standard legislative provisions, including citation, commencement, definitions, regulations and expenses of the Minister. Part 2 deals with the dissolution of the authority. Part 3 deals with the matters that will apply following the dissolution of the DDDA and the transfer of its functions to Dublin City Council. Part 4 deals with planning and development matters. Part 5 deals with the establishment of the docklands consultative forum. The Bill went through a very thorough pre-legislative scrutiny process by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. This was a very useful process and I have endeavoured to incorporate many of their recommendations into the Bill. In Part 1 of the Bill, section 1 contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as the Short Title, collective citation and commencement. Section 2 provides the definitions used throughout the Act and deals with matters such as defining the Dublin docklands area, the master plan, the docklands planning schemes and public authority, among others. Sections 3 and 4 contain standard legislative provisions regarding such matters as regulations and expenses of the Minister. Part 2 of the Bill provides, in sections 5 and 6, for the dissolution of the authority on a day to be appointed by the Minister and provides that the authority shall stand dissolved on the appointed dissolution day. Part 3 of the Bill - sections 7 to 15, inclusive - provides for the seamless transition of functions and transfer of certain liabilities and assets to Dublin City Council. It is important that the development and oversight of the docklands area continues uninterrupted and that the momentum that has come back into the economy in recent years is harnessed to deliver impetus to the area.In recent times, with a recovering economic outlook and strong commercial demand for city centre premises, interest in the docklands area has reignited and there are tangible signs and prospects of recovery, which we need to manage in a sustainable and integrated way. When the decision was made to dissolve the authority in 2012, it was important to do so in a structured manner. The DDDA executive board devised a transition plan which would see an orderly wind-up of the company, allowing it to reduce its staffing level from 55 at its peak to zero in recent years. Apart from the contract staff, whose contracts expired in due course, all of the permanent staff either retired or were redeployed to other public bodies and entities, and their contingent pension liabilities have been calculated and are proposed to be transferred to Dublin City Council under section 14 of the Bill. This effectively places the liability for pension payments to former staff now and in the future with the council. Latest estimates from the authority put the pension liability at approximately €7 million to €8 million. To manage this reduction and redistribution of its staff, the running of the authority was overseen initially by consultant administrators and latterly by the newly formed docklands unit of Dublin City Council, which will be responsible for the future servicing of the planning and development needs of the docklands. This transfer of functions to the city council is provided for under section 7 of the Bill. As with all entities, there are always some outstanding issues of a legal and financial nature that need to be addressed, resolved or provided for as they may arise in the future, and while stringent efforts have been made to resolve these prior to dissolution, provision has been made in the Bill for any matters that need to be dealt with to be transferred to Dublin City Council under sections 9 and 10. Specifically, section 8 transfers all property and land from the authority to the council on dissolution day. Of primary concern for the Government was that this process should not require any Exchequer intervention and that an orderly asset disposal strategy would ensure optimum value was realised on the authority’s assets on hand. Over the course of recent years, this policy has ensured there are adequate funds to discharge all its liabilities and also make a generous contribution to Docklands Community Trust, which benefits the residents of the area, of which I will say more later. The latest estimates available show there will be assets to the value of €7 million to €8 million, not including the commitment to community gain, comprising funds in the bank and properties such as the offices of the authority on the quay front, and the ducting and Wi-Fi networks. The fourth Part of the legislation, sections 16 to 31, deals with outstanding and future planning matters. The planning schemes that had been prepared following the docklands master plan are being discontinued, as is the master plan itself, as set out under section 16. Section 17 further provides that the authority will no longer accept applications under the planning schemes. One of the main priorities for the Government, having decided to wind up the authority, was to ensure continued access to an appropriate and an effective fast-track planning system. To fulfil this objective, the Government decided in 2012 that a strategic development zone, SDZ, would be established for the docklands area. The docklands SDZ planning scheme was approved by An Bord Pleanála in May of last year and is now fully operational. This replacement fast-track planning system, which already operates in a number of urban locations around the country, allows for the rapid processing of applications which conform to the overall planning scheme now in place in the area. Sections 18 to 27 propose the putting in place of a robust system to deal with residual planning issues. For example, under section 20, planning certificates which had been granted under section 25 of the 1997 DDDA Act will now cease to be valid if the developments covered by them have not been substantially commenced at dissolution day, as determined by Dublin City Council. Section 25 certificates for developments that are deemed to be substantially commenced but are incomplete when the provisions of the enacted Bill are commenced will be granted an appropriate period of two years in which to finish out the development. In what would be deemed exceptional circumstances, provision is also made under section 23 to extend the appropriate period of two years by a further period not exceeding three years to allow for completion of the development covered by the section 25 certificate. This extension would be granted on the basis that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which prevent completion within the appropriate period. The officials have established that the outstanding uncompleted section 25 certificates are few in number and minor in scale, and I do not envisage a great demand for extensions to the appropriate period of up to three years for developments to reach completion. It is encouraging to note that new applications for development projects in the docklands are being made under the new strategic development zone provisions that I outlined earlier. I am glad to see the developers in question are adopting a pragmatic approach and ensuring their applications are in compliance with the new planning schemes unveiled under the SDZ. To further ease the transition to the new planning schemes, I have made provision in the Bill, under section 28, to allow applications under section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 covering the elements of developments not completed under section 25 certificates, while retaining those parts that are validly completed, subject to their satisfying the application criteria. One of the key drivers of the regeneration of this part of the city was to arrest the decline in economic activity and reverse the depopulation of the docklands that had resulted from the factors I outlined earlier. A vibrant community is the beating heart of any neighbourhood, and the remaining population in these environs are proud and supportive of their area. The 1997 Act established on a statutory basis a Docklands Council, which included representatives of local communities, public representatives for the vicinity and members from the economic and business community, as well as delegates from public bodies with a remit relevant to the docklands area. These included personnel from the educational, transportation and arts sectors, to name but a few. A collaborative approach to identifying and addressing problems and issues affecting the community allowed the Docklands Council to give valuable feedback to the DDDA regarding the ongoing development of the area, as well as having a key role in shaping the five-yearly master plans. Besides the influx of investment which resulted in economic renewal, much-needed employment was created for the area. The educational and cultural needs of the community were similarly addressed and funds were provided via the Docklands Community Trust for investment to the benefit of the people in the areas covered. Many local students availed of funding for higher education from this source and they might not have been able to pursue their studies and careers without this resource. It is equally important that the entities that exist in the docklands area continue to assist in shaping the future direction of the development of this part of the city. To this end, Part 5 of the Bill, sections 32 to 44, provides for a docklands consultative forum, which will continue the valuable collaborative input that its predecessor, the Docklands Council, has made since its inception. Section 34 of the Bill provides for the membership of the forum, which will be similarly structured to the council and will have 21 members and an independently appointed chair. It is proposed that community representatives will have five members and four members will be locally elected representatives. The remaining membership will consist of five members from the business community in the docklands area, five members from public authorities with a remit in the area, one member representing the educational sector and an officer of the council to oversee this group, having an important role in advising Dublin City Council and others on the best strategies to preserve the rich heritage of the area, the most appropriate policies to pursue in economic regeneration and the most valuable input in shaping the docklands as a vibrant and sustainable living space for its current and future residents. This vision will be brought into being by legislatively underpinning the functions of the docklands consultative forum. Section 33 of the Bill provides for the function of the forum, which is to consider and advise the council and its strategic policy committees on the formulation, development, monitoring and review of the council’s policies as they apply to the docklands area, and specifically on enterprise and employment, education, housing, planning, the environment and community. The consultative forum has a wide-ranging but important brief, and I expect the city council to work closely and co-operatively with the forum to enhance the conditions and environment of the residents in the docklands area. The proposed future regeneration of the area could see its resident population swell by more than 5,800, which will present challenges and opportunities for all its inhabitants in time. Of course, one of the main drivers of the welfare of a community is employment and fair incomes. The SDZ envisages that the development of the remaining docklands areas will give a much-needed boost to job creation in the area. In the construction phase and the provision of ancillary services, it is anticipated that local people will gain from the opportunities that will inevitably arise. The use of local employment clauses, though not part of the Bill, will be encouraged and advanced by Dublin City Council in consultation with the consultative forum, the National Asset Management Agency and other developers where appropriate.The projections for long-term employment suggest that, when completed, the docklands area will sustain an increase of 23,000 jobs above its current level. The recent influx of international businesses to the area and the continuing interest in locating in this part of the capital suggests that the growth in these areas will continue. Furthermore, I will request Dublin City Council to engage actively with officials of the Department of Social Protection to facilitate greater use of the available labour activation measures in the docklands area. One of the aspects of the docklands that has not been adequately harnessed in the past is its immense historical, cultural and artistic heritage. As with any community, the docklands has over the centuries contributed to the rich tapestry of the history and life of Dublin. The upcoming centenary of the 1916 Rising highlights the part played by this area in that momentous event, and Boland’s mills and associated buildings will no doubt be centre stage in the upcoming commemorations. The maritime tradition, as well as the industrial tradition of docklands, affords us an opportunity to preserve this heritage and share it with visitors who would like to explore the past in an informative and sympathetic environment. In recent months, my Department has facilitated an initiative to bring together the main interests in this area with a view to developing an integrated approach that will both preserve this legacy and harness its tourism and commercial potential. What was once a derelict and forgotten part of the city may in time become one of the premier attractions for foreign and domestic tourists alike. I and my colleagues in the Government foresee a bright future for the docklands area and I hope that in time the process we have put in train with this Bill will bear handsome rewards for us all. The regeneration of the area will lead to a more appealing cityscape, a more pleasant living space and increased prosperity for all. Within the context of the Dublin city development plan, it will play a pivotal role in the improving economic position for the capital and the country as a whole. Therefore, I commend this Bill to the House.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	396	We support this Bill and the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA. It was established in 1997 to be the lead driver of regeneration in the Dublin docklands area but we acknowledge that major mistakes were made by the body, most significantly in the Irish Glass Bottle site fiasco. Nevertheless, the decision to designate the 66 ha in the docklands area as a special planning zone has, overall, been a success. This area has become part of the central business district in Dublin city and an engine of growth for the greater Dublin area. The docklands area has much development potential for commercial and residential development but this remains the case, many would say, due to the failures of the Government; the residential units are not being built at the rate required to meet the massive demand for housing in core city centre areas. The special planning powers for the docklands must be backed up by real action by the Government to revitalise construction levels. As I stated, we welcome the dissolution of the DDDA but its role in resolving fire safety issues at the Longboat Quay complex has to be subsumed by Dublin City Council. We believe that until an agreement can be reached between residents and the DDDA, and until such time as costs can be recouped from the receivership process, Dublin City Council should meet the up-front expenses required to keep the residents in their homes. That would include the cost of remedial works. We welcome that, as under the DDDA, fast-track planning powers are being retained for the docklands, which will allow the council to grant development permission that cannot be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Much potential remains in this strategic zone and up to 2,600 new homes and 350,000 sq m of commercial space could be built. It is essential that the area can be developed further as an engine of growth for the city as a whole. There is much scope for residential development within the docklands zone but in many ways the area is symptomatic of wider issues in the private construction and rental markets in Dublin city. Despite the massive supply problem and out of control rental market, figures indicate that house and apartment completions continue to stall this year. There is development potential for over 2,600 housing units in the area but despite the attractiveness of the docklands area, residential development appears to be stalled. Completions for each of the four Dublin local authorities from January to March this year are very low and nowhere near what is required. Only 652 houses were completed in Dublin for the first three months of 2015, and based on these levels, the greater Dublin area may only have 2,600 new houses completed this year, compared with 2,591 in 2014. There has been no increase and it is likely there will be none. This issue exists while there is an overall requirement for 20,000 residential units per year, with an immediate need - this year alone - for 6,000 units in Dublin. We must ask why there is an absence of new housing construction across the city despite the massive unmet housing demand. The actual level of house building is much lower than the Government's completion figures suggest. The figures used by many Government sources in recent weeks and months, for example, relate to ESB connections but these do not automatically correlate with new house completions. The difference must be realised and publicised in order to let people know that real need is not being met. In 2014 there were only 8,700 new homes built but the Housing Agency estimates that at least 16,000 new homes are required for each year for the next four years specifically. The lack of supply in Dublin means that despite rent increases of more than 11% in Dublin this year, next year may well be much worse. With less than 30% of current demand for new homes being achieved in 2015, it is most likely the rent increases will be even greater next year. It is unfortunate that there appears to be no policy to deal with this growing housing crisis and what I have outlined has exacerbated the housing supply issue. We acknowledge that a strong regulatory structure is vital to ensuring high quality home building across the country. The examples of Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and Milford Manor are a sharp reminder of this. However, the new framework approved by the Government and passed earlier this year is convoluted, difficult to manage, costly and it may not be fit for purpose. The Minister introduced new fire safety regulations in March 2014 but this is just another system of self-regulation that will not provide enough protection against negligent developers. There may be a greater recourse to liability under the assigned certifier as contained in that system, but it is still a self-regulated regime, whereby the professional issuing the fire safety certificate is employed directly by the developer. This is a clear conflict of interest but the bar for sanction and disqualification has deliberately been set very high, with removal from a professional register being a very remote possibility for members only in the event of gross misconduct. We have learned through bitter experience, unfortunately, that self-regulation of fire regulations does not work. We firmly believe that State authorities must check every new development to ensure they are fire-safe. Many would argue that there is a process within existing legislation and local authority powers for enforcement offices in the planning departments. It is my contention that these are resourced with neither the manpower nor funds to be the regulatory force they can be. Failure to have adequately funded or resourced these offices has left us in a position where that avenue cannot be used to nip much of this in the bud before it becomes a real issue.The new inspection regime has done nothing to increase public safety. It has massively increased the cost of building new homes for those who employ these certifiers, whose qualification levels are such that they can charge the sort of amounts that are being bandied about. I know that process is under review. Perhaps this offers an opportunity to address the wider issue regarding the regulatory process that needs to be put in place, whether it is an independent authority, with the requisite jurisdiction, or local authorities, with sufficient funds, resources and manpower in the enforcement offices to allow them to carry out that duty. It is completely unacceptable that residents of the Longboat Quay apartments would be expected to foot the bill for making their homes safe. These problems are through no fault of those homeowners who trusted that the building had passed inspection and, therefore, was safe and habitable. However, as has been stated both inside and outside the House in recent weeks - particularly as many Members have come into direct contact with those affected - the residents are terrified that they will be thrown out on the street on the orders of Dublin Fire Brigade. We believe, as I said earlier, that Dublin City Council, while not assuming ultimate liability - although it must be noted that the developer is now in liquidation - cannot allow a situation to develop where these homeowners will be forced to pick up the tab. I know questions must be answered with regard to who bears responsibility but, as I said earlier, until an agreement can be made between the residents and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and the cost can be recouped from the receivership process. Dublin City Council, as the lead authority which is subsuming the powers of the DDDA, should meet upfront expenses required to keep the residents in their homes, including the cost of remedial works, which, we are informed, will be in the region of €4 million. While the refurbishment of Priory Hall was expensive at €10 million, close to €2 million of that was spent on emergency accommodation for residents while the work was being carried out. The sooner Dublin City Council decides to fund those remedial works in Longboat Quay, the less, if anything, will be spent on emergency accommodation for residents. We propose the establishment of a national building inspectorate, as opposed to the continuation of the assigned certifier system, which would examine at least 40% of the buildings under construction, and a system of licensing or registration for builders. Information on builders should be shared among the relevant authorities, with full prosecution of any designers or contractors who are negligent in their duties. A building inspectorate, much like the NCT system, with dedicated specialist staff and standardised systems, monitored by local authorities, would be more cost-effective, easier to quality control, and, ultimately, safer, than the assigned certifier system we have retained under the new regime as initiated in March 2014. We debated the supply issue in this House previously. We hope to do so again in the very near future in order that we might address the deficiencies we perceive in the Government's policy on this. I call on the Minister of State to use his influence to facilitate such a debate, so that I and other Members can be afforded the opportunity to put forward meaningful presentations and costed, constructive suggestions, which might meet the immediacy of the crisis in Dublin and beyond. For the purpose of the Second Stage debate on the Bill before the House, we support the Government's intention to dissolve the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and for its functions to be transferred to Dublin City Council. There are pressing issues for which there is great responsibility and we would use this forum to ensure that the immediate issues regarding Longboat Quay are addressed properly and effectively. I heard the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Taoiseach, when discussing the housing crisis in recent months, saying that there is no issue in respect of funding to meet the demands of reinstating homes and local authority dwellings. While I have contradicted that at times, I acknowledge the good intentions and the good faith of the Government in this regard and I hope the same good faith and intention can be impressed upon Dublin City Council to make the funds available immediately to address this issue. Agreement can be reached thereafter in respect of the residents, the DDDA - the powers of which are being subsumed by Dublin City Council - and the funds recouped from the receiver, who has a responsibility to the taxpayer on foot of the failure in the regulation of the system in such a way as to cause this unfortunate problem. For the purpose of progressing the Bill, we support it in its current form and will discuss on later Stages the various impacts it will have. We will scrutinise its contents to ensure that the dissolution is fair and appropriate, that the responsibilities of Dublin City Council are properly met and that the intentions in respect of the docklands area are retained in the planning provision it contains in order to ensure that the development will continue in a way that will drive development elsewhere in the city.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	397	The Minister of State was very polite - I use that word advisedly - in his description of the whys and wherefores of the demise of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. In 2010, Sinn Féin welcomed the investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the DDDA on the grounds that it had presided over dodgy deals and developments. Indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in February 2012 found evidence of serious mismanagement, very poor governance and what I would regard as malpractice within that authority, and recommended that the assets of the DDDA be disposed of. On 31 May 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced the Government's intention to dissolve the authority, giving its reasons for dissolution, as the Minister has this evening, as the precarious financial outlook and the latest Comptroller and Auditor General's report. It is important to record the scale of the calamity that befell the DDDA. The Minister attributes it in the main to external factors - and there is no question that these played a part - but there is much more to the story than that. The gross mismanagement and bad practice that occurred within that authority should not be glossed over in this Chamber. In February 2014, the public accounts committee concluded that €185 million of public money had been lost from seven property deals. CHQ, a shopping centre in the IFSC, had been bought by the DDDA for €45 million and sold for just €10 million. Other sites on the North Lotts Road were bought for €50 million and ended up with a value of just €7.8 million. Sites in the docklands bought using compulsory purchase orders were later transferred to NAMA at a fraction of their initial valuations. That is the legacy and that was the driving rationale, in the final analysis, for the wind-down of the authority. We support that approach. In fact, when the detail and the scale of the debacle, particularly around the Irish Glass Bottle site, came into public view, the Government was left with little option but to wind down the DDDA. I note that the Government made heavy play not just on the transfer of assets and liabilities, including superannuation, all of which might be regarded as technical necessities in the process of moving to Dublin City Council but it also made a number of remarks about the planning process. I would like to come back to that, perhaps not this evening, but tomorrow, when I have my time. For this evening, I am glad that in his opening comments, the Minister paid hearty tribute to the local community of the docklands, both northside and southside. He has set out quite correctly the very rich heritage of the docklands, their deep contribution to the life of this city, but also beyond this city, and the cultural legacy that they carry.

At the core of the Private Members' business tonight and tomorrow night is equality and looking at how the lack of accountable and transparent tax systems create inequality and exacerbate existing inequality. We have a lot of statistics that show that inequality, both in Ireland and globally, is growing. One staggering statistic is that on current trends the richest 1% in the world will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by next year. Equally staggering is the fact that since the financial crisis began, the number of billionaires worldwide has more than doubled. Economic inequality compounds the other inequalities in education and in health. As we cannot discuss and bring about climate change without a commitment to climate justice, we also cannot bring an end to inequality unless we address tax justice. There are many examples of tax injustice where millions, and in some cases billions, of euro have been lost to countries by the lack of transparency, accountability and good governance, and some of those examples are specifically mentioned in the motion. I refer, for instance, to the LuxLeaks scandal, the sweetheart deals negotiated between the tax administration and multinational corporations, in which companies are frequently represented by one of the four big accounting firms. In early 2015, the Unhappy Meal report showed how McDonald's is using the so-called innovation box in Luxembourg to lower its tax payments. Recently the US Internal Revenue Service challenged the tax arrangements of Coca-Cola, concluding the company owes $3.3 billion in extra tax. Coca-Cola is not accepting this responsibility and the company is expected to challenge this in the US tax court. A report in 2014 showed that although Barclays bank had 14 employees in Luxembourg, it generated £1.4 billion of profits - £100 million per employee. Of course, the whistleblower of the LuxLeaks scandal and the journalist who broke the story face several years in jail. When it comes to tax, we can look at Ireland's tax scandal also. Ostensibly, the corporate tax rate is 12.5% but we know that is not the reality. For example, accounts filed by companies owned by Cerberus in the Republic show that it paid €10,320 in tax on a combined turnover of €224 million in 2013 and 2014. The reality is that the big multinationals have played countries off against each other for years to ensure they keep low the tax they pay. It is staggering that Apple's annual revenues are approximately 80% of Ireland's GDP, and we are not too sure what else will emerge about Apple. The Government tells us that Ireland is not a tax haven, but we have doubts about that. One journalist stated that the small corner shop in Ireland probably will continue to pay more of its profits in tax than many of the big business. It is opportune that we are discuss this topic this week in view of the upcoming budget and the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, report published yesterday. Country-by-country reporting is vital for tax transparency in order that all the multinationals report sales, profits and taxes paid in all jurisdictions in their audited annual reports and tax returns, and these financial reports must be publicly available. Then and only then, if publicly available, will the information be available which would contribute to ending corruption. The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of this information being available publicly. Where is Ireland on that? Allied to that is the automatic exchange of information between tax jurisdictions. I have one question for the Minister which I also asked of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Why did Ireland not support the call for the intergovernmental body on tax under the United Nations, as was called for by NGOs before the financing for development conference in Addis Ababa? The result of tax avoidance, tax evasion, tax dodging and creative accounting is millions and billions of euro being lost to countries, and we are complicit in that. We think of how much our country is also losing. We think of how many of our problems in health, education and housing could be addressed if we had a fair, just, accountable and transparent tax system.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	399	The issue of corporate tax avoidance, aggressive tax planning or, to put it in more accurate language, wholesale tax evasion by the biggest, wealthiest and most profitable multinationals is the most urgent issue that needs to be addressed in the global economy and for the sake of humanity. The failure of these corporations to pay a fair and reasonable amount of their profits back into society to fund the infrastructure, services and incomes of ordinary citizens through taxation has run alongside and is directly connected to a staggering growth in inequality and an increase in the gap between rich and poor. One cannot separate these two matters. When Oxfam produces a report stating that next year the wealthiest 1% of individuals in the world will have the same amount of wealth and assets as the other 99% of society, that is a stunning, staggering, and hard to comprehend indictment of our economic system. One of the facts with which people are probably familiar is that the 180 richest individuals have more wealth personally than the 48 poorest countries in the world and there is a direct overlap between the wealth of those individuals and the corporations of which they are CEOs. Many of these corporations that are responsible for this incomprehensible concentration of wealth in a few hands are based here and that also is not a coincidence. I and most of the world are convinced, despite Government denials, that Ireland is at the centre of an international nexus of tax avoidance and tax evasion, the result of which has been a truly stunning concentration of wealth in the hands of these corporations and those who own them at the expense of society in general, in particular the less well-off. The global growth in inequality of wealth is clearly echoed in the figures in a previous motion which we discussed a few months ago and some of which are referred to in the motion under discussion. The estimates we include are the conservative estimates produced by TASC which suggest that the wealthiest 10% of the population in this country has 42% of the wealth, while Credit Suisse estimates that 10% has 58% of the wealth. Whichever is correct, it is shocking inequality. At the same time, poverty and deprivation have increased dramatically such that 750,000 people in this country live in poverty, including 250,000 children. We have the worst housing crisis in the modern history of the State. I have just come from the Department of Finance pre-budget briefing which was very interesting, but it bears out the same picture. Corporate profits have shot through the roof yet again in recent months.The increases have been stunning. When we asked the Department of Finance officials if they could explain the enormous jump in corporate tax revenue recorded for the past six months, they could not explain it. It represents a 20% increase in profits, overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of these same multinationals. This is happening at the same time as a chronic lack of investment in public housing and, as a result, homelessness levels going through the roof. We desperately need investment in all sorts of areas of infrastructure and schools. Our water infrastructure is in a state of collapse. Our hospitals have been gutted of money and investment to the tune of billions of euro and our health services are in a state of emergency. This is happening at the same time as corporate profits have gone through the roof, and there is no explanation. While it is utterly unjust, it is also the explanation for the fragility, vulnerability and crisis-prone nature of the global economy. Although Thomas Piketty and others have pointed this out, it does not seem to be taken on board by the political elites in Europe, the economists, departments of finance or the ECB. They do not seem to comprehend that this level of concentration of wealth is not just unfair but very dangerous. It is a recipe for another crash. I saw a shocking graph which showed the reduction in lending by banks to the European periphery countries, including Ireland, Greece and Portugal, all of which have been in reverse since 2008. At exactly the same time, lending to China had increased in the same proportions. There has been a massive reduction in bank lending to Europe, which is at the back of the economic collapse and the austerity that follows, while all the speculative money moves to China. How can it happen? It has created a bubble in China, where massive capacity has been built up. However, there is nobody to buy the goods given that everybody else has been hammered with austerity and eventually somebody will realise it is unsustainable, the money will run out of China, the Chinese economy will collapse and further ramifications will hit the entire global economy. Such crazy fluctuations can happen only because of the incredible concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny number of corporate and financial bodies which are accumulating massive profits and exponential profit growth. These groups, accountable to nobody and paying no tax, can create a bubble for a while in an economy and bring it crashing down just as quickly. This is not just about disgusting inequality and unfairness, whereby people are hammered with tax, austerity and cuts while profits increase and the corporations pay nothing into the infrastructure that sustains them as well as the whole of society. It also creates the crisis-prone character of the entire global economy, which is an accident waiting to happen. While there is a consensus that we must do something about it, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who has been pushed into it because everybody is screaming about Ireland’s central role in it, says we must not go too far. He is quoted on the front of The Irish Times saying we should not go too far. The base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project is just a set of guidelines; it is not binding; we are not required to do it. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is already saying we should not go too far with any of it and denying what successive Governments have done to facilitate this or turn a blind eye. At our press conference earlier I made a point that I want people to take on board regarding the technical paper produced by the Department of Finance on effective corporate tax rates, about which there is much dispute. While the US says our effective corporate tax rate is 2%, EUROSTAT says it is 6% and the Government says it is 10.9%. While one can mess around with figures, accounting and different calculation methods to obscure the reality, the truth is in the tables produced by the Revenue and published by the Department of Finance. Only last week, when we were preparing the motion, I discovered something that tells the whole story. I cannot believe the Government or Revenue did not notice it and say there was something wrong. I refer to the deductions which allow multinational corporations, primarily, to reduce their taxable profits. Corporate profits are increasing overall. In 2006, gross trading profits were €72 billion while in 2011 they had increased slightly to €73 billion. They have probably increased a little by now; these are the latest available figures. Why do we not have corporate tax figures for after 2011? Why is there a four or five year lag? In itself, this means there is no transparency. In 2006, the total income, given that there were some allowances, was €59 billion and the deductions were €5 billion. In 2011, the total income was €61 billion, but the deductions had increased to €21 billion. The deductions are mostly related to trade charges, whereby one subsidiary of a multinational charges another subsidiary royalties for the use of patents. One part of the company is taxable here while the other is not, but pays tax in the Cayman Islands or somewhere similar. Such trade charges increased from 10% of total profits in 2006 to 33% in 2011. In other words, the multinationals are saying that whatever they do to increase their profits, they will increase the price they pay to themselves to get the profits off the books of the company that is taxable in Ireland and onto the books of a subsidiary of the company that is not taxable in Ireland. They do it completely arbitrarily. I cannot believe the Government or Revenue does not look at the figures and say, “Jesus! How did that happen?” How can their deductions treble within a couple of years without anybody saying that something fishy or some sharp accounting practice is going on? Either it is gross incompetence or we turned a blind eye because we knew exactly what was going on and we decided to do nothing about it. None of it brings us to the question of the 12.5%. It is just about enforcing the 12.5% and ensuring the multinationals are not taking the taxpayer, the tax system and Irish society for a ride by playing around with sharp accounting practice in order to write down their taxable profit. At stake are billions of euro that could have gone into housing, infrastructure and health, and we have done nothing about it. When the European Commission finally screamed "foul" and said we had special deals with companies such as Apple, the Government tooled up with lawyers to fight to ensure we did not get some of the money back.

Why does it not say we will take the money back, the billions of euro in tax these guys have managed to evade by way of sharp accounting practice? Our society and economy are paying a terrible price for it and it must stop. However, there is no will to do it.The comments of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, as reported on the front of today's The Irish Times, suggest that although he understands he has to say he wants to see something done about this, he does not want to go too far. The mantra of this Government is that tax competition is a good thing. The tax specialist Richard Murphy, who has done more than any other individual to expose this practice on an international level, told us at a briefing last week that there is no such thing as good tax competition because the taxpayer, the society and the economy always lose when there is a race to the bottom in terms of corporate tax competition. There might be a short-term gain, but the long-term effect is staggering levels of inequality and the concentration of profits and wealth in the hands of multinationals that essentially hold whole Governments and economies hostage. Just as the multinationals have an aggressive policy of avoiding tax, we must have an aggressive policy of making them pay their taxes, which is something they have not been doing in recent times.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	402	I am very pleased to participate in this evening's debate, which is timely following yesterday's release of the OECD report and next week's budget announcement. This debate is about tax justice. It is about inequality and where that inequality is, and whether that can change so that multinationals pay their fair share of tax rather than trying to hide their tax affairs under bushels throughout the world. I would like to begin by making a point that has to be acknowledged as part of this debate. There must be an acceptance that the so-called aggressive taxation policy of the multinational corporations is possible because it is facilitated by states, governments and tax regimes. There is no disputing that Ireland has played and is playing a role in such facilitation. The Government's official policy of tax competition to draw in foreign direct investment means there is an official policy of facilitating the aggressive taxation policies of multinationals. There can be no equivocation on that. Nobody should be under any illusions regarding what is actually meant by the aggressive taxation policies of multinational corporations. It means evading tax. The best example of the role Ireland has played as a facilitator of this tax avoidance and evasion is the famous double Irish arrangement, which is being phased out following an international hue and cry from worldwide charities and non-governmental organisations and from public opinion. A famous Irish band is unable to play concerts without seeing protest cards being raised highlighting its tax affairs and where they are going. Significant public pressure has come on world opinion in this regard. The aggressive use of the double Irish arrangement by large multinationals has enabled them to pay little or no tax on sizeable profits. I will give some examples because such a statement should not be left hanging in thin air. Apple has three companies registered in Ireland. One of these companies, Apple Operations International, managed to channel $30 billion without making a single tax return. In 2011, Google made $12.4 billion in profit and paid just $22 million in tax. Google Ireland is owned by Google Ireland Holdings, which is in turn owned by Motorola Mobility International, which operates from a post office box in Bermuda. This nameplate company bills Google Ireland for certain costs in areas like administration, staff, sales and marketing and royalties. After all of this magic has been performed, the tax bill has more or less disappeared. It has gone. One could not make up the manner in which they are able to do this. I will mention another leading American multinational that is based in Ireland. Intel Ireland is a branch of the Intel International corporation, which is based in the Cayman Islands. I have no doubt that these companies will use and abuse the proposed knowledge development box to continue to reduce the taxes on their profits. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has made it clear that the proposed knowledge development box will be a key part of Ireland's continuing competitive advantage in attracting foreign direct investment from foreign multinationals. It has already been hinted by sources in the Department of Finance that the corporation profit tax rate for the knowledge development box will be set at 5%. This is the same rate set by those other European tax havens, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. It seems that the Government is intent on maintaining good company in this area. Today, I read the submission of the US Chamber of Commerce in Ireland to the consultation process that the Department of Finance has conducted with business interests, including those well-known tax evasion experts, KPMG. The US chamber is certainly not hiding its light behind a bushel in protecting the interests of US multinationals in Ireland. It wants the knowledge development box to have the broadest possible definition of "intellectual property". When one reads its submission, it seems that everything and anything - any sort of activity - should qualify under the rules of the knowledge development box. For example, the US chamber is saying that intellectual property should not be limited to intellectual property that is just patented. The chamber believes that any intellectual property which can be legally protected should also qualify. According to the US Chamber of Commerce, intellectual property does not actually have to be legally protected; it is just that it simply "can be". It wants a form of research and development that takes place outside Ireland but has so-called "strategic oversight" in Ireland. In its view, a company should not be required to legally own the intellectual property; it should simply have the right to use it. It is just incredible that it is looking for such a Pandora's box for the multinationals. We can see from this the myriad ways in which multinational corporations will try to exploit the knowledge development box. This avoidance and evasion of taxation is a significant contributory factor in global equality and the persistence of poverty on a global scale. It affects poorer countries in particular by denying them the tax income that could be used to provide basic health services, or to give every child the right to a basic education. It is important to state on the record of the Dáil that 13% of children in developing countries have never attended school. The majority of the children in question are young girls. This approach to tax denies developing countries the ability to deal with the 500 million children - one in every three - who do not have access to sanitation and the 400 million children who do not have access to safe water. These two problems - the lack of sanitation and safe water - cause 4,000 children to die every day. This is what such criminal activity we are discussing leads to in reality. It might be legal, but to my mind it is criminal and this Government is up to its neck in it. People are dying in developing countries. It is clear from the figures that the wealthiest 10% of the population in Ireland own 42.3% of the wealth. In the meantime, the housing crisis is the biggest humanitarian crisis to happen in this countries for decades. We have a major crisis in our health service. Approximately 1,500 children in 700 families are living in emergency accommodation. We have substantial poverty and deprivation rates in this country. Why is that happening? Is the transfer of wealth going in one direction while the bottom 50% of people are losing the means to live? That is what this debate is all about. I wish to make a final important point. I want to hear the Government's position on this loud and clear. I suggest that country-by-country reporting will not make a difference unless the information is put into the public domain. The belated actions of the OECD, the European Parliament and the EU Commission are happening solely because of public outrage. We need public reporting to keep up the pressure on Governments, the EU and the OECD and to make multinationals aware that their activities in this area will no longer take place behind closed doors and can affect their brands and their profits. It is not good enough to keep this information exclusively in Revenue, in Departments or in national authorities.Such public pressure is the only thing that will be effective in reining in this criminal activity. The Irish Government should be leading the campaign for transparency, not restricting it.

This is a very timely subject ahead of budget 2016 next week and alongside the OECD's BEPS report, which was published recently. It also falls alongside the EU proposal for automatic exchange of tax rulings, all of which represents the biggest change in the global taxation system in 100 years. Will this delayed reaction be enough to tackle the trend of increasing economic inequality both at home and abroad? At home, we have a love affair with multinational companies, the main agent in global taxation practice and tax avoidance. We provide tax incentives and supports for research and development and send our foreign direct investment missionaries to seek and find potential investors, paying for their journey to Ireland in the hope that they stay long enough to be noticed. Deals were made between Apple and the Revenue Commissioners back as far as the 1980s, effectively representing State aid for the multinational giant. Then we have the competitive corporation tax mantra, which the Government barely enforces, yet wears like a badge of honour and national pride. Of course, that means that companies do not end up paying most of the tax owed, if any at all. Tax avoidance in Ireland amounts to about €4 billion in lost tax revenue. I can think of many social needs exacerbated by the crisis which could make good use of that money, but no, we must do anything to keep the multinationals here, even losing our sovereignty for the sake of the jobs they provide. Let us look at those jobs. Zero-hour or low-hour contracts and precarious work are all features of the Government's desperate job creation policy, which looks to multinationals as a quick fix for the unemployment crisis. Multinationals have been given a central role in the economic recovery. They have even stayed relatively secure during the recession, and this year IDA Ireland promoted the central position of multinationals in job creation with an announcement on the potential creation of 80,000 jobs. Today multinationals represent 12% of total private sector employment. What about our indigenous companies? Why are they not central to our jobs policy?

Ireland is now facing growing economic inequality, with the wealthiest 20% owning around 70% of the country's total wealth, while the least well off 40% of Irish households have an almost 0% share in Ireland's wealth. The gap between rich and poor is increasing almost to US levels. There are undoubted links between tax avoidance carried out by multinationals and increasing economic inequality. The Government is very slow to react to the inherent inequalities in our taxation system, and reform is only just about on the horizon. The "double Irish" taxation mechanism was targeted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in last year's budget but it will not end until 2020 or beyond. If we are serious about income inequality and rising levels of poverty in Ireland, we need to think about implementing a fairer taxation system, under which those who can pay must pay. Apart from enforcing the corporation tax on multinationals, there must be other changes in our taxation policy.  Our tax code currently has the interests of the elite at heart. The distribution of wealth rarely strays further than a select few individuals who are protected by their tight networks and their access to large amounts of capital and assets. One idea that was floated recently was a financial transactions tax, which this Government was completely against, citing its competitive corporation tax mantra once again. The past two decades have witnessed the elimination of taxes on financial transactions in numerous countries, resulting in less control over the financial sector. Despite promises by governments since 2008, there has been very little reform of the financial sector, even though it was central to the economic crash. A financial transactions tax would be progressive in that it would target the financial services sector that is currently exempt from VAT.  Do we really have a progressive tax system? A tax system can mean more than just corporate or wealth tax. It can include taxes on capital and income as well as value added and other forms of taxation. VAT is inherently unequal because taxes on consumption are disproportionately paid by people on low incomes who have to spend all of their money. Almost all of the tax paid by the bottom 30% of households is in the form of indirect taxes. Tax avoidance extends into the international arena. In the EU there are moves towards greater transparency in tax policy, but it remains to be seen whether this will have any impact at all or whether it will be enforced. EU finance Ministers will be meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday and are expected to reach political agreement on the automatic exchange of tax rulings, a proposal launched by the European Commission this year in the wake of the Lux Leaks scandal. The proposal is to oblige states to share details of their tax rulings - essentially letters of comfort offered to companies by tax authorities - with other member states as part of a broader move towards greater corporate tax transparency across the EU. The re-launch of the common consolidated corporate tax base, which would harmonise the way taxes are calculated across the EU, was also announced in June. However, there are concerns that this could disadvantage Ireland due to the size of our economy.  Globally, it is estimated that tax avoidance costs governments between $100 billion and $400 billion in lost revenue. In fact, we do not even know how much we are losing out to these practices. While it can be argued that the recent OECD report is a step towards greater transparency in global taxation practices, the report has some shortfalls and is not nearly as aggressive as the multinationals are in their tax avoidance practices. The OECD report presents a package that does not legislate for companies to pay tax where they do real business or to stop the use of tax havens. It is effectively a code of practice as opposed to a real initiative which seeks to legislate for more equitable tax systems.  One step that we could take if we wanted to address inequality in our society is to make 12.5% the effective tax rate for corporations. We could ask the multinationals to pay the tax rate that supposedly attracted them to this country in the first place - that is, 12.5% - and make that an effective rate on their bookable profits from the very start. That would provide very useful revenue for this State to help to address the inequalities right across the State and to enable us to undo the damage that has been done throughout the crisis. In doing that, we would not have to increase the corporation tax rate by even 1%. We could just make the corporations pay the rate they claim attracted them to the country in the first place. Was that it, or was the real attraction knowing that they could use all of their tax avoidance measures without being pursued by the State in order to reduce their corporation tax bills even further? That is a question that must be asked. Yesterday I had a conversation with a constituent about the issue of income inequality across our society. That individual, who must have been a Fine Gael voter, argued that we must reward risk takers and entrepreneurs and that everybody benefits from that. However, the reality is that everybody does not benefit. The rising tide certainly does not lift all boats. If we have learned anything from the crash and the boom before it, it is that. Income inequality continued to rise and poverty continued to grow. Even if we were going to develop policies to reward risk takers, those risk takers would not be multinationals. The multinationals that come to Ireland are not taking risks by coming here. The multinationals that come here are already internationally established companies who come here to maximise profits. They do not come here to take risks on new products or to risk their entire businesses by investing and creating jobs. They come here because they know they can manipulate the tax system and get away with not even paying 12.5% in tax. If we want to talk about rewarding risk takers, we should look at our own indigenous Irish companies that are trying to compete against the global multinationals. They are taking risks but they are the ones that end up paying the 12.5%. They are not the ones who can use the system and manipulate the code to reduce their tax bills. If we want to reward those people, that is fair enough. Let us target those who are not taking risks, the companies and corporations that are not risking anything by coming here, and make sure that they contribute to our society for the benefit of all of our people. One thing is certain - the rising tide of multinationals will not lift too many boats in this country.

I look to forward to this debate because legitimate issues arise regarding aggressive tax planning as the Government and country recognise. Unfortunately, these legitimate issues tend to get lost in hyperbole and we must be careful to ensure that does not occur. We should also remember the value of attracting foreign direct investment, not only to Dublin where many of the multinational giants are located but to all of our constituencies and counties. International financial services, one of the sectors for which I have responsibility, directly employs 35,000 people, of whom 12,000 are employed outside the greater Dublin region. Many of these jobs are in County Donegal, which is obviously doing something well in terms of having an attractive workforce that attracts companies to the country. Let us not ignore the reality that a large number of talented young Irish people are pursuing well-paid careers in a number of multinational companies.  The Minister has done more to reform the tax system and to implement a road map for tax competitiveness than any of his predecessors in recent years. He launched the road map for tax competitiveness last year and abolished the double Irish, as it became known. Despite opposition to its abolition from the Fianna Fáil Party, which called on him to await the outcome of the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting or BEPS process, the Minister decided to plough ahead. He also abolished stateless companies and the Department has been an active participant in the BEPS process at a political and official level. I acknowledge the great work done by our officials in that regard.  The international tax agenda has risen to the top of the agenda around the world. Achieving a fair international tax system is now correctly recognised as a global priority. While the Government agrees that many of the issues raised in the Opposition motion are important, we do not agree with the characterisation of the Irish corporation tax system. The amendment proposed by the Government sets the record straight in terms of the transparency and robustness of the Irish system, while giving due recognition to the important changes that have taken place in recent times and the further challenges that lie ahead and need to be addressed.  Yesterday, the OECD published its final base erosion and profit shifting reports. The BEPS reports are the culmination of more than two years of intensive consultation and negotiation involving OECD, the G20 and non-OECD countries. Ireland welcomes the publication of the reports and will now play an active part in the work to implement the recommendations globally. From the very beginning of this project Ireland has been a strong supporter of the OECD's work. Let us stop the nonsense of pretending we were dragged into the process kicking and screaming. Ireland has been a leader in this regard and we believe a multilateral response, such as that provided by the OECD, represents the best solution for dealing with aggressive tax planning. In 2013, the Government published Ireland's international tax strategy. This policy statement set out Ireland's approach for dealing with international tax policy issues such as aggressive tax planning. This statement included Ireland's international tax charter, which outlines Ireland's policy objectives and commitments on international tax issues. As I indicated, we published our road map for tax competitiveness last year. This has helped to place Ireland in a very strong position for the post-BEPS world. Ireland has also introduced changes to its corporate tax residence rules in recent years to ensure they keep pace with international best practice. The Government amendment highlights Ireland's commitment to dealing with these global problems.
The key aim of the OECD BEPS project has been to align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity. As such, the project is one which aligns with Ireland's tax strategy. We want companies to locate here and bring investment and jobs. Why else would we want companies to come here if not to deliver jobs, investment and euro to the economy? Jobs and investment are the cornerstones of our foreign direct investment policy, which precisely aligns with the entire purpose of the OECD BEPS process. From an Irish perspective, consistent international action to tackle aggressive tax planning is far preferable to countries doing their own thing and taking unilateral action. The BEPS reports are comprehensive and the key outcome of the measures contained in the final reports is to give countries the tools they need to ensure profits are taxed where economic activities generating the profits are performed and value is created. In addition, the reports will give business greater certainty by reducing disputes over the application of international tax rules. The BEPS reports do not affect Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate. The OECD has explicitly stated that taxation is at the core of countries' sovereignty and each country is free to set up its corporate tax system as it chooses, including charging the rate it chooses. The 12.5% corporation tax rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery and employment growth and a low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to core countries. Deputies need not take my word for that and can instead read the ESRI report published on budget day last year.  Focus will now shift to the implementation of the BEPS reports. Ireland is committed to the BEPS project and we will play a full part in its implementation. Our commitment to the BEPS project and tackling aggressive tax planning has been noted by the OECD Secretary General who recently cited Ireland as "a strong and exemplary case of adapting and adopting" to reform of the global tax regime. As a number of Deputies noted, the most immediate action emerging from the BEPS process for Ireland will be the introduction of country by country reporting in line with the BEPS recommendations. As the Minister stated yesterday in Brussels, country by country reporting will be legislated for in this year's finance Bill, which will follow the budget next week. It is our intention to implement this proposal in a way that is absolutely consistent with the recommendations of the OECD. This will introduce a requirement for large multinationals to file reports of income, taxes paid and certain measures of economic activity on a country by country basis. The report is to be filed with the tax authority where the group parent is tax resident and then shared with other tax authorities. The reports provide a valuable risk assessment tool for tax authorities. Country by country reporting has been described by some commentators as a "game changer" in tackling aggressive tax planning. On launching the BEPS reports yesterday, the OECD highlighted Ireland as one of the first countries to commit to implementing country by country reporting. Ireland's 2013 international tax strategy statement flagged our support for country by country reporting. Our early commitment to implement the OECD's recommendations is consistent with our long-standing policy of supporting increased openness and transparency in tax matters. The motion asks that the information in country by country reports be made publicly available. The OECD is very clear on this point - to protect the confidentiality of potentially sensitive information the reports must not be made publically available. If a country breaches this confidentiality requirement, partner countries may suspend the exchange of information. This must be about global solutions.  It is important to note, however, that the European Commission is separately examining the issue of public country by country reporting. This would require companies to make information publicly available about its operations, activities and profits in each country in which it operates. The Commission recently held a public consultation on the issue and has commissioned an impact assessment. Ireland awaits the outcome of this assessment and will continue to actively engage in the debate on this issue at European Union level. The second immediate outcome of the BEPS report, one which has also been noted by previous speakers, is the proposed knowledge development box. The box will be designed in full compliance with the OECD's proposals for such measures and the Minister has signalled his intention to introduce such a box in budget 2016. The knowledge development box will enhance the competitiveness of the Irish tax offering for intellectual property and ensure Ireland continues to be the location of choice for foreign direct investment that involves real employment and economic activity. It will provide a rate of tax for intellectual property income that is below the normal headline rate to encourage companies to locate high-value jobs that are associated with the development of intellectual property in Ireland. The Government has committed that the knowledge development box will meet the standards agreed internationally for such incentives, which have been agreed as part of the BEPS process and endorsed by the European Union. It is important to note from a competitiveness, promotional and reputational point of view that the knowledge development box will be the first and only such box in the world that complies with the OECD's new standards. The legislation to enact the box is being finalised and will be included in the Finance Bill 2015. The other key BEPS recommendations will be implemented either through a multilateral instrument which will be negotiated during 2016 or through changes to the OECD's transfer pricing guidelines. The multilateral instrument will seek to update global tax treaties in one go to ensure they meet the new global standards set out in the BEPS reports. The OECD's transfer pricing guidelines will be updated to ensure profits are properly aligned with the value created through underlying economic activities. As Deputies will be aware, the European Union is also debating how BEPS recommendations can be implemented at EU level. The European Commission published a detailed action plan on corporate taxation in June, which contains a number of proposals, including an anti-BEPS directive and the relaunch of the common consolidated corporate tax base proposal. On the proposed anti-BEPS directive, Ireland supports the consistent implementation of BEPS recommendations across the European Union. A co-ordinated EU approach to implementing BEPS could ensure legal certainty and coherence in the Single Market and a strong common defence against profit-shifting out of the EU. However, as the Minister made clear yesterday, Ireland believes it is important that any anti-BEPS directive is consistent with the OECD BEPS reports and does not go beyond them. As set out in the Government amendment, Ireland has been a leader internationally in the area of tax transparency. This morning in Brussels, European finance Ministers reached political agreement on the amendment to the directive on administrative co-operation, also known as DAC 3 as the directive is in its third iteration. When transposed, this directive will provide for the automatic exchange of information on rulings throughout the EU. This directive was a direct EU response to the scandal known as LuxLeaks. Ireland has been fully supportive of the proposal from the beginning and we welcome today's agreement. The domestic Irish response to the LuxLeaks revelations was that the Revenue Commissioners decided to look at the material relating to Irish based entities and make inquiries to see if they could ascertain whether the Irish tax system was being abused in any fashion. I understand the Revenue Commissioners propose to write to the Department of Finance to provide it with a high level outline of the outcome of their inquiries, with a particular emphasis on highlighting any tax policy issues for Ireland that might be identified. In relation to the issue of a register of beneficial ownership, the EU is also currently looking at proposals in this area. Article 30 of the recently published fourth anti-money laundering directive provides that information on beneficial owners of corporate and other legal entities must be held in a central register and accessible by certain persons. The Department of Finance is considering this article in the course of the transposition of the directive in conjunction with other Departments. A public consultation on the transposition of the directive will be held in the coming months and it is due to be transposed into Irish law by June 2017. I turn to the ongoing state aid investigation being pursued by the European Commission and which has wrongly been referenced by some Deputies in the House this evening. Before I update the House on this matter, I reject completely the suggestion in the Private Members' motion that the investigation reveals a lack of transparency or accountability from the Revenue Commissioners to the Irish people. That is completely inaccurate. Ireland's Revenue Commissioners are statutorily independent and carry out their duties with the highest levels of integrity. If we impugn them in any way in that regard, it does not serve us well. Last year, the competition directorate of the European Commission announced its intention to open formal state aid investigations into tax rulings provided to a number of companies in various EU countries. The announcement is part of a much wider review of tax ruling practices being undertaken by the European Commission. Earlier this year, the Commission announced that it was broadening its inquiries to include all member states. As the Commission has noted, Ireland has co-operated fully with the process to date and we will continue to do so. I emphasise that while the Commission has opened a formal investigation in relation to one particular case involving Ireland, it has not made a final determination in the matter no matter how many times people repeat assertions to the contrary. Ireland provided a detailed and comprehensive response to the Commission investigation demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no state aid. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made it clear that if there is a finding against Ireland by the Commission, we will challenge it in the European Courts. We will defend this because we are in the right. As the House is well aware, tax law in Ireland is created and enacted by the Oireachtas. There is no specific provision in Irish tax law for the issuing of binding tax rulings and such rulings are not provided under the Irish tax system. However, non-binding opinions on the application of tax law to specific transactions or situations are issued by the Revenue Commissioners. A Revenue opinion will give Revenue's view of the correct application of tax legislation to a particular transaction, activity or event. Revenue opinions are designed to provide clarity in relation to the applicable tax rules in circumstances where there might otherwise be uncertainty and to enable a taxpayer to file a correct tax return as required by legislation. Revenue practice and procedures for providing opinions are set out in published guidelines, which are available on Revenue's website. In responding to the Commission's state aid inquiries in relation to ruling practices and its request for details of advance opinions relating to corporation tax issued to companies, a total of 120 such opinions were identified on average for each of the years 2010 to 2012. This is a relatively small number in the context of the number of companies filing a tax return which we estimate is approximately 120,000. It shows that opinions are not a major feature of the Irish tax system. This is because Revenue provides a wide range of information in published tax briefings and guidance notes. A taxpayer should only require an opinion from Revenue where the issue is complex, information is not readily available and there is uncertainty in regard to the applicable tax rules. I want to talk about engagement with developing countries. Ireland's "One World, One Future" policy for international development commits us to an all-of-Government approach to international development and recognises that the achievement of international development goals must be underpinned by the ability of all countries, including developing countries, to raise their own revenue. The OECD's BEPS process also sought to involve developing countries to ensure all viewpoints were considered. Developing countries and regional tax organisations have participated in BEPS project work and influenced the outputs of the BEPS reports. The OECD has made a welcome commitment to continue this engagement and develop practical toolkits to assist developing countries in targeting BEPS activities. On the domestic front, the Department of Finance committed in the document "Ireland's International Tax Strategy" in October 2013 to engaging with developing countries to assist them in increasing their domestic tax revenues in ways that are more efficient, fairer and which better promote good governance and equity. As part of this commitment, the Department of Finance is publishing a spillover analysis of the impact of Ireland's tax system, including the tax treaty network, on the economies of developing countries on budget day. Only one other country in the world - the Netherlands - has previously carried out a similar spillover analysis project. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, called on the OECD to adopt, at least in spirit, a 16th action in the BEPS project insisting that all countries undertake spillover analyses of how their taxation regimes impact the developing world. We reiterate our encouragement to all countries to carry out such an analysis. The actions taken in recent years by Ireland and our involvement in international fora such as the OECD and EU mean we are well positioned for the post BEPS environment. Our next challenge is to implement the BEPS actions. Ireland will play its part, as it has done to date, in implementing the recommendations and contributing to solutions to these global problems. Global problems require global solutions and the multilateral approach adopted by G20 and OECD countries in dealing with these difficult policy challenges is a model for co-operation in today's globalised economy. I acknowledge, as the motion does, the work of Oxfam. I had the opportunity, as had many Members, to meet with Oxfam in recent weeks. It is doing an excellent job of highlighting many important issues including those which will be dealt with in the BEPS process as well as issues we need to deal with at European level. I am proud of the spillover analysis we are carrying out to check the impact of our own tax system on the developing world and I look forward to its publication. I encourage other countries to follow the lead of Ireland and the Netherlands in that regard. Tonight's motion is really worthwhile in that it gives us an opportunity to have an extensive debate on a number of important issues. Nobody on this side of the House is trying to assert that everything is wonderful and that there are no challenges. It is absolutely the case that there are issues which need to be addressed in relation to aggressive tax planning and we believe the way to address them is a global process. It is through all countries sitting around a table and working out solutions rather than people taking unilateral action. We are proud to have played a leading role in that and to be involved in the first implementation of many of the actions. We look forward to progressing some of them through the Finance Bill and I look forward to the rest of the debate.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	410	Base erosion and profit-shifting is a global phenomenon that requires a global policy response. In that context, I welcome the publication yesterday of the OECD report in the matter. Indeed, I would have welcomed a debate on the issue tonight, but it is clear from the content of the contributions made by the proponents of the motion and in the motion itself that there has been a reversion to type and a debate about Ireland's corporation profits tax rate. That is not an issue being considered at all in the OECD report. We reverted to name calling of multinationals. We would do well to remember in the context of the debate that we are a small, open trading economy. We have an indigenous sector which, fortunately, is getting back on its feet and playing a role in the domestic and exporting economy, but equally a critical element of our economic recovery involves foreign direct investment. One of the things that foreign direct investors value is political and economic stability. I shudder to think of the message they would take from the proponents of the motion as to how safe and secure their investments would be were some of those proponents sitting on the front benches on this side of the House. Deputy Joan Collins would do well to remember that foreign direct investment is, above all else, highly mobile. She would do well to remember that we take in approximately €2.8 billion in tax revenue under corporation profits tax. We are a peripheral economy. We are peripheral economically and geographically and one of the tools we have to use to our advantage is our corporation profits tax rate which, fortunately, is still a national competence. It is not something that can be imposed or dictated from outside. Long may that be the case and long should the Members of the House protect our economic sovereignty in that regard rather than cede it to the OECD, EU or anybody else. We would also do well to remember that the 1,000 companies involved, some of which Deputy Collins and others name-called and some of which give very valuable employment in my constituency, include Alps, VMware, EMC, Stryker, Boston Scientific, Google, Apple and Facebook.They contribute more than 161,000 direct jobs and 274,000 indirect jobs to this economy. We would do well to remember that, per annum, they pay approximately €8 billion and account for exports of approximately €122 billion, all of which adds to the sum of economic activity. Without them, this country would be in a poorer place. The Deputies' message is that we are hostile. In a different debate, Deputy Pringle could excoriate the Minister of State over the lack of foreign direct investment, FDI, in the former's part of the constituency when, without any shred of embarrassment, he saw no contradiction with that in his diatribe tonight against FDI and Ireland's corporate tax rate. We cannot have it both ways. We need a mature debate on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, but that is a different matter from our sovereign entitlement to establish a 12.5% corporate tax rate. I accept that the effective rate is less, but some countries that have substantially higher headline rates have lower effective tax rates. We are competing for FDI. I salute IDA Ireland and the political support that facilitates it in promoting Ireland as the number one location of choice for FDI. This is down to myriad factors that we handle well, for example, our education system, tax system and political stability, and our position as an English-speaking eurozone member. We must be careful in what will be a necessary debate not to send the wrong signals to those with investments to make. Recently, I accepted an invitation from a foreign direct investor, Pfizer in Cork, which provides much employment in the pharmaceutical sector. It has some operations in the Minister of State's constituency. It made the point that, when facing significant challenges a number of years ago, it considered closing one of its plants. Companies close when they do not make profit. "Profit" is not a dirty word. Without profit, businesses close and people lose their jobs. We would do well to remember that because Deputies Joan Collins and Boyd Barrett would be the first to jump up and down if a significant foreign direct investor in their constituencies was about to leave-----

We would do well to remember this simple economic message. People on the far side of the House seem to have a difficulty grasping it. In the context of the OECD's report, I urge the Minister of State to be extremely careful as regards unilateral action and the choreographing of the requisite changes. We do not need to make martyrs of ourselves on the international altar. We need to address the issues that have been raised, but we must ensure that the choreography around minimum standards and common approaches does not disadvantage us. As with a phrase coined during the Northern Ireland peace process, we must ensure that people "jump together" at EU and OECD level on tax treaties and so on and that we are not disadvantaged by the legislation that will be necessary to underpin the report's recommendations. We have not been dragged kicking and screaming. Rather, we have been an active participant in this process. Our economy and people who gain valuable employment in the FDI sector should not be disadvantaged. We should send the signal that their employment is welcome and that we intend to protect and attract inward investment.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	415	I believe that Deputy Creed spoke to a different motion, as the one before the House is welcome, timely and positive and I thank the Deputies, particularly Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, for introducing it. I wish to address the idea of asking people to jump first. Almost €1 trillion in illicit financial flows left developing countries in 2011 for developed countries. This was facilitated by transfer mispricing, which is incorrect pricing between companies, false invoicing and hybrid mismatches of different types of tax treaty to the benefit of the developed countries versus the developing countries. This is seven times the amount of overseas development aid, ODA, that is given to developing countries every year. Let us realise that this is a serious issue. People have jumped first and are paying the price for it, those being, people in developing countries who are being starved of their own natural resources, which are travelling to developed countries. The BEPS process is positive and, if we want it to, has the ability to achieve an outcome that leads to the type of international financial architecture that produces what we need. Alternatively, the process could be restrictive, selective and mealy-mouthed to give the impression that we are doing something right. The issue was never with Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5%. The issue was with how people were able to manipulate the tax structure via our tax residency rules. For example, creative licences held in other countries could be racked up in an American tax system that did not recognise tax residency in Ireland. Anything that was earned elsewhere could be funnelled through Ireland without tax being paid on it. Tax was paid on anything earned in Ireland, so our rate was not the issue. Rather, our tax infrastructure, when interacting with another country's infrastructure, allowed for a loophole. Perhaps the criticism of us was not because of our 12.5% rate, but because we did not close the loophole even though we knew that this system was in place. The same argument could be made against the government of the other country that was a party to the system, namely, the US, which also knew that its tax code facilitated the same loophole. How we account for royalty payments, patents and intellectual property is an issue. We claim that none of the value is held in other European countries because the only aspect that matters is the intellectual property, which is held in Ireland - not the building of the iPhone, the packaging, the marketing or the selling - so no tax is due in other developed countries. If BEPS and the OECD process do not solve this basic unfairness of funnelling profits into a country like Ireland, using this system not to pay tax and putting money in offshore tax havens like Bermuda, they will not be worth the paper on which they are written. We must consider another step. As this issue affects everyone around the world, we should be considering a human rights-based approach to tax. If one wishes to vindicate people's economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, money is required. As someone once stated, we have set up the ugliest economic affairs since slavery, in that the tax system allows money to be taken out of developing countries where people are dying. Some $100 million recovered from this type of tax evasion could immunise 4 million children and save their lives. It is estimated that, between 2001 and 2015, some 5.6 million young people died because of the revenues lost due to the tax issues of transfer mispricing and false invoicing. Ireland has played a part in that. The scary aspect is that it does not need to be Ireland. Owing to the way that the system is set up, the revenue could be moved again. It is good that we are closing the double Irish, as it can be circumvented by a company being based offshore in Bermuda or in Malta where royalties or patents are not taxed. The double Irish can be fixed in the morning. The idea that we have closed it is not accurate.

The Government's amendment, which I agree with, points to many positives, but it could have acknowledged more of the effort that was invested on the Opposition benches in highlighting some of the moral outrages that matter in the world. We have a long way to go. As a nation, we will be judged on how we implement the multilateral treaty and the BEPS process. My position is that we are serious about this.It is true that Ireland was only the second country in the world to bring in a spillover analysis and has been to the fore in pushing the BEPS process and changing its tax structures. However, Ireland must have an overarching vision of what it wishes to do with its tax system. It should be based on human rights and recognising Ireland's obligations not just to itself, its people and Members' constituents and their jobs but also to the lives of people around the world who are dependent on the resources they produce and their natural resources provide.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	418	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate and thank Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Joan Collins, Boyd Barrett and their colleagues for tabling this motion. While I agree with much of what is contained in this motion, Fianna Fáil cannot support it for a number of reasons. On reading through the motion that has been tabled, there is an implicit criticism of Ireland's corporation tax rate. That is not a position Fianna Fáil can support and, equally, there are calls for Ireland to move urgently to change its corporate tax regime and that would be of concern to me. Genuine issues have been raised in this motion that require careful consideration and must be addressed. Deputy Boyd Barrett and I served on a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that examined this issue and held a series of hearings into it. I am sure we did not agree on everything but we learned a lot and the stand-out point I took from the sub-committee's analysis of the issue and from the hearings held with various interested parties was that transfer pricing plays a central role in aggressive tax planning by multinationals, particularly in the area of intellectual property rights and royalty payments. The practice that emerged and which is well documented was of profits ultimately being channelled to tax havens, and Ireland is not a tax haven, through the ownership of intellectual property in the tax haven and of that company, which invariably was a book or shelf company, charging extremely high royalty payments to other subsidiaries of the overall company abroad with the net result being the profits end up in the tax haven in which no tax in effect is charged. This was the key issue that emerged for me during the debate. One is talking about places like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands or Jersey, which are overseas dependencies or Crown territories of the United Kingdom. It is ironic that the United Kingdom is one of the G20, which is pushing for these changes, and its authorities might examine what influence they can bring to bear on many of these countries in which billions of euro in profits are ending up and where they are not subject to corporation tax. The United States of course feels especially aggrieved by this because, under its own laws, multinational profits cannot be taxed until the profits are repatriated. Consequently, the United States also has an issue in respect of its own legislation. I believe any changes to Ireland's corporate tax system must be considered carefully given the huge contribution it has made to the creation of large numbers of high-quality jobs nationwide and any changes should be based on evidence. This debate takes place against the backdrop of the news Members received today that European Union finance ministers have agreed to exchange automatically information on tax arrangements reached with multinational companies, and it remains to be seen whether the sharing of confidential communications between Revenue and multinational investors in Ireland with its EU counterparts will have a positive or negative effect on Ireland's ability to attract inward investment. Ireland historically has used its corporate tax policy in a manner designed to support multinational investment. At the end of 2014, there were 174,000 people employed in IDA-supported companies, and while not all these jobs can be attributed directly to the impact of Ireland's corporate tax regime, it remains a vital part of our offering to prospective investors alongside other features such as market access, access to skilled labour and a stable regulatory environment. The people also have been clear about how important it is to them that Ireland retains this tool for job creation and in particular on the issue of the corporation tax rate. While I acknowledge this is not the central issue in the motion tabled, a core part of the debate in every European treaty referendum held in Ireland has been a discussion about the importance of it retaining control of our corporate tax policy, with the public insisting that Ireland's corporate tax system, and the corporation tax rate in particular, is a red-line issue that cannot be compromised in any way. Ireland has made clear consistently it will not accept any attempt to force tax harmonisation on it against its will. I am sure all Members can agree a one-size-fits-all tax system would neither work for Europe nor serve it well. The question of corporation tax occasionally can become clouded in myth. One myth that often surfaces in debates such as this is that increasing the rate will lead to a pro rata increase in corporation tax revenue. Fianna Fáil does not submit to that view. All Members must bear in mind that Ireland is now competing for international investment in a highly competitive global environment and the text of this motion is built in part on the myth that corporations contribute very little to the taxes collected by the Irish State. Recent Exchequer figures show, however, that corporation tax has brought in €3.9 billion in the first nine months of the year, which is €1.2 billion more than for the same period last year. Consequently, without changing its corporation tax rate or rules in any significant way, Ireland has benefited disproportionately well from the global economic upturn. The percentage of Irish tax revenue generated from taxes on corporate profits has been almost exactly on a par with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average since 2007. From 1993 to 2006, Ireland was above the OECD average in its reliance on taxes on corporate profits, and this point is often not made when Members debate corporation tax. Most countries in the EU gather a smaller percentage of their overall tax revenues from taxing corporate profits than does Ireland. The list of those EU countries that place less of the tax burden on corporations includes large countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany, all of which are members of the G20, which is the driving force behind recent proposals to change the international approach to corporation tax. For example, Germany gathers 5% of its tax revenues from taxing corporate profits while in Ireland, that figure is far higher at approximately 9%. In comparison with GDP, taxes on corporate profits in Ireland are more than a third higher than in Germany and, in this context, one must be wary of corporation tax changes dictated by large countries of the G20. It is worth remembering that large countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and others that criticise Ireland's corporate tax regime are themselves actively cutting corporation tax and are seeking to make their tax regimes more attractive. One should not lose sight of the fact that at the heart of this international debate is an envy to some degree of Ireland's success in attracting inward investment. Many other countries covet our jobs, investment and corporation tax revenue and Members must also bear this in mind. Corporations that are drawn to Ireland, in part by its corporate tax system, also pay taxes other than corporation tax. One example is commercial rates, which are essential in funding local services. One technology company contributes almost €3 million per year in commercial rates to Dublin City Council for a cluster of buildings in the Grand Canal Dock area. In small companies, profits are taxed twice as the company pays corporation tax before issuing dividends to shareholders, who then pay income tax on them. As employers, multinational corporations pay employers' PRSI and their employees pay tax on their incomes. The model of Ireland's corporation tax system over recent decades has been focused on job creation with its corporate tax system becoming one of the main attractions of Ireland to multinational companies seeking a European base. Employment is created directly by multinational companies attracted to Ireland but also indirectly as they put huge sums of money into the Irish economy. This indirect increase in employment can be considerable. For instance, Apple employs more than 4,000 people in Cork but it also is believed to have created indirectly at least a further 2,000 to 2,500 jobs in the local area. As an aside, I must state my concern regarding the ongoing delay by the European Commission in concluding its investigation into certain tax matters between Apple and the Revenue Commissioners. This issue has been hanging there for a considerable time and is a cloud, as such, over Ireland's corporate tax regime that must be dealt with one way or another. If the European Commission believes there is an issue in this regard, it should conclude its deliberations and make that known and we will deal with it. The Minister of State has made clear that the Government, having examined the files and having taken the advice of the Revenue, does not believe that Ireland has a case to answer.It remains to be seen what will happen in that area but it needs to be brought to a conclusion. We very much support the investment by Apple, and many other companies, in Ireland. The point must also be made that these are not brass-plate operations. In the debate regarding corporation tax and multinational companies, there is often a perception that these companies are simply book companies - in other words, they erect a brass plate beside the front door but no one actually works in the building. That could not be further from the truth in the case of Ireland, which has attracted many of the world's largest multinationals in the areas of information technology, pharmaceuticals, etc. The original success of our corporate tax strategy was seen in the financial services sector, especially in the IFSC. That success has been followed by incredible growth in high-tech industries. While we all know the names of the Internet giants such as Google, Facebook and PayPal, which employ thousands of people in Ireland, we must also remember companies in other fields. For example, in the medical technology areas there is Medtronic, which has over 2,500 employees in Ireland, most of whom are based in Galway. Those seeking to bring prestigious international employers to Cork can now boast that EMC, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Amazon and Apple have chosen it as the European base of their global operations. These are real companies, not brass-plate operations, and that point should be to the fore in this debate. The examples to which I refer show how a critical mass of companies in a certain sector established in Ireland develops a world centre for that industry here, attracting other companies with similar businesses that are eager to benefit from the expertise of a highly-skilled local workforce. The spin-off businesses that are created and supported are vital to the indigenous sector as well. However, we must also be alert to the opposite effect. If some companies in a sector were forced to leave Ireland as a result of negative changes to our corporate tax system, others might also leave as Ireland's critical mass of expertise takes flight to other countries for tax reasons. That could have a profound effect on the knowledge economy clusters linked to the pharmaceutical industry and to the Internet companies located in the so-called silicon docks area of Dublin. Rather than attacking our corporate tax system, it would be preferable to focus on looking for merging sectors that could create the next opportunity for jobs growth in this country. One area we have placed considerable emphasis on is the opportunity presented to leverage Irish expertise in Internet technology, namely, e-commerce and online payments technology, on the one hand, and financial services, on the other, in order to ensure Ireland becomes a world leader in financial technology. Much focus has been placed on corporation tax systems in the international context by the OECD's publication of its recent report on base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS. This report estimates that base erosion and profit shifting can lead to a loss of between 4% and 10% of corporate tax revenues. The reforms it proposes would represent the most wide-ranging overhaul of relevant tax rules in many decades. My reaction to these proposals has been to make clear that Ireland should think very carefully before agreeing to any changes that would affect the offering we can make in terms of inward investment. Ireland punches significantly above its weight in terms of inward investment and any changes to our corporation tax system could ultimately cost jobs and reduce tax revenue to the Irish State. We must ensure that the net effect of these OECD proposals is not simply that corporation tax receipts end up migrating away from countries such as Ireland to larger economies like the G20 states, which have been driving the process. Fianna Fáil believes that the corporation tax system for multinational companies must be transparent. It must be fairly applied to all companies and it must be underpinned by strict rules against aggressive tax planning. We strongly support a 12.5% rate and we believe that certainty in our corporation tax arrangements is vital. The primary duty of the Government is to protect our national interests. It must ensure that these changes are not implemented in a manner that will place Ireland at a serious disadvantage. I am concerned by the fact that the proposals which have been put forward appear to leave much to the discretion of tax authorities in individual countries. We must be alive to the possibility that other tax authorities may not act with the same consistency and transparency as the Irish Revenue Commissioners when there is international competition for large employers. Such a lack of clarity is never helpful in taxation matters. I welcome this opportunity to re-emphasise the importance of our corporation tax system as a key driver of job creation, especially in the knowledge economy. We must be vigilant in protecting our corporation tax system from external attack, in particular by large countries, which consistently place less of a tax burden on their own corporations while still criticising our low tax employment centred approach. There is considerable scope within all of that for improving the system internationally for greater transparency and disclosure, and we very much support that. In an Irish context, I want to put some figures on the record. The total annual average corporation tax receipts in Ireland between 2008 and 2012 was in the region of €4.1 billion. The top ten companies paid 24%, or €1 billion, of that. The top 20 companies paid 32% and the top 50 companies paid almost half, namely, 46%. We need to bear that in mind. These are real operations providing much valued employment in this country and supporting indirect employment as well, and they are also paying a lot of corporation tax.

Aontaíonn Sinn Féin leis an gcuid is mó den rún seo. Last week, we heard from the CSO and the OECD that 17.5% - one in six - of Irish people are living abroad. That is a phenomenal figure and it is far worse in the 20 and 30 age group, which is one in four. That makes Ireland worse with regard to those OECD figures. We know that approximately one third of a million people have emigrated, that 250,000 here are unemployed, that 85,000 people are on activation schemes such as JobBridge and that approximately 110,000 people who are underemployed seek proper hours. Approximately 750,000 people out of a population of 4.5 million have been hit hard by this Government's policies. I spoke with an elderly man recently who has just gone blind as a result of cataracts. He is taking a blood thinning tablet, which means that if he falls and cuts himself he will bleed profusely. He has to wait two years for an operation on his eyes. Five thousand people throughout the country are homeless. People are dying, literally, on the streets for the lack of accommodation. Hundreds of thousands of others are waiting for houses or are to the pin of their collar with regard to mortgages or extremely high rents. During the recession, the wealth of the 100 richest people in the State increased by €12 billion. The richest 20% own 73% of the wealth of this State while the poorest 20% own 0.2% of the wealth. Part of the reason for that breakdown in services and in the cohesion of the State is the fundamental tax injustice that exists. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have made tax avoidance an international competitive advantage of this State and, as a result, our reputation internationally is mud. Some years ago, the Taoiseach travelled to California and the Governor of that state joked about Ireland's tax avoidance schemes. This Government has been dragged kicking and screaming every inch of the way with regard to these issues. We have seen U-turns on the double-Irish arrangement with regard to making stateless companies tax resident here. Even when it acted, there was a reluctance and a meanness of spirit. Companies will have five years to extricate themselves from the double-Irish arrangement. What other group of taxpayers would be given a five years period of grace with regard to a tax loophole being closed? Yesterday, the OECD produced the latest report on BEPS. The idea behind the OECD plan is a worthy one. In the same way that tax evasion at home should be tackled, it should be tackled on an international basis. It is obscene that we have hugely profitable companies, some with turnovers the size of countries, being allowed through accounting practices and other schemes to legally avoid paying much tax at all. We should be clear: Ireland's ability to set its corporation tax is not in question and any argument on that issue is simply a distraction and should not be given any time. What is in question is the ability of the country to fund important services, and our international reputation and in that there are serious and legitimate challenges. The BEPS plan is not perfect. It has many weaknesses and some of them have been discussed in previous debates.However, it is a good step forward and it should be actively implemented. I am gobsmacked at some of the figures I have seen today. Thus far this year we have seen an increase of 45% in corporation tax receipts. That represents over €1 billion, an unbelievably large figure. At the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform I asked the chief economist of the Department of Finance what could account for this vast increase. Suggestions were made that it could be because of increased profits or the change in exchange rates. The change in exchange rates or profits could never account for a 45% increase in the three quarters of the year. The chances are that large companies are now putting their taxation houses in order because the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, measures are coming down the road. If this is the case, and if it follows that we will have higher receipts in corporation tax amounting to hundreds of millions of euro, if not billions, then the Government's inaction in this area during the past four years has actually cost the State €4 billion. The Government has been ideologically opposed to getting these companies to pay their fair share of taxation. The results can be seen in the accident and emergency departments, emergency accommodation and classrooms in this country. This is an example of the vandalism the Government has wrought on the country.
