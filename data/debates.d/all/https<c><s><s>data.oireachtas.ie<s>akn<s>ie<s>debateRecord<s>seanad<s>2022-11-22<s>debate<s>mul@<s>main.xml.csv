I want to raise the issue of land ownership, its transparency, and the State's role and responsibility in terms of land that should fall under its control. I will talk about one particular situation, but this is something I have come across over the years. I am sure it mirrors a lot of different situations. I have been working closely with constituents on the issue of an access lane that divides two properties in Newbridge. This particular issue has brought to the fore the lack of transparency and joined up thinking when it comes to access and ownership. I want to give a very brief overview. I am talking about a lane between two homes in the same estate. It is also an access lane to an ESB facility. However, the ESB does not own the land but requires access to it. One of the two houses in question felt for whatever reason that the land fell within their boundary and have blocked access to others. Of course this was of concern to the second resident who has not looked to take the access lane into their own boundary, but just wants to have access in terms of work that needs to be carried out at the side and back of the house. They have also used this patch of ground over the years. As I am sure the Minister of State and every Member of this House has seen in their time in public office, issues such as this can cause huge tension between neighbours. There really needs to be a clarity of process. I was asked to assist in this situation and to say that I was given the runaround is the understatement of the year. I have a response from Kildare County Council stating that the laneway is not in the ownership of Kildare County Council, and it is not public. It advised the seeking of legal advice. Of course, this was not a satisfactory response and residents should not have to incur private legal fees to contact agencies relating to what is now perceived to be State land. We began to liaise with the Property Registration Authority and I thank David in my office for his help on this. It confirmed the land was registered to a private limited company, which has been dissolved. The response was that if the company was dissolved, as far as it knew, the land goes back to the State. I also went to the Oireachtas section of the Property Registration Authority and it did not seem to know what happens with such tracts of land. I continued pushing to see if we could get clarity. I submitted parliamentary questions through a colleague in the Dáil, but they were disallowed, and nobody wanted to take any form of responsibility. I contacted the ESB to see what communications it has had as it has right of access, and it has not given a straight answer either. The residents have also done further investigation and were informed that such land returns to the State through the Department of Finance. That was a similar response to that of the Property Registration Authority. I moved on to the Department of Finance, which eventually came back and more or less said it had looked into it, would not be getting involved, and did not confirm any further detail. I logged a Commencement matter for the Department of Finance and now I find it has been redirected to the OPW. I do not mind if I get an answer. We are on this case since last summer and to date we are none the wiser. I hope I can get clarity from the Minister of State today and that he will commit to arranging for a proper review of this case to be conducted by a senior official in the Department. This matter gives rise to a wider question regarding how we deal with what appear to be public lands. If it is the case that tiny parcels of land such as this fall under State control upon the dissolution of a company, the process should be clear and transparent. In addition, there should be more clearly defined rights of use and access, as well as maintenance agreements. Without clear definitions and in the absence of State agencies that actually engage, there can be no resolution to conflicts such as that in the example outlined. What is the procedure with lands such as those to which I refer? Who has ultimate responsibility? Who do residents and public representatives deal with in such matters? Will the Minister of State commit to helping to seek a solution?

I thank them for coming to Dublin. They have busy agendas. I hope they have all of the solutions in their bags. Given the fact we are 24 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, when the negotiators involved solved matters relating to decommissioning, prisoner releases and the RUC, I am sure the challenges that lie ahead are well within everyone's capacity to solve. I thank our guests for coming to Seanad Éireann.
#OssianSmyth	unknown-#OssianSmyth-party	unknown-#OssianSmyth-dob	unknown-#OssianSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	5	I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome our distinguished guests. I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising this matter, to which I will reply on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan. I will explain what the OPW does on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in this area. Section 28 of the State Property Act 1954 provides that property held by a dissolved company at the time of its dissolution becomes property of the State in the name of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It was previously in the name of the Minister for Finance but a transfer of functions order in 2011 transferred responsibility to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. A legislative exception to this property becoming vested in the Minister is where the property was held on trust for another at the time of dissolution. The legislation provides for both real and personal property and since 2005, the OPW has dealt with real property that devolves to the State. Management of personal property rests with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Since the early 1990s, the number of companies incorporated has risen significantly from approximately 8,000 per annum in the 1980s to more than 18,000 per annum from 2010 to 2019. There has also been a corresponding increase in the number of companies dissolved where the average number of companies dissolved in the decade 2010-19 was more than 13,000 per year. Only a small proportion of dissolved companies hold real property. There is no register of properties held by dissolved companies at the time of their dissolution. The OPW only becomes aware of property that has devolved to the State when an issue needs to be resolved. Another important legislative provision to note is that companies can be restored to the register for up to 20 years after dissolution. If the company is restored, the property reverts to the company as though it had never devolved to the State. Therefore property can pass into and out of State ownership without any involvement or without the explicit knowledge of the State. The provision on company restoration significantly restricts what the OPW can do with this property. This is because the Minister's interest is defeasible by company restoration for a significant period. A significant proportion of dissolved company property is the common areas of housing developments such as roads, footpaths, green areas, residual interests in long-term leases and so on. Most of this property is of little value and, in some cases, the dissolution of the developer company causes it to become State property. Another situation is that property is transferred into the ownership of a management company that was allowed to be dissolved. Ownership by the State does not prevent these areas being taken in charge by local authorities. It should be noted that the OPW is not the occupier and does not take over responsibility for the maintenance of these areas. The circumstances of property other than common areas of housing developments can be unique. A smaller, but not insignificant, category is where former directors remain in occupation but have sometimes inadvertently allowed the company to be dissolved. They often approach the OPW seeking a waiver of the Minister's interests under section 31 of the State Property Act 1954. The power to waive his interest is the only specific power granted to the Minister in the relevant part of the Act. Former directors as a rule are not deemed to be entitled to a waiver. Very few properties of value devolve to the State, especially properties on which there is no competing claim. Despite the volume of properties devolving to the State as a result of company dissolution, the OPW on behalf of the Minister is not managing a portfolio of valuable properties.Each situation and application to waive property rights is examined carefully in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's office, as to whether it is an application for a waiver or a situation that involves risk or liability. It is a complex legal area and as such there are specific matters to be considered such as ownership and property rights before a decision can be taken for the Minister to waive ownership of such properties. In the past five years a total of ten waivers were granted and the total number for the five years 2018-2022 was 30 waivers.

We are not looking for a waiver in a situation like this. We want to know who owns the land. The Minister of State clarified that the OPW deals with real property that devolves to the State. Therefore, I feel this is in the hands of the OPW. In this instance, the company is not restored so the property has not revert to the company. The Minister of State made the point that in the area of dissolved-company property, the common areas of housing developments are of little value. This is a tiny strip. It is of no value. Is this a situation where the local authority should take this in charge? The estate has taken it in charge. If that is the case, the Minister of State might be able to respond that the council could take this in charge as a petition from the housing estate. I appreciate the area is complex. Again I specify that we are not seeking a waiver but rather want to ensure both residents and the ESB have access to this tiny strip of land and that we are able to resolve the current issue.

I clarified that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility and that the OPW is the section of that Department which deals with this. Second, a company can be restored for up to 20 years after dissolution. That is the reason the State is reluctant to carry out any development or works on bits of land it may own during that period. With respect to taking in charge, the note I have tells me that ownership by the State does not prevent these areas being taken in charge by local authorities and that it is a complex legal area. It is a question for local government. It should be asked directly of the executive, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I would be happy to help with any other question the Senator wants to send to me or to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan. As a former councillor, I was involved in many taking in charge episodes, ransom strips, pieces of land and disputes between neighbours over small pieces of land. I understand that even if it does not have a particular financial value, it can have a significant social value or cause a lot of disruption within a community.

There are currently ten toll roads on the national road network, eight of which are operated under a public-private partnership, PPP, model and two of which are operated directly on behalf of TII, namely, the M50 and the Dublin Port Tunnel. TII recently announced that it plans to increase toll charges on nine of these roads in line with inflation from 1 January 2023. The only exception to this will be the Dublin Port Tunnel which will be the only toll road not to face an increase. Charges relate to those driving cars with charges higher again for those driving vans, buses and heavy goods vehicles, HGVs. The Government needs to step in to ensure this does not happen. As the Minister of State will be aware, we are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis and the Government's emphasis to date - and rightly so - has been on measures to reduce the cost of public services for many hard-pressed families and businesses. The decision of TII flies in the face of Government policy. These private companies are already making millions of euro. It begs the question, how can TII justify increasing toll charges to the maximum permitted value at this point in time?Just last month, for example, the M3 toll operator reported €11 million in profit for the previous financial year. Many commuters are totally dependent on the private car. In places like County Monaghan, where I come from, there is no reliable public service transport available to people, so they have no option but to use their car and hit the road. Increasing these charges at this point in time will have the effect of people avoiding these toll charges and taking roads through small villages and towns; that is not what we are looking to see happen. It is clear that the Government needs to call a halt to this. Common sense needs to prevail. I look forward to the Minister of State's response; I hope it will indicate that process is under way.
#OssianSmyth	unknown-#OssianSmyth-party	unknown-#OssianSmyth-dob	unknown-#OssianSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	9	The Minister for Transport has the responsibility for overall policy and Exchequer funding in relation to the national roads programme. Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 and in line with the national development plan, the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for TII in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Matters relating to day-to-day operations regarding national roads, including toll roads and the establishment of a system of tolls, are a statutory function of TII. More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, make toll bye-laws and enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended. The Act does not provide for a consultative function with the Minister regarding specific toll increases. There are 11 toll roads in the State and of these, ten are on the national road network. Of the ten tolls on the national road network, two are essentially public tolls, namely, the M50 and the Dublin tunnel. Revenue from these tolls is collected directly for TII by operating companies under contract to TII. These revenues are invested by TII in the operation and maintenance of the national road network. The other eight roads are public private partnership, PPP, roads which were constructed and are now operated and maintained under long-term contracts with TII. Revenue generated by these roads is collected by the PPP company and is then used to repay loans arising from the construction of the road and to fund ongoing operations and maintenance activities. Tolls on the eight PPP roads and the M50 were increased at the start of this year, which was the first increase in toll rates for motor cars since 2013. The setting of tolls is a statutory function of Transport Infrastructure Ireland. In line with that statutory function, the TII board agreed to a toll increase in 2023 on the M50. TII has also reviewed and agreed with the toll increases submitted by the PPP companies for the eight PPP routes. There will be no changes to toll rates for the Dublin tunnel. Tolls are due to increase because of the consumer price index, CPI, calculations carried out for each year. The CPI increased by 8.6% between August 2021 and August 2022; this has resulted in increased tolls on all eight PPP schemes and on the M50. The bye-laws for each individual toll scheme set out the basis for calculating the maximum toll for each year. On the M50, a deferral of the toll increase would require funding to be allocated from other national roads projects and would reduce funding for asset management and renewal activities across the rest of the network. This toll revenue plays a key role in protecting and maintaining our national road network and it safeguards the investments which have taken place in the network over recent decades. As required by the legislation, TII will shortly publish details of the proposals in the national media prior to their introduction.

If one were to go by speculation and comment from our political leaders in recent days, it would seem that this matter is now being reconsidered. I welcome that. I do not need to tell the Minister of State how difficult times are for many families, workers and businesses. The Government has intervened in the cost of public services; that is to be welcomed and it is good to see. This is another area where Government can intervene and I would welcome it were it to do so. Apart from the additional financial burden that would be placed on people, it will also result in people using alternative routes to avoid motorways, thereby resulting in our villages and towns being clogged up, which is the last thing we need.I hope common sense will prevail. I look forward to an outcometo which we can all sign up.

I appreciate his point that if the toll is set too high, it could lead to traffic entering city centres. Unfortunately, I was not at the Cabinet meeting today to know whether a decision was taken or whether there was a discussion on this, but I will update the Senator on the matter later today. The Government has identified transport as an area to target for cost-of-living mitigation measures. There was a reduction in public transport fares, both a 20% reduction for everybody and a 50% reduction for young people. Actions were taken like the licensed haulage emergency support scheme and there were reductions in the excise duty of 20 cent on petrol per litre and 50 cent on diesel per litre. Regarding tolls, as I outlined, it is a statutory function of TII and it is under contract with the operator; that does not mean nothing can be done, but it is the TII's statutory area. I think the Senator understands that. What the State will do in response, we will have to wait and see. I will apprise the Senator as soon as I have more information.

They are welcome to Leinster House. It is great to see them; we do not see enough of them. As I said earlier in the dining room, I look forward to many of them competing in the next elections, be they Dáil or Seanad elections. We can have the women's caucus and other groups but it is important that we bring them into the centre of politics and into elections. I asked the Minister to make a statement on the inclusion of genetically-modified, GM, ingredients used in animal feedstuff used for sheep, cattle and poultry and if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would confirm the level of GM foodstuffs in the agricultural sector. That was somewhat modified by the Commencement Matterbefore us. Genetically-modified food is a big issue; it is a controversial one for some. It was initially brought to my attention by the Irish Rural Association. I will read a post from its Facebook page because it is the kernel of the issue, "So now we are asking for a bit of help from you all out there who may use animal feedstuff in bags for cattle, sheep, hens, etc. Have you actually read the label?" On close examination, many of the feeds have a label that states, "Produced from genetically-modified soya beans... Does that bother anyone?" It raises the questions, should we know more about it? Is the labelling clear enough, is it big enough? Are people aware of it? It goes on to state, "As for GM foods and crops, the hypocrisy on the part of both Ireland and EU is stunning. While we pat ourselves on the back for banning the growing of GM crops, we import GM corn and soya by the millions of tonnes".How do Bord Bia, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine square the circle in terms of the export of Irish beef when on average the contents of a bag of winter feed for beef consists of 94% of genetically modified, GM, corn, soya and alfalfa. That is the kernel of the issue and we need more education about it. It is not banned but we need greater labelling. I am more interested to know how the Department quantifies the amount. Does it keep a record of the amount because that is really important? What is going on in terms of Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia on the monitoring of GM food and GM foodstuffs?
#PippaHackett	unknown-#PippaHackett-party	unknown-#PippaHackett-dob	unknown-#PippaHackett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	14	I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter. In Ireland more than 80% of animal feed for ruminants is provided by grass, hay and silage, complemented where appropriate by compound feeds. From an animal feed perspective, the pig, poultry and dairy sectors in particular rely on high-protein feed rations that are primarily made up of soya bean and maize by-products. Ireland has a limited capacity to grow certain protein crops and is therefore more dependent on feed imports relative to other EU member states. Climatic conditions in Ireland are traditionally not suited to the cultivation of soya bean although improvements in crop breeding and the availability of new varieties may change that. Therefore we are particularly dependent on the global market for supplies of high-quality vegetable protein. Total annual feed production in 2021 was 5.4 million tonnes, an increase of 6% on the previous year, of which 1.3 million tonnes was home-grown, mainly cereals. In 2021 4.1 million tonnes of feed material was imported which was a reduction of 3% compared to 2020. Of the 4.1 million tonnes imported, approximately 75% is sourced from third countries, mainly Argentina, the USA, the UK, Canada, Brazil and, historically, Ukraine. Significant quantities of maize and oilseed rape meal are also imported from EU member states.  Some 2.3 million tonnes of imported feed from third countries was genetically modified, representing 42% of the total animal feed production. The main genetically modified feeds imported are maize and maize by-products, soya bean meal and soya hulls. More than 1 million tonnes of this imported genetically modified feed was maize or maize by-products, distillers dry grains and maize gluten feed. Approximately 800,000 tonnes was soya bean and soya meal. These consignments are imported from genetically modified, GM, producing regions especially in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. It is important to the Irish agriculture industry, especially the sectors requiring rations with high-protein content, that there is a consistent supply of quality feed that is not subject to delays as there is limited scope for alternative protein substitution from home or from EU-grown high-protein crops. In terms of the use of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, in feed, the reality is that the feed materials containing GM make up the bulk of the market and provide the lowest cost source of proteins for feed manufacturers to use in their products. It should be borne in mind that there is a significant additional cost of approximately €60 to €100 per tonne for non-GM feed which can leave livestock production in Ireland at a competitive disadvantage compared to other countries that have the capacity to produce soya and other protein crops. This price differential would have a trickle-down effect on the overall feed prices which have already seen significant rises since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The EU has a legislative framework in place for the authorisation of feed products consisting of, or containing, genetically modified ingredients on the markets of member states. Only GM feed that has been authorised by the EU can be placed on that market. All applications for authorisation by the EU to place feed products consisting of, or containing, genetically modified ingredients on the markets of member states are considered individually. Government policy is positive but precautionary on biotechnology and a common voting position is adopted by Ireland for food and feed on the basis of a favourable opinion from the European Food Safety Authority and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Advance notification of feed imports is a legal requirement and imports containing GM are notified accordingly. My Department carries out risk-based analysis and testing for the presence of authorised and non-authorised GM in feed imports.

I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply. The three important things from that are that the Government needs to demonstrate its caution, that we need to see more statistics in terms of the testing and that is something I can take up with the agriculture committee, of which I am a member, and that many people are not aware of GM feedstuffs in animals. We talk at great length about not growing GM produce in this country but we are feeding our animals - sheep, poultry and cattle for beef - with this modified food.There is a little bit of misunderstanding but we need bigger labelling and more education and to be upfront and open, honest and transparent with the fact that we are using GM foods to feed animals in this country. I thank the Minister of State.

We have limited capacity to grow our own and more growing of our own is something that the Department has tried to support in the past year, as we cannot grow GM food in Ireland. In this regard the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, recently announced a second tillage incentive scheme which has as its focus the purpose of increasing the amount of grain and forage that will be essentially home-grown, as in grown here in Ireland with the aim of converting grassland to tillage use. It is widely acknowledged that the first tillage incentive scheme contributed approximately a 6% increase in tillage area or an additional 20,000 ha in 2022. In addition to this the protein aid scheme which is a payment to farmers for growing other protein crops such as beans, peas and lupins also works to increase domestic production of protein crops. These crops, which are also nitrogen fixing, provide important environmental benefits as a co-benefit. We need to grow more of our own and we are aspiring to do so.

I requested this Commencement debate because it is a very important topic for 35,000 sheep farmers in the country and is particularly of huge interest for farmers in County Louth who have nearly 70,000 sheep between them. Today I am asking what actions have been taken by the Department since the wool feasibility study was published last July and for an update on the establishment of the Irish wool council to which the Department has committed €30,000 to help establish. I do not have to tell the Minister of State about what an incredible product wool is but for the record it is one of the most regenerative and sustainable products known to us. The fleece grows every year and needs to be sheared off to keep the sheep in good condition. Wool is such a valuable resource and until modern times was the very fabric of our clothes and the bedding we slept in. Wool lasts longer than synthetic fibres and requires washing at lower temperatures. It is recyclable, biodegradable and does not contribute to any microplastic pollution. Wool can act as a fertiliser, releasing nutrients and carbon back into the soil when disposed of. It does not accumulate in landfill or oceans as it biodegrades naturally. There are so many other reasons to be positive about wool but sadly we are failing to act swiftly enough on this in so many ways. The first is by not utilising the product adequately; the second is by not educating consumers effectively; the third is by not creating a market and supporting and assisting producers and processors and the final way is by not supporting the farmers to deal with the wool. The ignoring of the situation by successive Governments has led to a situation where the value of wool is so low it is costing the farmer to clip their sheep and they do not make any profit on the product. This is a greatest of all sins in my opinion. I am old enough to remember selling wool at the end of the summer and we would pick up every scrap of wool off the ground and our fields because it was worth something. It was important and it was valuable. Now there is no support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deal with this. There is a short-term way to support farmers. They could be supported by making an additional payment to the new sheep improvement scheme that was opened by the Department today. It could specifically assist farmers with the costs associated with shearing and handling wool, and sorting out the dagging and the bagging of wool in a clean way, which has to be done for the wool merchant. It would be a really important way and a positive opportunity to assist and support farmers. As the Minister of State is probably aware, Ulster Wool scheme is a farmer-owned co-operative has been hailed as an example of collective marketing and praised for its success in improving prices for sheep farmers in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, they are selling wool through the Ulster Wool scheme and there are huge opportunities for all of us to work together to develop a unique brand for Irish wool. I believe in this work and that is why I have asked the Minister of State for an update today because it is really important and I have no doubt but that the Minister of State is a big advocate and a pusher of this project.

The sheep sector is extremely important to the Cooley Peninsula and to County Louth as a whole. I agree wholeheartedly with all the positive benefits she has outlined in the context of wool. The production of wool is an important aspect of the agriculture industry. According to data from the 2021 sheep census, there were just over 4 million sheep kept in registered herds in the country on 31 December 2021. This represents an increase of approximately 120,000 on the total numbers recorded for 2020. The sheep census also indicates an increase in the number of registered herds from 35,500 in 2020 to over 42,000 in 2021. Approximately 3 million sheep were slaughtered in 2021. In terms of producing wool for sale, farmers generally outsource the sheering of sheep and the selling of wool to agents. Officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine oversee and inspect 41 approved and registered wool stores where wool is held while awaiting sale. Ireland has always had a reputation for producing wool. Irish genetic breeding standards, sheep care requirements and the availability of quality grass, water and nutritional supplementation on Irish sheep farms all contribute to this reputation. Irish sheep have a high animal health status. They are free from diseases such as sheep pox that, when present, downgrade wool quality. Furthermore, Irish sheep farmers follow strict biosecurity and quality assurance guidelines. The animal husbandry on Irish sheep farms also ensures that programmes are in place to control ectoparasites such as sheep scab that can downgrade wool quality where not controlled. All of these factors contribute to the excellent quality of Irish wool. Most wool produced in Ireland is sold at the Bradford wool market in the UK. Current prices are disappointingly low. Industry sources have stated that wool prices for this year are similar to previous years, at around 20 cent per kilo for lowland wool. I know, first hand, how disappointing this is for sheep farmers who do such tremendous work to ensure the fleece is in good condition at shearing time. One of the commitments in the current programme for Government is to conduct a review of the potential demand for wool-based products such as for insulation and fertilisers in domestic and international markets. Despite its versatility in many industries, wool prices remain low. In order to address this issue and seek a more favourable outlook for the future, I initiated a comprehensive review of the wool industry to explore market opportunities in order to maximise the potential of this valuable natural resource. Following the allocation of €100,000 funding in budget 2021 for this review, a public consultation process was initiated in March 2021 to determine the terms of reference and to invite interested stakeholders to submit their proposals on the potential market opportunities for wool products. There were 45 submissions made. Following a competitive public procurement procedure, the Agile Executive, a consortium made up of experts from Munster Technological University and Donegal Yarns, was appointed in November 2021 to carry out the wool review and examine the submissions received under the public consultation process. The Agile Executive produced a report on the findings of the review. It was published in July 2022. This independently compiled report contains a number of findings and recommendations, including in respect of potential funding streams, market opportunities and multiple areas for additional research and development for wool. One of the main recommendations was the establishment of an independent wool council, led by industry, that would develop and promote Irish wool domestically and internationally and bring together multiple stakeholders to foster collaboration, innovation and scaling activities in the wool sector. It is envisaged that this council would be a forum where stakeholders could further examine and explore the potential uses for wool identified in the wool feasibility report. When I launched the report, I called on stakeholders and industry to come together to form an independent, stakeholder-led wool council. I also committed that, following the formation by industry of a wool council representative of a broad range of stakeholders, my Department would provide financial assistance of €30,000 towards the initial set-up costs of the group. I am pleased to inform the House that a group of stakeholders from across the wool industry have taken the initial steps towards the formation of a wool council. My officials and I have been engaging with that group to ensure that farm organisations will form a part of this council along with other stakeholders. I apologise for running over time a bit. I will be as quick as I can. Late last week, I received confirmation that the initial group of stakeholders which contacted my Department had engaged with farm organisations with a view to their inclusion in the council. The next logical step is a meeting between the relevant stakeholders and for the stakeholders to agree among themselves their common aims as a group, as well as agreeing the means by which the group wishes to go about completing the necessary formalities associated with its establishment. The next logical step is a meeting between the relevant stakeholders and for the stakeholders to agree among themselves their common aims as a group and the means by which it wishes to go about completing the necessary formalities associated with its establishment. While such formalities are likely to include proposed corporate governance structures, I have written to a representative of the stakeholders to suggest the Department give a brief presentation at their initial meeting as to the requirements that will need to be satisfied from the Department's perspective in order for the seed funding towards the establishment of the wool council to be drawn down. An independent stakeholder-led Irish wool council is something we need to see established in the short term to help drive our ambitions for the industry, so I have suggested in the same correspondence that this initial meeting of stakeholders take place next month. The industry-led wool council will create a roadmap that will lead to greater returns for this natural and sustainable product. Having a wide range of interests represented in a body that acts as an Irish wool champion for the entire sector will help boost the industry and create a clearer vision of the future of Irish wool. It is my hope the council can build on the valuable findings of that report and create a pathway towards maximising the true potential of Irish wool. This can be an exciting time for the wool industry and we must all work hard together to deliver on that.

It is good news that the meeting will start next month and I look forward to it. It is very important. Unfortunately, the wheels of bureaucracy turn slowly, and I reiterate there is a space for supporting sheep farmers in the new sheep improvement scheme. Being able to shear sheep is a sheep welfare issue. When the Minister of State said agents usually shear sheep, she made it sound as though there is a massive output, but it is usually a young farmer who shears a few other farmers' sheep. It is not a large agency that comes in to do it. Alternatively, it is done by farmers themselves, as is the case in the Cooley Peninsula. In any event, it costs a great deal to look after these sheep and shear their wool. I look forward to further updates on this because it is very important.

I recently saw some photos of what could have been an organic horticultural grower that was using wool in its polytunnels as the mulch and insulator, which it had bought from a neighbouring farmer, with nice symbiosis. That is just one example, and there are plenty of others throughout the country. I often get correspondence asking why we do not do this. The opportunity is there and the sooner we get the wool council up and running, the better the outlook for our sheep farmers and that wonderful wool, which is always of high quality.

From the great state of Massachusetts we are joined by Representative Daniel Carey and his wife. I thank them for joining us in the Seanad while they are on their honeymoon. We are delighted they are able to come here. We had the American ambassador in earlier. We hope they enjoy thanksgiving this week. We appreciate the long and distinguished relationship between Ireland and the United States of America and especially Massachusetts which became home to so many people from all over this island. We look forward to them coming back and celebrating 2026, which is the 250th anniversary of American independence. George Washington acknowledged the great links between Ireland and the United States of America at that time when the war was being lost and he said that when America's flags were friendless, Ireland's sons were its only friends. We greatly appreciate them coming to Seanad Éireann today. The other group I would like to welcome to Seanad Éireann today is from Claremont. They are from the deaf community. I thank Senator Boyhan for bringing them in today. Seanad Éireann played a key role in the recognition of Irish Sign Language. The very fact that we have a sign language interpreter in the Chamber is because we passed the legislation in this regard. The Ceann Comhairle put together a policy on sign language interpreters. Through the legislation passed, with the support of all sides in Seanad Éireann, members of the deaf community are able to access Government services. We are delighted they have come here today as citizens of this State to their Parliament and that they are able to understand what is going on in their own language. We are delighted Senator Boyhan brought people who have been in Claremont to the Seanad today. I thank them for visiting.

I apologise as I do not know any Irish Sign Language. I thank the guests for attending today and Senator Boyhan for bringing them in. I congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Carey. It really must be the honeymoon period if they are in Leinster House during their honeymoon. They are very welcome. I wish them a long and happy life together. The Order of Business today is No. 1, Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022 – Second Stage, to be taken at 4.45 p.m. and to conclude at 6.15 p.m., if not previously concluded, with the time allocated for opening remarks of the Minister not to exceed ten minutes, group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, and their time can be shared, with the Minister to be given no less than eight minutes in which to reply to the debate; and No. 2, Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill 2022 – Committee Stage, resumed, to be taken at 6.30 p.m. and to adjourn at 8.30 p.m. if not previously concluded.

One relates to a bus link for Rathangan. I spoke two weeks ago about public transport in respect of the need to extend the short-hop zone and create a medium-hop zone. Most certainly, rural transport deserves to have its place too. There are a number of issues I want to raise, from a lack of connectivity to absolutely deplorable reliability. I have been working closely, or trying to work closely, with the National Transport Authority on a number of problem routes in my area, south Kildare. One is the 129 route from Kilcullen to Newbridge. The bus on this route is well known for not turning up at all. The 120 bus route is an ongoing saga. In many cases, people attempt to use the 120 to get to work but unfortunately it does not arrive. Rathangan, my home village, has been trying to get a Local Link bus service to run every day, including Saturday and Sunday and in the evenings, as the transport links are almost non-existent. Rathangan's population has been growing and it has many new estates. It is unacceptable that the links are not much better than they are. There is only one Transport for Ireland bus, which runs twice daily from Monday to Friday, at 6.50 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. There is no connectivity whatsoever on Saturday and Sunday. We also need to connect Allenwood and Rathangan, particularly to service those who work at and want to visit Lullymore Heritage Park. I call for a more regular and reliable bus service for the people of Rathangan that will cater better for those living in villages and provide better onward connectivity for commuters. I also want to raise an equestrian issue. We have a top-class equestrian sector in Kildare and, indeed, the rest of the country. In this regard, Ireland is renowned right around the world. Kildare is at the heart of the sector. Unfortunately, Brexit has had repercussions that have affected domestic breeders. At a recent meeting with Ms Cathy Grassick, chair of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, she told me there has been a decrease of 27.5% in the number of mares in the past two years. That represents a huge loss of income for Irish breeders due to Brexit. There are many knock-on effects. There is a loss of income to Irish stud farms and ancillary services such as veterinary, farrier and transport services. Therefore, thoroughbred breeders are experiencing significant hardship. The declining numbers have coincided with a strengthening of the UK-based stallion pool and an anti-competitive scheme for British born, bred and sired horses in the form of the great British bonus scheme.We need to have an extension of the IRE Incentive scheme. I am asking that the Brexit readjustment fund could be used for that. We could have a debate on it.  I want to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. I propose that No. 22 be taken before No. 1, which relates to the climate survey from BelongTo that I raised last week. It is and should be of huge concern to so many of us. I acknowledge the work of the Minister, Deputy Foley, in this area; the review that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently doing; and, of course, the announcement last week that there would be an upskilling for teachers in relationships and sexuality education, RSE. In 2019, the Oireachtas education committee did a very thorough report. It engaged with 54 different sets of stakeholders and produced an all-party group of strong recommendations that should be put in place to help support our young people to have healthy relationships and address inequality, human sexuality, gender identity and, of course, the influence of digital media.

I congratulate State Representative Carey and his good wife Melissa on their magnificent wedding and I congratulate him on his re-election as a state representative of Massachusetts. I stand today to ask us all to reflect upon the events of the past four days. Five people were killed in a nightclub in Colorado last Saturday night on a night out in a space where, for many of us as gay people, it is our place of sanctuary where we can be free to be who we are with our loved one and our friends. Five people were senselessly gunned down in a nightclub. We remember them today, their families and those who survived that awful attack last Saturday night. In parallel with that, we have the FIFA World Cup under way as we speak. Just imagine eight captains were told by the governing body of soccer that they cannot wear a One Love armband.

FIFA, the governing body of one of the biggest sporting organisations in the world, lacks leadership and courage. It is disgusting, appalling and unacceptable. I do not get pretty emotional about things in this Chamber but what are we saying when an American journalist is for 25 minutes stopped from going into the stadium because he wore a rainbow or LGBT t-shirt? The former captain of the Welsh soccer team had her LGBT hat taken off her. Gay people are told come to Qatar but they cannot be who they are. They report back that they are feeling unwelcome and afraid, and then add to it all the governing body of FIFA said nothing about leadership. Nothing. What are the events of the past four days saying to the young boy and girl, whether in Cork, Kerry, Dubai, Doha, Indonesia or Colorado when they are grappling with their sexuality and their sexual identity? What are they saying? What are we as a society in the world saying? Our language and our behaviour matters. I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs come to the House for a debate on human rights and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, as I requested last week, come to the House for a debate on the awarding of sporting events to countries such as Qatar.  I ask us today to remember the five people, young men and women, and give thanks - as the Cathaoirleach said, in this week of Thanksgiving in the United States of America - to the bravery of the people who apprehended that gunman in that nightclub, which is a place of sanctuary and safety for us in the LGBT community.

There is, as the Senator pointed out, cause and effect, with large organisations like FIFA awarding the World Cup to a country where there is discrimination against members of the LGBT community. FIFA is sending out a message by doing that. The actions and the silence in the context of the symbols of that community being forcibly removed from people who are wearing them sends its own message. FIFA has acted shamefully and has brought great shame on the sport of soccer. Many others who are involved in sport have stayed silent as well, which reflects badly on them. A debate on the matter would be appropriate, because there is a cause and an effect.

I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that No. 128(5) be taken before No. 1. No. 128(5) states:That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to name the new National Children’s Hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn, noting her contribution as Chief Medical Officer in the Irish Citizen Army, and her role in establishing St. Ultan’s Hospital, one of the most important centres for paediatric healthcare in the early years of the Irish State. I would like to touch on the issue of Claremont. I thank the Leader for organising the sign language interpreter. It was an emotional day for me because all of the people in this audience are in their 50s and 60s. All of them were in my primary school. The difference was that we were in one building and they were in a prefabricated building with the rain pouring in. This was because there was no integration for deaf children in the 1960s and 1970s. What was unusual about this particular group was that they were all raised in the faith of the Anglican Church of Ireland. The families had to mobilise themselves, hire out an old prefabricated building in a school in Monkstown village in Dún Laoghaire and have their children educated. They were not encouraged to learn in sign language at that time. It was not policy to do so. There was a pilot scheme for a school in Cabra. It allowed them to have their own identity. We talk about identity a lot in this House. They were Church of Ireland and their family wanted them to have a non-denominational education or a choice within education. I invited them here today. I had not seen any of them for over 50 years but I remember them all. When we met there were many tears and much laughter and a great sense of sound and excitement came from them, as one who deals with deafness knows. Many of them are profoundly deaf. Through our interpreter we had a conversation and I want to share three things. The strongest thing was that many people found it difficult to get a job or secondary education. They also found it difficult to sustain a relationship. More importantly, we talked about the following matter and someone asked me to bring it wherever it needed to be brought. People with disabilities do not cease to have sexual needs. This is a matter we do not discuss - it is another taboo subject - but we all need to feel loved, wanted and accepted. We all want confirmation, affirmation and an abundance of love. That is a human need for everyone and that is my message. Through the disability sector we must continue to be strong advocates for people in residential care. At a time when we are talking about physical, mental, emotional and sexual abuse in institutions, we should think about what it must have been like to have been deaf or to be a blind child in the blind asylum in Merrion. There were all the other institutions that were meant to care for people. Think about all the people who had psychiatric illnesses. They were vulnerable. Many of them do not have the power or ability to advocate or talk.Many of them have that all locked and trapped within themselves. When we talk about all these things, it is important to remember to somehow take a look back to advocate and facilitate organisations that represent an elder group of people who were perhaps aged over 60 who were in these institutions. They, too, were hurt and feel forgotten. More importantly, however, many of them do not have the skills or ability to communicate and be a voice for themselves.

It would be very important to have it during the World Cup, if possible. I also wish to raise issue of football. It is fair to say that the FAI has had a turbulent recent history. A criminal inquiry into FAI matters brought by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is ongoing. One would have thought that having gone through all of these horrendous recent scandals, the FAI would now understand the absolute importance of transparency, good governance and the value of an audit. I regret to have to inform the House that this is not the case. An ongoing row involving the Limerick district soccer league has caused huge frustration among the vast majority of honourable people who make up the bulk of soccer players, coaches, parents and supporters. Key concerns are the failure to conduct an audit of accounts for 2020 alongside a failure to adopt a series of governance reforms such as introducing term limits and, Lord protect us, actually appointing at least one woman to one of the 12 board positions. At the heart of this story is an all-male board of management of the Limerick district league. A number of the officers have held key positions for so long that they would make the leadership of the Workers' Party of North Korea blush. Some of these men can boast of being in situ for between 30 and 35 years. The concerned club members want a time limit placed on the term in office of committee members, limiting it to a few years rather than having a situation where people could potentially hold office for life. The new broom that was promised by the FAI certainly has not reached Limerick. Unfortunately, I am also informed that those clubs or individuals who have spoken up in favour of reform and good governance have found themselves and their clubs disadvantaged as a result. A number of these people told me they are operating under an atmosphere of fear and loathing because of the actions of the board. This is what happens when board management degenerates into a personal fiefdom. The need for an audit of accounts for 2020 is an issue that was described by the FAI itself as being of significant concern. Some of these concerns related to so-called honorarium payments made by officers to themselves, and others to issues of governance and transparency. Yet, over a year later, there has still been no audit carried out. The FAI issued 11 recommendations in all, including the need for term limits for committee members, the need to appoint at least one female committee member out of 12 and an updated rule book. To date, I am informed that the FAI has failed to ensure that any of these recommendations have actually been implemented. After all the FAI has been through in recent years, it beggars belief that having identified a series of recommendations to improve governance, it failed to ensure implementation of any of them. The senior management of the FAI has been made aware of all the issues but has to date failed to take any action. The FAI needs to act now. Otherwise, it should be called to account for its inaction on these matters before an Oireachtas committee. I will finish with quote from a press release that came from concerned supporters groups today. They said, “All we want is to see soccer in Limerick grow and for people and kids to get involved and to play, but without a change in governance we can’t go forward.” I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister with responsibility for sport on the topic of FAI governance and accountability. As far as the Limerick district league is concerned, there is in my opinion a significant deficit of both.

I believe it is important that this House is heard on that issue. Senator Buttimer has articulated that in a most brilliant way this afternoon. One unintended consequence, maybe if there is a light at the end of the road, is that the hosting of the World Cup in Qatar gives us all a dose of reality and hammers home to us that there are parts of the world that are not as lucky as we are and that so much work has yet to be done globally. That work starts in every single jurisdiction, home and democracy to try to right these awful, horrible wrongs that are still unapologetically alive and well in our society. In a brazen way, we must face that down and take a leaf out of Senator Buttimer's book.

People knew that this was going to happen as the World Cup taking place in Qatar, even though there have been human rights abuse in that place, has been spoken about for a long time. Unfortunately, we are not surprised by the situation there. It is a great shame that the captains of the soccer teams did not show leadership at a certain moment. I firmly believe that if they cannot show leadership by wearing an armband on a pitch, then I do not know what support they can offer a member of their team who may be a member of the LGBT community. I wish to talk about what happened in the East Wall over the past couple of days. My heart is broken thinking about the people who have fled war and sought safety and asylum here in Ireland. I cannot imagine how they are feeling. Let us imagine if any one of us had to leave Ireland to seek a better life and get a start for our families only to be met by what was, quite frankly, a baying mob. The scenes that I watched online were unbelievable and shocking. What happened over the weekend was disgraceful. I believe the community there is being manipulated by bad actors who seek to take advantage of a community that is weary from societal neglect and feel like they have been left behind. The extreme far right are thriving on seeding this panic. They will simply skip off into the sunset and find other places, which we have seen in Oughterard, Roosky, Moville and all over the country. They manoeuvre themselves around the place and whip up fear and hatred. They do absolutely nothing for communities outside of pitting them against each other. I want to put it on the record that immigrants do not come here and take anyone's jobs. If anyone was laid off in favour of cheap immigrant labour, then they need to blame the capitalist masters who decided that they wanted cheap labour and decided to take advantage of the immigrant to increase their profits with little or no care or regard for the consequences of their actions. It is that capitalist master who rubs his or her hands with glee as immigrants are blamed for the woes of society and the capitalist master is not blamed for his or her greed or endless pursuit of profit. Immigrants do not come here and take people's houses. They do not come here and take people's healthcare. They are not to blame for a scarcity of resources. Societal resourcing is the responsibility of the State, not the people who come here for a better life.  I wish to commend the members of the East Wall community who have gone to the site to let the frightened people there know that they are welcome here. I would like to make a point to those who have taken it upon themselves to fall into the trap of protesting that people are coming here for a better life. First, protestors would be better off not blaming immigrants for things that have been caused by decades of capitalist decisions. Second, they would be better off protesting the for-profit housing policies designed for speculators and big business. I join with the community in East Wall who have called for proper supports for the community there. They are currently in beds in partitions and big office spaces. I commend anyone who has said that refugees are welcome here and that they are not to be blamed for society's woes.

It was quite upsetting to see what happened in East Wall over the weekend because you come from a community, you have a certain algorithm on your social media and you see that it is people you care about and people you love who are sharing some of those sentiments.It can be difficult to step into those conversations with people you care about while also having some sort of understanding as to what may have led to the position whereby they are sharing that stuff online or joining in with the mob. We must try to come at this with a certain analysis or insight that allows for a lack of defensiveness in order that we can have those conversations. Unfortunately, those who fall into the trap of the anti-immigrant narrative that is being fed to them often have very little power, agency and autonomy in their everyday lives. I sometimes wonder whether it is the human condition to seek power over other people. If we have little power, how can we exercise power and autonomy in our everyday lives? If somebody comes along and tells people they can exercise their power in this particular direction, they may do so because they do not feel they have the capacity to exercise that power upwards at the State, administrative decisions, bureaucracy, politics and the concentration of power. They look to where they can exercise the little power they have. Unfortunately, we politicians sometimes buy into the same trap when people come to us saying immigrants were not vetted or there was no consultation. We then start saying there should be consultation. No, there should not be consultation. We should be empowering communities to be part of the humanitarian response. We should be empowering and resourcing communities to be the welcoming committees that are there and waiting for people to arrive. That is what the consultation should be. It is about being part of the process. Where we come from, who we are and where we were born is not our fault but it is our responsibility. We cannot always control who we are, what we are fleeing, the conditions we have grown up in and whether we have housing and safety, but it is our responsibility. For me, for communities like mine and for the people of East Wall, we should take that responsibility in another direction and with the good heart I know we all have because we extend it our neighbours on a daily basis. We need to call out racist and anti-immigrant sentiment. If questions are being asked as to why people were not vetted, where the women and children are and why there was no consultation, we need to remind people this is anti-immigrant sentiment and that we do not vet our neighbours when they move in next door. We do not vet people when a new estate opens in our community and new residents move into it. It is not a normal thing to vet people in those situations. We must stand up and say it when anti-immigrant sentiment is being expressed. We should not look to the mood of the electorate or whether the mob will vote for us to decide what we should or should not say. We must be strong and make sure the humanitarian response does not end by just letting people into the country.

I agree with the comments by Senators Hoey and Ruane on the importance of language and how we all have a responsibility to welcome refugees and asylum seekers to this country and challenge those who spread misinformation and untruths. I equally commend the contribution of Senator Buttimer highlighting the tragic events in Colorado and pointing out, once again, the disgrace that was the decision by FIFA to award the hosting of the World Cup to Qatar. I raise the statement in the High Court yesterday by Mr. Justice Meenan in which he referred to the "dramatic increase" in the number of actions against the HSE regarding the assessment of children with special needs. He said seven new applications are coming before the High Court each week involving parents who have to fight for their children in that situation. As legislators, I believe we have done a good job in this area in many ways. We passed the Disability Act. We have a very good disability committee, an excellent autism committee and an indefatigable Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, Deputy Rabbitte. There is unity in the House on this issue. We have heard people talk about what we can do for those with disabilities and learning difficulties. However, what really frustrates me and drives me mad is that family after family must resort to the courts to secure their rights. Almost inevitably, we see the same thing happen when those cases end up before the courts.In almost every single case, the parents have been dragged through the legal process. The courts will say the legislation, particularly under the Disability Act 2005, is very clear that the State has an obligation to provide for these children. However, this should not just be because it says it legislatively but because it is the right thing to do. I am tired of engaging with families and with people I know and care about who are having to fight their case all the time. It is not just the HSE in these cases. We are also talking about agencies such as the Department of Education. I still recall when Andrew Geary had to fight for his deaf son, Calum. Again, they were dragged to the steps of the High Court before the Department of Education finally settled. I know Senator Boyhan referred to this with regard to those who are deaf but we need a broader debate. It is no good us talking in this House about our legislative provision for those with a disability and special needs and about the work we do as politicians if, in the first instance, the approach of the HSE and the Department of Education, any time there is a challenge, is to lawyer up. This has to be a debate around the culture that exists within the State. When it comes to somebody with a disability, why are we not looking in the first instance at how we can provide the necessary supports at a local level? We talk about speech and language therapy and everything else, and it is quite often far cheaper to intervene at an earlier stage. There is a crucial Supreme Court decision coming up in this area which will uphold this, but we need a debate in this House and within broader society as to why it is, when we have made legislative provision very clearly and want to support these families, the State continues to drag them kicking and screaming to the doors of the High Court.

Last night we were treated to a view of two gardaí being beaten in Dublin. Sadly, it is not just Dublin; it is happening everywhere. Members of An Garda Síochána put on their uniforms and go out to work in the evenings expecting to come home in the same physical state. My own young brother, God be good to him, when he was a garda, was severely beaten on one occasion. At that particular time in his life, he was dealing with one of the most notorious criminals in Dublin, a man noted for vicious brutality. It is grossly unfair that members of An Garda Síochána are not at least sure of that, if they are assaulted, a mandatory prison sentence will be imposed. I place on record my total support for the position taken by the general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, last night on RTÉ. It is simply not good enough that those young men and women who protect us and keep us safe in our homes can be attacked in that vicious way and that the criminals, when they are caught, might not receive a prison sentence. On a second issue, Members will all recall the death six years ago of Caitríona Lucas, a member of the Irish Coast Guard volunteer group in the west. Ms Lucas's inquest has still not been held. Are the family not entitled to the closure an inquest will bring? It is outrageous at this stage and I ask the Leader to use her office to write to the coroner in Limerick to ask why there has not been an inquest. The Lucas family are entitled to closure, and if there are things to come out from that inquest that may be disturbing for people, then so be it. Let that happen but let us have the inquest.

What is there to oppose about that? In the documentation that has given rise to the public consultation, there is much talk about how it will be along the same lines as the plastic bag levy, which we know has been a huge success and which I, for one, absolutely support. Why would anyone not be in favour of a similar levy for coffee cups?The simple reason is that it is being applied completely inconsistently. The public consultation, as far as I can see, refers only to hot beverage cups and that is what is in the documentation that has gone with it, which ignores the fact the likes of McDonald's, Burger King and other fast-food outlets also sell Coke, 7-Up and so on in single-use disposable cups that are waxed and not recyclable. Globally, that accounts for more than 200 million cups a year, yet that is not the subject of this public consultation or of the proposed regulations from the State. Instead, the regulations propose to put a 20 cent levy on coffee cups from small, independent coffee shops. I fully support the idea that people should be conscious of the volume of waste they generate and should endeavour to use reusable cups, and the funny thing is these businesses do too. Small coffee shops in all our local areas, in places such as Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Glasthule, are some of the most environmentally conscious businesses in our economy. In fact, the vast majority of them sell coffee in compostable cups that are recyclable but cannot be recycled because local authorities do not have the facilities on street to gather and recycle them.  Why is the Government not targeting that? Why is it specifically proposing in the regulations that even compostable and recyclable cups will be subject to this levy, simply because it wants to target reuse? I am all for targeting reuse, but let us do it consistently across the sector. Let us also hit McDonald's, Burger King and other companies that produce non-recyclable, non-compostable waste that goes into landfill or incineration. It is something on which we should have a debate because the consultation will end this week and the regulations are due to come in next month. We should have a debate on the matter in this Chamber.

We are fortunate in this country that we have a community police force. The Garda depends on the support of the community and it invariably has the support of 90% of decent people. When this country was in difficulty during the Troubles, An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces stood between us and mayhem and chaos, with people trying to undermine the State. Many gardaí paid the ultimate price, not least my friend Jerry McCabe in Adare. We should express that support for the Garda Síochána. People are quick to criticise the organisation if a garda issues a parking fine or a speeding ticket or calls to a pub at closing time, for example, but communities should express the strong support they feel for the Garda Síochána. I am delighted to say that in my town tomorrow, the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, will lead a celebration of 100 years of the Garda Síochána, and I assure the House that every man and woman in Listowel who can be out will be there to celebrate with the Garda. I am sorry I cannot be there myself. On a separate issue, the banks are at it again. They are again making profits and were quick out of the traps when it came to increasing charges on both general lending and mortgage lending. At the same time, today's newspapers show that our banks pay the lowest rates of interest on deposit accounts in Europe. It is pitiful what they are paying in these inflationary times and when they are starting to make serious profits again. While they have quickly jacked up their lending rates, they are very slow to address their deposit rates. A large cohort of our citizens, elderly people, depend on perhaps a lump sum that has been deposited in the bank to keep them going. At this time of inflation, those savings are being eaten into and the bank is paying this niggardly rate of negligible interest. I ask the Minister for Finance to address this. We complained in the past about light regulation over the banks and rightly so. We need strong regulation now when it comes to banks paying decent deposit rates, especially to our elderly citizens.

We send the solidarity of the House, but I send it also as a person who was born and reared in Ballyfermot.We have to understand that not every single person in that community is a bad person. That is my message today. While we stand in solidarity with An Garda Síochána, we also stand in solidarity with the community of Ballyfermot and the young people who have to grow up in these communities. On today's Order of Business, I will also say that I know exactly what it is like to be oppressed in Irish society. On the increasing level of racism towards people who are fleeing war and coming here for international protection we have being seeing both on and off social media, as we say in my house, it is a mortal sin to treat people in such a disrespectful manner. It is not every single person in Ireland but a few. Again, coming from the community I come from, I know that we cannot target all people as being on the far right or as bad people. Senator Ruane and I were having a conversation about this with some other people last night. Not everybody in the host community means badly. Oppressed people can become oppressors and we have to look at why, although I am not excusing what happened in the past few days with regard to racism and discrimination. We, as leaders, and the Government have a role in rolling out campaigns to support people coming to our country from others. I stand in solidarity with and respect every single refugee in Irish society and I say to them now that they have millions of welcomes from the people of Ireland. A few might have stood against that welcome that day but I ask those refugees to put that aside because they have the support of the majority.

I refer to how they have been dealing with people who run businesses and who have other people's money, including that of clients, in their accounts. It has been scandalous to say the least. With regard to Croí Cónaithe, I have been dealing with the scheme for a number of months and we have found it to be a great success. There is certainly evidence that the scheme, brought in by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is very helpful and very positive. I have seen it in my own area. The owners of houses that had been laid up for quite a while have been approached and the houses bought and young people are now doing them up and moving into areas that have been neglected in recent years. We hear a lot of negativity with regard to housing but the Croí Cónaithe scheme and the €50,000 grant for older houses to be done up by first-time buyers has been a bright light. I commend and compliment the Minister in that regard. I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's latitude in allowing me to make a final point. As the Cathaoirleach will know, because we have discussed the matter here on a couple of occasions, my views on Russia's aggression in Ukraine are on the record. However, it is bit populist of people to call for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador. We are a neutral country and we have to keep channels of negotiation, discussion and persuasion open. I strongly feel that calls to send the Russian ambassador back to Russia are somewhat less than genuine.

There is also a community at the heart of this which is full of very good people who have a passion, care and love for each other and I am proud to say some of them are within my own family. I note for the House that at this moment the community in Ballyfermot is gathered around the Garda station there, supporting An Garda Síochána and demonstrating its abhorrence of the actions of that tiny minority, which is stigmatising the whole community there and in Cherry Orchard. I also welcome that on Thursday - this is not anything arising out of this week but has been long-planned and worked on over the past number of weeks by the Minister, Deputy McEntee - the Minister will be out in the community of Cherry Orchard discussing the progress that is being made on plans there to have an inter-agency and interdepartmental approach to solving some of the issues and challenges of that community. I support my colleague, Senator Buttimer. I also note that we need a debate on FIFA and the whole abhorrent decision to have the World Cup in Qatar. Anyone who did the slightest piece of research would have known that that was a country which was going to completely stand apart when it came to the treatment of people and would have no sense of human rights whatsoever. The stories coming out of the country over the past number of years have been horrific and it is modern-day slavery. Those stadia, which people are sitting in, are built with the blood of migrants to that country. It is appalling to support this World Cup in any way, shape or form. Yesterday the Iranian team did not sing its national anthem at 1 p.m. At 4.30 p.m. we all received a briefing document from the Iranian Embassy in our inboxes, which was 21 pages of propaganda, and, frankly, lies, claiming things are not the way they are, that there was no violence in the deaths that occurred, and that what we see and know is going on is not actually going on at all. I want to completely condemn the Iranian Embassy for having the audacity to send a such a document in. I sent the embassy back an email making my feelings known but it is a completely abhorrent thing for it to do, and for it to think that it might get away with such propaganda on such a large scale.

Decisions which led to the imposition of the three national lockdowns and the regional restrictions, together with measures such as working from home, the reduction of contact, and the use of face coverings will be examined. The chair, Baroness Heather Hallett, has said that those who suffered during the pandemic would be a part of the inquiry. This is the fifth time I have raised the issue of the complete absence of a Covid-19 inquiry in this country. The first time I did so was 16 months ago when, in my naivete, I took it for granted that such sweeping interventions into public life would be the subject of some critical appraisal in hindsight. More fool me to expect that the Chief Medical Officer and NPHET and the Cabinet, which handed over the reins of the country to them, would ever deign to admit that they had any mistakes to learn from. The writing was very much on the wall when the Government decided to wind down its one and only Covid-19 committee, competently chaired by Deputy McNamara, on 8 October 2020, snap-bang in the middle of the pandemic. The role of the committee was to consider and take evidence on the State’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. NPHET had to be dragged kicking and screaming in front of the committee to answer a few questions and a quiet word must have been had, because the order to wrap the committee up came soon thereafter. The Cabinet realised it was inconvenient that there should be such a forum for parliamentarians to which it would be responsible. Vaccinations were pushed on to children, when the data for doing so was inconclusive. We now know of at least one death which resulted from that and who knows how many more there may be. Now we are on to the next thing. I am sure it is the desire of the Government that we will just let bygones be bygones, sweep it under the carpet, not talk about it, and that in years to come, when we talk of Covid-19, there will be no lessons learned, no recognition of mistakes made or accountability for such.We will all just shake our heads and say, "Sure, that was awful, wasn't it?" and continue on blithely. It is state-sanctioned gaslighting at national scale and it will not work. The Government should man-up, set up an inquiry and face the music.

It is not a blight on a whole community but a blight on the individuals who carried out the act and those who filmed it and circulated it on social media. It should be rightly condemned. It is clear that there is an increasing lack of respect for the uniform and the profession of An Garda Síochána. It is an unarmed police force to care for and protect communities. I wholly condemn it. I disagree with the motion put forward by Senator Boyhan and the Independent group regarding the naming of the children's hospital. I have read something of Dr. Kathleen Lynn and I know that she was a fine woman. I have nothing against her or her work, lest anyone get me wrong, but I firmly believe that we should not agree to a motion about any name being put forward in the House, first, without a debate and, second, without going through a process of inviting groups to suggest other names, whether a woman or a man, and engaging. This has been a much-maligned project, as we know, over some time. I am proud to be part of the Government that, instead of talking about this for decades, went ahead and built this. I had the pleasure of visiting the facility last July. It is a world-class facility. The name should include the words "children's hospital" and "Ireland" rather than naming it after one individual. I strongly disagree with putting forward a motion here without a debate.

The Government has once again demonstrated that it is unwilling or unable to deal with the housing crisis. This weekend, a Government memo confirmed a housing budget underspend of almost €500 million so far this year. Just days ago, the Minister finally acknowledged what most independent experts and Sinn Féin have been saying for a long time, namely, the targets the Government is setting are too low. The Government effectively admitted that even if it meets its low targets, the crisis will continue. Yet it continues to fail to meet even these modest targets. Houses, much like Dublin buses, disappear off the radar, never to be accounted for again. Unfortunately, with each year of under-supply, the overall housing need increases further. We have now met an unprecedented point in the housing crisis. In the last 12 months rents across the State have increased by an average of 14% to an average of €1,688. In Dublin, the average rent is now €2,258 a month. Six education trade unions have this week issued a joint statement that the effective delivery of education is now fundamentally at risk because of the housing crisis. Schools and colleges cannot recruit and retain critical staff. They cannot get teachers. Children in emergency or unsuitable accommodation struggle to find a place to do their homework. Many young people are deferring their further education due to lack of accommodation.  The Minister may deny that this is an emergency. Sinn Féin will table a motion in the Dáil calling for a housing emergency to be declared. People will take to the streets on Saturday making their voices heard at the Raise the Roof rally. I commend them on it. It is time for the Government to listen to the people on the street, declare a housing emergency and introduce measures to help those struggling.

The Bill's purpose is to introduce a stronger, mandatory, sentence for anyone convicted of assaulting an emergency worker in the course of his or her duty.It successfully passed through Second Stage here some time ago and has now proceeded to Committee Stage. We have taken the lead from other jurisdictions, namely parts of Australia, New Zealand, parts of France, England and Scotland, which have already moved to introduce mandatory prison sentencing for anyone who assaults an emergency worker. Unfortunately, assaults on emergency workers are on the increase. We noted the horrific assault over the weekend of two members of the Garda, a man and woman going about their duty to protect the community they serve. Unfortunately, other professionals, be they nurses, paramedics, doctors or others in the medical setting, have been also subjected to an increasing number of assaults. It is time we called a halt and protected those who go out daily and put their lives on the line to protect us. I am disappointed by the lack of progress on the legislation. Again, I call on the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to embrace it. I am not saying it is perfectly scripted but its aim is to send a clear message to anyone who would assault an emergency worker in the course of duty that we will not stand for it. I hope the Minister will make progress in the legislation as a matter of urgency.

Club Q was the heart of the LGBT community. I hail those who put their lives on the line to stop the attack. It is absolutely incredible. As has been mentioned, I support the Garda today on the work it does in our communities day in, day out. The incident that has been mentioned was shocking. We need to stand up for our gardaí, as at the vigil now taking place in Ballyfermot. What occurred was an attack on our society. The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has spoken about this. She called it an absolutely despicable act and will be taking action on it. Let me take the opportunity on the Order of Business to speak about European Commission funding. A stimulus package of more than €217 million has been allocated to the Northern & Western Regional Assembly under European regional development funds. The Southern Regional Assembly takes on the southern area and there is also an assembly for the east, but the counties in the north and west have been designated a region in transition. The European Commission has indicated that, per capita, supports in that region are lower than in the rest of the country. The stimulus package is about building a more competitive region, smart specialisation and regional enterprise plans. It is also about energy efficiency. It will cover the retrofitting of homes. We know already that the west has some of the oldest housing in the country. The funding will support sustainable regeneration. All the elements, including Town Centre First, urban regeneration and rural regeneration, are crucial, but the funding will really support the Atlantic Technological University, with a focus on bringing industry, enterprise and jobs to the west. We want to see more people choosing the west as a place to live and work because it has the best quality of life. I thank the Northern & Western Regional Assembly, its director, Mr. David Minton, its chairperson, and Galway county councillor Mr. David Collins. The funding represents a fantastic achievement, so needed to help boost enterprise and our area in the west.

I have to hand a copy of a report of the Joint Committee on Autism on the summer programme for 2023.The report was passed at our public session earlier. It relates to changes we feel need to be made for the summer programme for 2023. The reality is that 36 out of the 130-odd special schools offered a school-based programme last year, which meant that only 14% of the children in our special schools got a school-based summer programme. We had situations where we had parents nearly advertising their kids online to try to get someone to do a home-based programme. The vast majority and a significantly high percentage did not get that programme and it is needed. We published this recommendation. I would ask that this would be debated prior to Christmas, if possible, in both the Dáil and the Seanad, because it is to be laid before both Houses. We need to discuss this now, with both Departments and with the Ministers of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion disability, Deputies Madigan and Rabbitte, respectively. We need these changes made in order to ensure that every child, and particularly the children with the highest level of need, get a school-based programme in 2023.

Fr. Ted Crilly was a great man for saying that money was resting in his account. I wish to make two brief points. First, I do not believe that mandatory sentences are the way to deal with violence against police. The people who go to jail on mandatory sentences will get six months or a year at Mountjoy and their life is ruined as a consequence. Financial penalties are sometimes far more effective than putting some young fellow into jail. Second, I refer to a certain type of case that has arisen in the past. I remember a case involving a Sinn Féin supporter called McIntyre who got substantial damages after being prosecuted for assaulting gardaí when he proved to a jury that he had been the victim of the assault. There has to be a fair approach to all of this. Sending people to jail on a kind of American basis where there is no hope for them and they have to go to jail is not the answer to the problem. Nobody is more supportive of the Garda than I am, but I just do not think it would achieve its stated purpose. On what was said about the motion in the names of Senator Boyhan, me and others, I do not think Senator Boyhan wants to deprive anybody of the opportunity of discussing the matter. If the Leader were to indicate that some time would be made available to discuss this issue at some point in the future where everybody in the House could have an opportunity to put their tuppence worth, we could arrive at a happy solution rather than put the matter to a vote.

#MarieSherlock	unknown-#MarieSherlock-party	unknown-#MarieSherlock-dob	unknown-#MarieSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	58	Every November we mark the gender pay gap in Ireland and across other European countries. The reality is that in Ireland, women workers on average earn almost a quarter less compared with their male counterparts. The latest available data is for 2020. We know that women, on average, earned 22% less on an annual basis. This is not the hourly basis that one often hears quoted; this is annual basis. Some 22% less is a shocking figure. That is in spite of significant growth in full-time female employment during the pandemic years of 2020 to 2022. We will see the legislation on gender pay gap reporting, which is very welcome, kicking in at the end of this year. However, it is important to note that is only one measure. Until we have proper collective bargaining rights in this country and proper transparency as to how jobs and promotions are advertised, we will not have any hope of trying to narrow that 22% figure. The other issue I just want to briefly reference is regarding the disgraceful scenes that we have seen in East Wall over the past few days. It is important to say that from talking to people in East Wall, because I live not that far from it, many are very hurt that the name of their area has been dragged through the mud and they are being depicted as racist and anti-immigrant.The reality could not be more different. There can be no excuse for protests. No matter what pressure there is on local services, there can never be an excuse to intimidate people or make them feel unwelcome. This is a co-ordinated effort on the part of certain individuals to try to rouse up a crowd outside of the old ESB building in East Wall. I support what Senators Hoey and Ruane spoke about earlier but it is important to say that there is an enormous strain in the north inner city, in that there is a massive shortage of services in health, education and early years services. The Government has to step up. As things are already under an enormous strain, the Government has to step up and put those services in place so that it does right by both the 380 individuals and families going into the old ESB building and everybody else in the community as well.

I am happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator O'Loughlin and I will take up her offer too. We will withdraw her amendment and I will come back and see if we can find time to debate it if that is okay with the Independent Group. One of the biggest topics that was raised is our support for An Garda Síochána. What we witnessed the other night is hard to understand and comprehend. What is even worse is it is not an isolated incident; these incidents are being presented to our gardaí week in and week out. That is not just happening in the areas we hear about on the television because there are bad apples in every single community and it is not fair to name Ballyfermot, Ballymun or any of the places we come from because there are bad apples in every barrel in every part of Ireland. I do not make the following point in any disrespectful way towards anybody who made contributions today or to any Minister, current or former. It is easy for us to stand up and say we support the Garda. We value our policing by consent because it makes for an Irish model. Irish society is changing, however, and I am not sure I can stand here and genuinely say I agree with the point about sentencing instead of fining. I am supportive of early intervention and providing services for children and young adults who might otherwise be led into certain types of lifestyles but we have an element of pure evil in our society that no amount of €1,000 or €5,000 fines will fix. I do not know what the answer is and I am not standing here saying I do but Senators will agree with me that the morale in the Garda is as low as I have ever seen it. When I was younger and we were getting work after school and college, a number of members of my family, as in all of our families probably, went into An Garda Síochána. We felt pride for them and we still do but I am sorry because I would not let any of my children consider being a garda today because their morale is so low and the conditions they are working under are so different to what they were before. We say we support them and yet we are doing little to show we support them.

A young man is in hospital today with staples and stitches in his head from being beaten with his own torch the other night. Two female gardaí who were in Cherry Orchard a couple of weeks ago have not gone back to work yet and there is no sign of them doing so. The Garda in Balbriggan is down nearly 10% on the quota of its employment figures because its members are sick and they cannot come to work. The stress they are working under is palpable and we need to do something about it and stop talking about it. That is my tuppence worth.

They are not unique and we have seen them in other parts of the country in recent years. Senator Ruane talked about how difficult it is to have those conversations with people you care about because there is a growing sense among people and not just those - and I do not know who they are except maybe two or three personalities who we know from the media - who we call the far right, as if there is some looming group over there. There are individuals but their sentiments are creeping into what we would call normal society. The responsibility on changing, challenging or fixing that has to be borne by all of us. I do not know how to have those conversations either, except, as Senator Ruane said, by doing so quietly with the people you love and care about. One must explain the point to them, no matter what their anger or issue is with the State or with a lack of services.Many communities have for many moons had difficulties and issues that need to be addressed. It is not the fault of the men who got off the bus in East Wall the other night, however, or the people who live in counties Sligo or Clare who have come to our shores because they flee circumstances that some of us maybe cannot even comprehend. While life is difficult in Ireland, it cannot be anything remotely as difficult as having to get on a boat or train to leave a country thousands of miles away. We all know the difficulties of some of those people who have come here. We need to challenge ourselves as to how we have that conversation to make sure the hospitality and heart we know Irish people have is maintained in our welcome. The other main issue today was raised by Senator Buttimer. I have always been a huge fan of football. Over the last number of years, we have seen both the power and the demise of FIFA as an organisation. We have seen how men who were giants in our eyes for donkeys years have been crumbled by corruption. What I saw this week, however, was one of the weakest organisations I have ever seen. What I really do not know or understand is why. We are all well aware of the horrendous reputation of Qatar. A figure of 85% of the people who live there are immigrants, and it is not by accident. It is absolutely by design. I really do not understand how smart people who are at the top of their game managing an international sport could have allowed what happened this week to happen. Even worse to my mind is that the entire world is looking on with this elephant in the room. While we all say it is disgraceful, it will still carry on. We still have play-offs, semi-finals and great matches and festivities. In the meantime, however, people are being marginalised because of who they are and we are doing nothing about it. One of our colleagues today spoke about the bravery of the Iranians who stood up for the people of their country yesterday. At the same time, we as a country are going to reopen our embassy in Teheran in the next couple of weeks. I really do not know what is going on in international communities when we think it is okay to reward people who have disgusting human rights records, which is exactly what we did with Qatar. Even on smaller levels, however, we all have a contribution to make. To my mind, opening our embassy in Teheran is absolutely despicable.

Is Bille tábhachtach é seo a sheachadann an gealltanas sa chlár don Rialtas an Bord Measúnaithe Díobhálacha Pearsanta a fheabhsú agus a athchóiriú. I acknowledge the co-operative support of Teachtaí Dála during their consideration of the Bill in the Lower House. Building on the positive engagement during pre-legislative scrutiny, I would particularly like to note the constructive engagement that I have had with Deputies Louise O’Reilly and Matt Shanahan and Senator Mullen. I acknowledge and pay tribute to the work undertaken by my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, in conceiving and developing this Bill. Deputy Troy's leadership in this area and his work with stakeholders in recent months has resulted in the Bill we are considering today. There is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy issues around the cost and availability of insurance. It needs sustained action across a range of policy areas. The programme for Government identified a range of issues that the Government is prioritising through the Cabinet subgroup on insurance reform chaired by the Tánaiste and delivering through the Action Plan on Insurance Reform. Good progress is being made with nearly 90% of the actions in the plan now delivered. Significant actions completed include the introduction of the new personal injuries guidelines, the enactment of legislation to strengthen the laws on perjury, and the establishment of the office to promote competition in the insurance market. Reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which we will discuss here today, is action 19 in the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. PIAB assesses claims for compensation arising from personal injuries sustained because of a motor, workplace or public liability incident. PIAB provides a fair and transparent assessment process in which personal injuries claims are resolved in a straightforward and efficient way. The model is a positive one for society because it delivers compensation more quickly with lower costs and predictable outcomes. The Central Bank published its Private Motor Insurance Report 4 last week. The report shows that from 2015 to 2021, the average settlement time for injury claims through PIAB was two years. This compared with 3.9 years through litigation. The report also shows that for the same period the average legal costs for private motor insurance claims under €100,000 settled via PIAB was €686 versus €15,567 for a litigated claim despite the average compensation being similar.The PIAB process is much more cost-effective and efficient. The benefits of the model are clear but we can and must do more to ensure claims are resolved in this way. The model can be strengthened to resolve a greater number of personal injury claims. This view is shared by a range of stakeholders. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, as amended in 2019, to increase the number of personal injury claims resolved by the board without recourse to litigation. The Bill will establish PIAB as a new and enhanced personal injuries resolution board. Central to this will be the introduction of mediation as a new service to resolve personal injury claims. The service offered by the board will follow the recognised principles of mediation, including being a fully voluntary process, ensuring confidentiality and impartiality and providing the opportunity for the parties to determine the issues that requiring resolving. Where the parties do not consent to mediation, the existing process in respect of assessment of a claim remains. An advantage of mediation is the ability for parties to get speedy access to a process that may produce a satisfactory and agreed outcome for them in a short space of time. Mediation is already successfully used by bodies such as the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman as a means of facilitating the resolution of issues between parties. My proposals are modelled on existing legislation in respect of those bodies. The Bill contains several amendments to enhance the role of the board regarding promotion of its work and its performance of data analysis and reporting. It allows for the retention of more complex cases, such as wholly psychological ones, by the board. The Bill provides for the issue of costs should a case proceed to litigation. The Government is also introducing a new provision to strengthen the process by making it an offence to provide false or misleading information to the board. This should strengthen and increase confidence in the process, which relies upon accurate and truthful information for its just and proper operation. I thank Senator Mullen for his contribution to this part of the Bill. Arising from discussion with Deputy Shanahan and Senator Crowe and engagement with stakeholders, I moved an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil to provide for a ministerial review of the new provisions contained in the Bill 18 months after commencement. This will provide an early opportunity to consider whether the new provisions, including those in respect of mediation, are working as intended. It is important to note that the reforms listed in the Bill, including the introduction of mediation, will not prolong cases. The board will remain obliged, under section 49 of the Act, to assess claims within nine months of confirmation of the respondent's consent to the assessment process, notwithstanding some exceptional circumstances provided for in the legislation. I will now summarise the main provisions of the Bill. Section 2 provides for the change of name of PIAB to the personal injuries resolution board to reflect its new functions. Section 3 sets out the application process to allow claimants to make an application for mediation, assessment or both and the mandatory elements thereof, including the requirement to supply a personal public service number or alternative identification. Sections 4 and 5 provide for the notification by the board of a claimant's application to the respondent, to ask whether the respondent consents to mediation, assessment or both and provision for the procedures to be followed by the board afterwards. Section 6 provides that where a respondent consents to mediation or assessment or both of a relevant claim or is deemed to consent to assessment, this will not be considered to be an admission of liability with regard to the relevant claim. Section 7 expands the types of claims that will be considered by the board by removing its discretion not to make an assessment for claims of a wholly psychological nature or where a long-term prognosis is not yet available. Section 8 extends the provisions relating to presumption of capacity of both the claimant and the respondent regarding the making of an assessment to include mediation. Section 9 introduces a new chapter 1A to the principal Act containing six sections, that is, sections 18A to 18F, inclusive, which introduce mediation as a new service to resolve claims under the board's process. This chapter details the mediation process and outlines how a mediation is completed. An unsuccessful mediation will move to assessment where a respondent has consented to same. Section 10 updates the reference in section 19 of the principal Act to provide for mediation. Section 11 provides that the board, with the consent of the Minister, may make regulations to impose charges in respect of its services. The section provides that where a respondent has failed to pay the relevant fee to the board in the required timeframe, the board can apply an additional administrative charge. Section 12 amends section 38 of the principal Act and sets out that where a monetary value has been agreed in mediation, the board will issue an order to pay. It provides for an order to pay to include any outstanding charges payable to the board by the respondent. Section 13 sets out the procedure to be followed where a claimant withdraws consent previously given to the board to retain a claim past the statutory timeframes set out in section 49 of the Act. Section 14 enables the board to retain claims where, based on a medical report, a long-term prognosis will not be available under the nine-month statutory timeframe. It provides for up to an extra two years, in addition to the nine months, for a long-term prognosis to become available. Section 15 provides that the extended time allowed for a long-term prognosis to become available, as provided for under section 14, will be included for the purposes of pausing the statute of limitations. This will be while claims are with the board and for a period of six months after it issues an authorisation. Section 16 is particularly noteworthy. Its purpose is to encourage greater acceptance of awards by the board, particularly as both the board and the courts must now assess personal injury claims under the personal injury guidelines. It sets out procedures for a claim that has left the board following an assessment, has been accepted by the respondent but rejected by the claimant, and has proceeded to litigation. Where a claimant brings proceedings in such circumstances, no award of costs may be made in his or her favour where the award does not exceed the board's assessment. The section also provides that the assessment value will be deemed to be an offer of tender of payment made by the defendant as of the date the respondent accepted or was deemed to have accepted the assessment. This serves to limit, in certain circumstances, the level of costs a respondent may have to pay up to the point of the acceptance date. Section 17 provides for four new functions to be accorded to the board. These are: one, to facilitate the resolution of claims through mediation; two, to collect and publish information relating to personal injury claims, including awards made under the personal injury guidelines; three, to conduct or commission research, analysis or studies on matters relating to the function of the board; and, four, to promote awareness of the role of the board and the benefits of resolving claims through it. Section 18 extends the requirement for certain persons to provide information to the board. Section 19 provides that mediators appointed from a panel will have the same indemnity for their work as will mediators who are members of staff of the board. Section 20 provides that the board may report suspected offences to An Garda Síochána. Section 21 provides that the board shall provide the Minister with information about the performance of its functions. Section 22 sets out that the provision of false or misleading information to the board by a claimant, respondent or third party is an offence. Section 23 provides that the amendments to the principal Act effected by the Bill will be reviewed by the Minister 18 months after commencement of the section. A report on the findings of the review and the conclusions drawn from those findings will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 24 provides for the exclusion of the mediation process from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. This is required as mediation is a confidential process. Section 25 provides the Short Title of the Bill and the citation and makes provision for enactment by statutory instrument. The Bill has been developed through extensive engagement with consumers, businesses, community groups and bodies such as the Alliance for Insurance Reform. The resounding message from all is the urgent need for reform. The Bill seeks to deliver that reform while respecting the fundamental right of access to our courts. The cost of claims is a large driver of insurance premiums. The Bill will increase the number of claims settled through an enhanced resolution process and reduce the cost of claims. This should and must impact positively on the cost of insurance, which is vital for many businesses and groups across our country. As acknowledged by the joint committee and as I know from recent meetings with stakeholders on the legislation, it is important that we now enact the Bill. I commend it to the House.

This is welcome legislation, which reflects a key commitment in the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance reform to enhance and reform the PIAB process. The data from the Central Bank report are clear. They show that prior to the introduction of reforms, it took twice as long for claimants to go down the legal route, compared with the PIAB process, and they ultimately ended up with a similarly sized settlement. From 2015 to the end of 2020, the average personal injury award for motor claims through PIAB was €22,000, compared with €23,000 through the courts. The key difference was that the legal cost of going through PIAB was €665, compared with €15,000, on average, through the courts. Furthermore, the implementation of the personal injury guidelines means there will be no difference between awards in courts and through the board. It is important that we continue to get that message out to people. I know from speaking to claimants that there is sometimes a perception that they are better off going down the legal route, which is simply not the case. Clearly, having more claimants settle at the PIAB stage is in everyone's interest. The Bill is aimed at further growing the percentage of such cases by making a number of enhancements to strengthen the board, as the Minister of State outlined. Insurance remains one of the major challenges facing businesses, particularly SMEs across the country. It is essential that we bring down its cost and increase competition in the sector. As the Minister of State said, there is no one reform that will suffice. Rather, there needs to be a wide range of complementary reforms to make a meaningful impact. A key pledge of Fianna Fáil before the most recent general election was to reform the insurance market. That is exactly what the Government is doing with the introduction of the personal injury guidelines, legislation to strengthen the law on perjury, the establishment of an office to promote competition in the market and the further strengthening of PIAB by way of this Bill. We have seen progress in attracting additional liability capacity into the Irish insurance market. We are now seeing additional insurance companies competing to provide cover for sectors that were uninsurable just a few years ago. PIAB data show average general claims have decreased by 44% under the personal injury guidelines, with the average PIAB award now €14,786, compared with €23,877 in 2020. We have also seen reductions in motor insurance. We need those reductions to become more widespread across the insurance sectors. SME owners in Galway tell me the cost of insurance has been a grave concern for them for a number of years. Unfortunately, it has even resulted in some having to close their business. That has been rare but it has happened. Now the Government has taken decisive action to address the issue, it is time for insurers to play their part and reflect those actions in the price of premiums. We also need greater transparency from insurance companies. Such transparency in respect of claims has been lacking for a long time. We must ensure that is no longer tolerated. An important consideration is the resourcing of PIAB. We have seen an increase in the number of cases coming before it, which is welcome. That is the way we want to go. The board appears to be dealing adequately with the increase but we all hope the number of cases it settles will continue to grow. Is the Minister of State confident the board has sufficient resources to handle such an increase or will it require greater resources? I welcome this legislation. It is another significant and substantial step in reforming the insurance sector, which the Government highlighted as a signature commitment. We are delivering on that commitment.

I welcome this legislation too. As far as I am concerned, it is important both that it should be passed and that it should be seen as part of a general reform of the law including, as Senator Crowe said, the guidelines, perjury legislation and so forth. A couple of things have occurred to me about this Bill. First, mediation is hugely important and should be encouraged at every stage. Second, way back in 2004, the then Minister, Mary Harney, introduced the original PIAB legislation, which I mirrored in the Department of Justice with the legislation that dealt with reforming the conduct of personal injuries litigation. One of the things that was brought in was a need for truthfulness in the litigation process to be made mandatory and to impose serious penalties of up to ten years imprisonment for people who fraudulently or dishonestly made claims. It does not make any sense to confine that to the court proceeding and to allow people to exaggerate their claims or mislead PIAB in safety. That does not make sense. Obviously, that aspect of this Bill is hugely important. I must say, and Senator Crowe put his finger on the issue, that the cost of insurance is still very high in this country. It is easy to complain about it but it is difficult to work out precisely how to deal with it. I feel that for all of the amendments that were made in 2004 and right up to now with the guidelines and all these very welcome steps that have been brought in, we still have very high insurance premiums. I wonder whether the insurance companies really are playing their part in rewarding people who have to insure against negligence with lower premiums. I do not think it is happening sufficiently. I will also say this about the whole question of reform in this area. It is one thing to control the amount of damages that are awarded to people and to try to bring rationality and uniformity to what should be given to somebody for a broken leg or who is paralyzed or has whiplash or the like. That is quantification of liability, if you like. I welcome the whole idea of judicial guidelines in that context. I do not see that it was in any way satisfactory in the past that the result of a case varied so widely depending on the personality of the judge. I say that without any criticism of any judge. However, some people were inclined to be more generous than others, full stop, and that applies to this very day. Therefore, the guidelines certainly have the effect, which they should, of increasing the role of PIAB. People will say that, in principle, this is the value of their claim so there is not much point seeking to litigate it if they are going to get more or less the same result from PIAB, the name of which will be changed to the Personal Injuries Resolution Board, PIRB, from now on. I ask a different question, however. I will raise it now although I know we will not resolve it this afternoon. Are we exacting too high a standard of care for huge areas of Irish society such as voluntary activities? Should it be that people who are running sports events or voluntary cultural events, for instance, are made liable to the same extent as somebody who is doing it for profit and who has the resources to comply with health and safety and such and has the organisation to deal with those issues? I find it sad in a way that voluntary activity is now withering in some areas because people simple cannot get the money together to pay insurance premiums for all sorts of things like agricultural shows, local horse shows, gymkhanas or whatever else. Even football clubs are affected, although I know the GAA tries to do this on a national basis. There are so many things affected; hunting, for example, insofar as it is allowable to say it anymore. I get the impression that even to bring people out on pony trekking is now a very dangerous thing to do in terms of insurance and insurance premiums. People are running away from those kinds of activities. The flip side of that coin is that we must acknowledge that a fair amount of risk is involved in sporting activity. If people are going to attend an event organised by their local community, should they really be in a position to start a legal action if they trip over something, somebody bumps into them or if there is inadequate supervision or whatever else? Should people be in the same position to sue in that instance as they would be when going into a cinema or something like that where the owner of the cinema knows the standard that must be maintained? How can that issue be dealt with? There should be a higher onus of proof on the plaintiff in respect of some areas of voluntary activity before damages can be awarded in the first place. I would suggest that in some areas, gross negligence should be required to be proven before a relationship of care exists at all. When a person walks down the street nowadays, the road traffic law is interesting in that if a pothole appears due to wear and tear, a person cannot sue if he or she trips in it, but he or she can sue if it can be proven that it was caused by a negligent repair. That kind of artificial distinction underlines the artificiality of effectively creating a society in which nobody takes any risk themselves. If people can find any fault on the part of somebody else, they can sue. I will throw that out for consideration. It is perhaps for another day. I welcome this legislation.

I compliment him, his staff and all in the Department on the work they have put into this. I held a public meeting on insurance with the Tánaiste in the past and addressed the issue of insurance reform in a number of other organisations. Some of the revelations by not only small businesses but big businesses were absolutely frightening. I welcome the fact that this Bill is coming forward. Senator Crowe referred to small as well as large businesses. The cost of insurance has in many cases gone absolutely through the roof. Even going back to Covid-19, while they were not small injuries claims, many people took businesses to court for things like asking them to wear a mask. People actually took businesses to court and got money out of them. It really is not acceptable. When we were going through Covid-19 in very difficult times, businesses had signs up very clearly asking people to please wear their masks. Many claims were coming through at the time that possibly were not warranted. To follow on from what Senator McDowell said, we are very lucky that we have had an ice-skating rink in Limerick for the last 20-odd years.I see the one in Galway is not operating this year because of the high cost of insurance. Things like that really resonate with businesses. My understanding is the business in Galway employed 25 people, and while it was seasonal for six or eight weeks, 25 people had jobs for the duration. I understand the quote for insurance was somewhere in the region of €50,000 to €60,000 a week, although it did not have any proven personal injury claims against it. That is my understanding of the situation. While there are people who take claims and genuinely deserve the money, others take claims that are not always warranted. The Bill goes a long way. The Minister of State has engaged with the Alliance for Insurance Reform and small and large businesses. It is also most welcome that the Bill went through pre-legislative scrutiny at the committee. People had the opportunity to make submissions. The Bill strengthens the remit of the board and puts it on a stronger standing. I picked out a few points that I believe are strong measures. These are: "to facilitate the resolution of claims through mediation ... to collect and publish information relating to personal injury claims, including awards made under the personal injury guidelines ... to conduct or commission research, analysis or studies on matters relating to the function of the board; and ... to promote awareness of the role of the board and the benefits of resolving claims through it". These four points are very important. Senator McDowell referred to the setting up of PIAB. I am aware of the amount of work the former Minister, Ms Harney, put into it. Although it was working, the Bill has made it even stronger. It is going to help many small businesses and people to get their cases resolved quickly. It often took cases many years to go through the courts. While I am not a legal person, I have worked with people who have had claims and they were taking far too long. I believe that cases must be concluded within a specified amount of time. The strength of the board is being increased. Mediators now have a very important role to play. In many cases, bringing in a mediator to work with the person being claimed against and the claimant often helps to bring the two sides together and to bring sense to the situation. I welcome that the Minister of State has had extensive engagement with the consumer. I compliment all involved in the Bill and I look forward to working with the Minister of State in the future. I also welcome his commitment to review the working of the Bill in 12 or 18 months.

On behalf of Sinn Féin, I welcome the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, as it relates to the programme for Government commitment to enhance and reform PIAB. It also addresses the commitments in the action plan for insurance reform to provide for a new and enhanced personal injuries resolution board. Overall, this Bill is a positive step in the reform of the claims landscape, and it follows the adoption of the personal injuries guidelines in 2021. Anyone who talks about insurance will know that my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, has done tremendous work in this area over the past decade. Therefore Sinn Féin supports this Bill, and any movement to reduce the cost of claims, speed up the process and, accordingly, reduce insurance premiums is to be welcomed. The Bill proposes to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019, which would have the effect of increasing the number of personal injury claims settled through PIAB, which it is hoped would help avoid the expense and time associated with litigation. The objective of the Bill is to amend the legislation to facilitate an increase in the level of personal injury claims that may be resolved through the board. This Bill also introduces the option of mediation, whereby both parties would be asked to consent to mediation and, if mutually agreeable, a mediation officer is then appointed. The recruitment of mediation officers will be very important. They need to be the right people with the right experience. Their contract terms and conditions will be very important because not only do we want them to start the work and for there to be enough officers recruited to prevent a backlog, but we also want them to feel they can work in that position on a long-term basis. Anyone who works in mediation knows that one builds up the knowledge and understanding of the issues over time, which is invaluable in providing an excellent and efficient service. The Bill further seeks to extend the powers of PIAB to assess more complex injuries, such as psychological injuries, which were not previously assessed by PIAB. In doing that, it aims to increase the number of personal injury claims that can be resolved by including these types of claims. Avoiding unnecessary litigation is the key purpose of PIAB and the Bill before us. Assessing insurance claims through PIAB is a quicker and cheaper option through which to make insurance claims. In 2020, it was estimated the cost of litigation was €16,064, but if done through PIAB the average cost is €841. That is very significant. Furthermore, the amount of time to settle reduces on average from 4.2 years through litigation to 2.3 years through PIAB. We know the long drawn out process of litigation can be very stressful for claimants, so this is also good news. Litigation and personal injury claims increase the cost of solicitors and barristers as well as the insurance industry. The costs associated with litigation are then used as an excuse to inflate premiums disproportionately. Sinn Féin has consistently advocated for the strengthening of the powers of PIAB as a method of reducing the legal costs in claims settlements. PIAB has shown itself to be successful when self-financing, but it is important it continues to have the resources it needs to improve its performance and the volume of disputes it can assess. The reduced cost of litigation due to the recent changes in legislation and the financial benefits insurance companies will gain from an enhanced PIAB role must be passed on to consumers. There is not much evidence of that as yet since the introduction of the 2021 guidelines. The Government must monitor this carefully. Sinn Féin's insurance Bill, introduced by Deputy Doherty, requires just this, namely, the publishing of a report on the effects of the previously introduced guidelines and that consideration would be given to the report when framing future legislation. Many local community groups struggle with insurance costs, and now with rising inflation and energy costs they will struggle even more. Insurance costs are usually the biggest barrier for these groups when trying to organise events such as local festivals or fun days. The Alliance for Insurance Reform recently carried out a policyholders survey to mark the first anniversary of the implementation of the pivotal judicial guidelines for personal injury damages on 24 April 2021. This survey found that 42% of respondents believe insurance costs are threatening the future of their organisation. This figure is not materially different from the response to the same question in research the alliance carried out in 2018. It also found that 31% say insurance costs are preventing them from providing certain services, which has increased from 26% in the 2018 survey. In stark contrast, however, PIAB reported that the average awards for personal injury claims made since the introduction of the personal injuries guidelines are down by 42% compared with 2020. This shows that strong action in the area of insurance can have a beneficial effect, but we must see those benefits passed on to insurance customers.
#MarieSherlock	unknown-#MarieSherlock-party	unknown-#MarieSherlock-dob	unknown-#MarieSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	82	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I apologise in advance as I must leave this debate after making my contribution. We very much welcome the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022. All in this House are extremely conscious of the unacceptable situation that pertains to the insurance sector in this country. There is a very real problem with unaffordable premiums, and insurance firms have failed to pass on reductions. We heard other speakers talk about the fact that although the judicial guidelines have been in place for some time, we have yet to see a substantial drop in premiums. We also have a dysfunctional market.There are swaths of community groups – Senator McDowell talked about this earlier – that simply cannot secure insurance in this country anymore and are consequently put out of business. There may be but one insurance provider, if any, in the UK or beyond. These are all issues that will not necessarily be dealt with in this Bill. Nonetheless, we very much support the Bill in the hope it will lower the cost of insurance claims and reduce premiums over the medium term. One of the key recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am a member, is that the Bill be proceeded with as quickly as possible in terms of the overall insurance reform agenda. I want to touch on some of the concerns. The clear positives associated with the legislation have been already articulated but I want to raise some questions and concerns regarding it. The first relates to the work of the proposed mediation service, specifically its separation from the board's assessment work. At hearings of the joint committee, we heard of the need to put clear water between the mediation and assessment processes so officials involved in mediation will not be involved in assessment. However, subsections 18(d), (e) and (f), which cover the establishment of the mediation service, only require that the mediator not be involved in the assessment, or vice versa. I am conscious that there are powers delegated to the board in section 18(f) but it is not clear why clear blue water would not be put between both distinct services in the new PIRB. Arguably, there are different skill sets. I am conscious that barristers undertake both assessment and mediation the whole time, but, for consistency of assessment, it is crucial that a set number of individuals undertake the assessment work and that this work is separate from the mediation work. We heard during pre-legislative scrutiny that this would be considered. I am probably not sufficiently reassured by the text of the Bill that we are going to have the clear water between both processes. The second issue I want to raise concerns the right to bring legal advice with an individual party to the mediation process. The availability of mediation is very welcome but typically that process involves an insurer versus an individual. There is an immediate power imbalance in that arrangement from the get-go. Once one side is lawyered up and the other is not, it reinforces the imbalance of power. Section 18(b) sets out the role of the mediator but we need to see much stronger provisions on the responsibility of the mediator towards the individual or claimant in particular. Notwithstanding that participation in mediation by the parties is voluntary, I am concerned that individuals would feel in some way implicitly coerced into participating in mediation as opposed to going straight through to the assessment. I would like to see a stronger role for the mediator with regard to a duty of care towards the claimant. The last point I would like to make is on data collection. A lot of data are being collected at present but a key issue concerns the cases that go to PIAB that end up in the Circuit Court. I am not sure we have a full handle on the cases that progress and where PIAB fails to fully and finally resolve the claimant question. We need to understand much more about the throughput from the new PIRB, when established, to the court system. Ultimately, it is only when we see a reduction in the number going on to the courts and cases fully and finally resolved within the PIRB that we will know it has been a success. Some of the evidence concerning PIAB indicates that cases have just gone straight to the courts.

I join them in acknowledging the work of PIAB since its inception in 2004. In this regard, I acknowledge the role of Senator McDowell and former Tánaiste Mary Harney, but also, particularly in the year the relevant legislation was passed, former Minister of State Noel Treacy, who was an advocate of the board and its work. PIAB, as we all agree, reduces unnecessary litigation, making it easier, quicker and cheaper to resolve claims for everyone involved in the process. It is completely impartial and fair in making award assessments. The result is of benefit to the person injured, the person or company the claim is against and society as a whole. PIAB works – we are all agreed on that – and we want it to do more. This Bill will enable that. To speak to Senator Crowe's concerns about PIAB resources, I visited the board last Thursday. It is absolutely gearing up for the extra work. Its chairperson and team, who are in Tallaght, are looking forward to taking on the work. They are implementing a new IT system and are very realistic about what work will be involved in planning for it. Our officials continue to engage with them to ensure the new arrangement will work. I endorse all the comments made today reflecting the issues that still arise regarding the cost and availability of insurance. Considerable work has been done on insurance since the inception of this Government. I have outlined the work done through the insurance action plan and by the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming. It is now vital that the benefits of all that work is passed on to customers. Senator McDowell's remarks were interesting in this regard. He alluded to what we need to do and what further changes need to be made in this space. It is unacceptable that voluntary effort, community effort, community engagement and events to bring communities together are impaired or suffering because of insurance issues. The differentiation the Senator made is interesting and definitely worth proceeding with. On Senator Sherlock's remarks on the assessment and mediation, there will be a separation of functions. Subsection 18(e) lays that out in detail. PIAB will make the rules on how the roles of mediation and assessment will be differentiated and on how independence will be maintained. That will be done in accordance with established principles laid out on mediation, and the provisions for claimants and information will be laid out clearly. That is also being discussed with PIAB as part of its work programme related to the introduction of this Bill. This is a very significant Bill. I acknowledge everybody who has played a part in producing it. The review process is important. We need to make sure it is working and has the required impact. This is not the end of the chapter, however. Until we see in public and employer liability insurance the kinds of reductions we are beginning to see in motor insurance, we cannot take our foot off the pedal regarding insurance reform. I assure all the Senators that this work will continue throughout the lifetime of the Government.  Gabhaim buíochas le gach duine sa Teach as a ráitis inniu. I thank my officials, particularly Mr. John Maher and Ms Anne Barrett, who are present and have lived with this Bill for some time. They have put enormous work into it. We look forward to Committee Stage and to passing it in this House.

We have already said the thresholds are a departure from the trends across Europe and in the North and we are diverging somewhat from those. We are expressing our concerns in respect of the appropriateness of the thresholds and asking the Minister of State to clarify his position in order that the record will show it for evermore. My understanding was that the Minister of State had to leave and that the discussion was left there.

On the previous occasion, we left the debate at the point where we asked the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to clearly set out the rationale for the thresholds.

We wanted to clearly hear, for the public record, reassurances as to why we are deciding to go for these thresholds, which, as I said, are out of kilter with those in countries that have similar levels of rainfall. That is where we left matters and that is why we asked for the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to come in and clarify the point.

The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, explained his position. However, it is a position that I would not agree with. As a result, my request was that the Minister of State and the officials take a look at this level and see if 25 cu. m is too high, given that 10 cu. m is the level that is used in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, which would have similar topography. We clearly have an issue with abstractions so my request was for the Minister of State to see if something could be done on Report Stage by the Government. I was asked by the chair of the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Matthews, to raise this issue. I know he will bring it up at that committee and on Committee Stage in the Dáil as well. I wanted to make sure that was put on the record. To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, came back in, but it was not exactly what we wanted to hear, and that is the point.

This would be captured as part of the regular water framework directive monitoring, with sophisticated flow modelling and field investigations by local authorities' water programmes. The registration threshold is sufficient to capture over 99% of the volume of water abstracted in Ireland, thereby minimising value risks from over-abstraction. As I understand it, Deputy Matthews is going to raise this matter separately at the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage. That is a good place to discuss the matter further.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is picking up on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, well. I will set the scene as the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is new to the brief for this section of the Bill. I undertook to table nine amendments on behalf of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA. These amendments were not written by me; they were written by the IFA. I know the IFA relies on its own research, but it also has its own bureau which advises it well. I add that none of these amendments have been ruled out of order, which is an interesting point. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine and am also a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as I was reminded. However, I did not need to be reminded; I believe I made that remark in my opening comments before anyone else spoke. There is always a challenge during pre-legislative scrutiny. While it is very informative and important, it is not where the legislation is made. I am usually a great advocate of taking as much detail as possible from the pre-legislative scrutiny into the legislative process. However, I have considered these amendments and I believe in bringing different ideas, perspectives and opinions to the table and at least discussing them and teasing them out. The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and will subsequently go to the Dáil, which has a bigger political scope and bigger political groupings allowing it to tease it out in more detail. The Dáil may change many of the things that we may or may not decide to do in this House. I want to set out the rationale for the amendment. The IFA has requested that the paragraph be included on account of animal welfare. The current legislation does not allow for an exemption on these grounds. Besides water availability, the quality of water has a direct impact on the welfare of animals. Therefore, livestock need to drink more water under heat stress and when forage conditions are poor. Overall, the IFA believes we need to do more to ensure the animal welfare can be protected in order that we can provide the highest quality produce to Irish customers and our trading partners. That is the rationale for this amendment. I could go on at great length but it is not my intention. I want this to be a meaningful engagement. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.

A permanent and foreseen abstraction for the purposes of animal welfare concerns, which is above the registration threshold, should be placed on the register. The amendment is not accepted as section 9(3)(b) of the Bill provides for an exemption for temporary abstraction to facilitate the carrying out of works. These works are not specified and could be interpreted to include the provision of temporary drinking water troughs for animals.

That is the tricky part. Any abstraction over 10 cu. m should be registered so that we know what it is. Part of this is a fact-finding mission and at times when there is an issue with water levels, it enables us to get back to everybody on the register. I do not see anything here that would interfere with animal health and welfare at all. In fact, it would have the opposite effect and allow us to manage our water better. I again note that the recommendation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which Senator Boyhan mentioned, is for that lower level of registration for water abstraction.

The scope of the exemptions that would potentially be permitted by regulations made under this section is strictly limited and these activities are listed in section 9. No specific organisations are deemed exempt from any requirements. The broad criteria or matters to which the Minister must have regard when making regulations to allow for exemptions are listed in the section and include: the environmental objectives of the water body concerned, and the requirements of the birds, habitats and environmental impact assessment, EIA, directives. The Minister will be required to consult with and consider the opinion of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, when making any regulations under this section.

Removing this section would weaken the EPA's capacity to ensure that appropriate regulation and protection of the environment is in place. Therefore, I cannot accept its removal.

For example, section 5(3) of the amended annex IV to the EIA directive does not seem to be included. This is the section that refers to the accumulation of effects with other existing and-or approved projects, taking into account existing environmental problems relating to areas of particular environmental importance likely to be affected or the use of natural resources. Why is there no explicit reference in section 23 to the need to include all of the relevant information outlined in annex IV of the EIA directive? Why has there been a picking and choosing of which parts of annex IV get listed in section 23 instead of including all of the relevant information?

In some cases, these breaches will be minor and amenable to simple rectification through the standard enforcement actions. It should be noted that this will include large bodies, in particular Irish Water, which, by the nature of its work as well as the scale and scope of that work, has breached the conditions of its existing licences, such as the wastewater discharge licences. These breaches will have been met with enforcement action from the EPA and should not preclude Irish Water from holding another licence or authorisation in all cases.

This insertion is required to ensure the protection of the environment as well as the conditions of existing licences reliant on a given associated impoundment. Subsection (5) requires that, in cases where the impoundment being relied on for the purpose of a joint licence is the subject of an existing licence, the new joint licence will not alter the impoundment in a way that could cause a water body to fail to meet its environmental objectives or affect the continued operation of the impoundment as it relates to the existing licence. In other words, the conditions of a new joint licence cannot result in a contravention of the conditions of an existing licence. With these amendments included, the requirements under this section that relate to a joint licence for abstraction and associated impoundment will apply regardless of whether the associated impoundment was previously subject to another joint licence.

I wish to flag to Senators who might be listening that I will be calling a vote on this matter. The IFA states that subparagraphs (a) to (e), inclusive, undermine the legal rights of farmers and could have a negative effect on land and property values.Section 61(2)(d) and (e) are problematic in terms of the powers they give Irish Water, and they should therefore be deleted. Reservoirs of water on farms often serve a specific purpose. Irish farmers should be free to determine what they want to do on their property. We should remember we have constitutional rights to private property. At a minimum, Irish Water should be required to seek permission from the farmers or the landowners. That is important. I accept the purpose of the water reservoir on the farm also needs to be accounted for before any auxiliary work can be done on the farm or the water courses on that farm. If there are possible workarounds that would not cause disruption to farmers, they should be explored. It is critically important for a number of reasons. I have taken advice on it and I have met with a number of people who have sought legal opinion on the matter. I believe it will become contentious in the future, so it is only right and proper we indicate that here and now. This is a very important amendment. I await the Minister of State's response.

Furthermore, the exercise of these powers is subject to an objections procedure provided for in sections 64 to 68, inclusive, and the compensation provisions in sections 69, 72 and 82. The objections procedure will allow any person to challenge the powers of Irish Water to exercise its right to carry out a public abstraction. On these grounds, I cannot accept the amendment.

Any claim for compensation under this section can be made only after the abstraction has commenced. Any person who believes he or she may be entitled to compensation has the duration of the licence application process, plus the additional 52 weeks provided in section 69, to determine if there has been a material impact on their rights, title or interests in respect of water. This is considered ample time to determine if there has been a material impact and the scale of that impact. Subsection 69(3) also allows for potential extension of this period on application to the High Court where there is good and sufficient reason for doing so and the circumstances that resulted in the failure to bring the claim within 52 weeks were beyond the person's control. These compensation provisions are considered both comprehensive and fair and, in that regard, this amendment is not accepted.

While this legislation allows farmers to seek compensation, it would require protracted arbitration and potential challenges in the courts. I touched on that earlier. The 52-week period needs to be changed and should be aligned to the Statute of Limitations for six years. Failure to ensure that it aligns with the Statute of Limitations means that a person may not be able to seek full compensation. It is also possible that any environmental damage may not be apparent for months or even years. In short, six months is too short a timeframe to receive a satisfactory compensation package.

There is no need for the development of a national compensation claims protocol related to material impacts arising from public abstractions. During the development of the Bill, due consideration was given to all potential compensation claims that could arise as a result of abstractions undertaken in accordance with this legislation. I am confident that the provisions in the Bill are more than suitable for any circumstance related to abstractions. In that regard I do not accept the amendment.

This will allow the Minister to directly notify those persons of the order once made at the same time as notifying Irish Water and the agency.

Regarding amendment No. 22 and section 96(1)(c), "exercise all or any of the powers" is the correct phrase given section 95, the section referenced, provides for the powers of authorised persons rather than their functions. Amendment No. 23, to the chapeau of section 96(2), will correct a clerical error whereby reference should be to the exercise of the powers of the authorised person in general under Part 9 regarding enforcement, rather than specifically to those powers included in section 96. The purpose of the subsection is to allow an authorised person to apply to the District Court for a warrant to enter premises in the specific circumstances provided for in this section.
