#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	Across the country, families have applied for the home help service for elderly relatives to keep them in their own homes. However, they are receiving letters stating that while the hours are approved, no funding is available to allocate extra resources. It seems ludicrous that the HSE is sending out letters approving home help hours, yet it does not have resources to back them up. The home help system is a fantastic service which allows people to stay in their own homes, and it encourages them to do so. However, a cost-benefit analysis of that service does not seem to have been undertaken. Such an analysis would show how much could be saved by allocating a proper care package and home help service for patients. For example, it would save the costs involved in providing long-term care in nursing homes.  Last year, the HSE estimated that 2.2 million extra home help hours would be needed to accommodate the requirements arising from demographic changes in 2016. Unfortunately, there was nothing in either the HSE's plans or the budget to allocate funding for those home help hours. On the one hand, the HSE says it is necessary to have these hours in place to accommodate people in their own homes, while, on the other, the Government has not put funding in place for them. That is ludicrous.  The current programme for Government included increased funding for home help and home care packages. The last programme for Government, from 2011 to 2016, had a similar provision albeit with different wording, yet nothing has been done about it. Does the Minister accept that there is a crisis concerning home help and home care packages? We are getting reports that the HSE is dealing with this matter in different ways in various areas. The HSE says it must wait until somebody ceases looking for home help, or dies, before somebody else can be accommodated through that availability.  Is the Minister aware that it is taking six months to process applications for the carer's allowance? Is he also aware that it can take four or five months to process the simplest medical card application? Reports by advocacy services, including Age Action Ireland and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, state that there is a crisis out there. Is the Minister aware of this? What is on the Government's agenda to tackle this crisis?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	I thank Deputy Michael Moynihan for raising this issue. Members of the House will appreciate the importance of community-based care. Yesterday, an announcement was made concerning additional funding for the health service which, significantly, includes additional provision for home help hours. It is also important to bear in mind, as the Deputy has recognised, that the programme for Government contains a commitment to increase home help hours every year. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, will shortly publish the demographic impact on spending in each area. No doubt the demographic impact on health will include provision, built into the 2017 no-policy-change budget, to deal with the demographic pressures to which the Deputy has referred. Yesterday, the Taoiseach adverted to the fact that currently there is a 4% annual increase in the number of people over 85. That clearly creates pressure on areas such as the home help service. As regards having uniformity across the country, home help has always been organised on a decentralised model. Part of its strength is that local home help organisers understand their community. It has, therefore, been organised in a way that seeks to respond flexibly to local needs. That balance between uniform provision, national planning, diversity and division is part of the service's strength. It is not something we would want to let go of lightly.  The Deputy mentioned delays in issuing the carer's allowance, which has been a problem for as long as I have been in politics. It concerns the complexity of the assessment methods which the Oireachtas has put in place.It requires capital and income assessments as well as a medical assessment. That has been put in place, in the wisdom of the Oireachtas, as a fair way of allocating it, but it does create delays in assessment, which are inevitable with that type of approach. There is also the carer's benefit for people who are at work and decide to take a break to provide care. That can be a bridge because it is based on stamps and does not require the same detailed assessment. I will alert the Minister for Health to the Deputy's concerns. The Minister for Social Protection has responsibility for carer's allowance, but I will alert the Minister for Health about the continuing problems the Deputy mentioned with medical card delays. I have experienced some improvement in that regard. Members of the last Dáil travelled out there to see that improved processes were put in place.

As Members of the Oireachtas, we are challenged to change that. If there is a system in place that is bureaucratic and is causing undue hardship for families, we are duty-bound to challenge it and ensure it is changed. Does the Government accept that the home help and home care packages, by any standard of cost-benefit analysis, provide a fantastic service to older people and families and save the State a vast amount of money? I ask the Minister to do whatever is required with the carer's allowance and medical cards. With regard to the carer's allowance, it is unacceptable that when a medical report is sent to the Department it can take six to eight weeks for it to be accepted, when any layperson can see that the person concerned is in need of full-time care and attention. It is not acceptable to say that it is the system. We must change that system, because families are under savage pressure to keep elderly relatives at home for as long as possible.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	7	I do not disagree with the Deputy. Much of the effort of the Oireachtas has gone towards recognising that. As the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, reminded me, last year we restored the respite care grant to its full value and we have sought to improve home help and home care packages. In each of the winter initiatives, a substantial improvement in spending on home care occurs. I agree with the Deputy that we must try to keep as many people as possible living independently in their homes. I noted from the reports during the week that perhaps we have not emphasised that sufficiently and that there has been too much emphasis on institutional care in cases in which people could have remained independent. The programme for Government reflects that concern and commits to expanding this area. We have made a very solid commitment in this regard, even though we are aware that new drugs coming on the market or new procedures will demand attention and resources. There is a recognition in the programme for Government of the importance of this area of care.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	The Private Residential Tenancies Board has confirmed that the cost of renting continues to spiral out of control. At the end of May, the average cost of renting a home in Dublin was €1,454 per month, which is a staggering €17,500 per year. That is higher than the highest point reached in 2007. Outside Dublin, while rents are below the 2007 peak, they are still rising. I believe we can agree that these rents are scandalous. Due to the failure of previous Governments to ensure an adequate supply of social and affordable housing, more people are finding themselves reliant on - indeed, trapped in - the private rental sector. How is a low-income family expected to keep pace with such rents? How are working families expected to pay these rents and save for a deposit on their own homes at the same time? A report from the Homeless Agency shows that spiralling rents is one of the principal causes of family homelessness. Scores of families will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight because they cannot afford their rent. Across the State, rent supplement and housing assistance payments lag considerably behind market rents. Last year, the former Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, were locked in a bitter row over how to deal with rising rents. The Government set its face against rent certainty. It refused to link rents to the consumer price index. Instead, it introduced measures which not only have not worked, but have made matters worse. The Committee on Housing and Homelessness has received repeated and strong calls in its hearings and submissions for the introduction of rent certainty and for increases in rent supplement and housing assistance payment levels. Will the Government include rent certainty in its action plan on housing which is to be published in August? Second, will the Government ensure there are increases in rent supplement and housing assistance payments to ensure that no family is made homeless due to an inability to pay its rent?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It is no secret that the crisis in housing is the biggest issue on the Government's agenda. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has committed to an action plan for housing within the first 100 days. He has consulted widely with all of the interests, including those referred to by the Deputy, in the preparation of that work. The Committee on Housing and Homelessness is due to report soon with its input into this debate. In terms of the response, many worthwhile initiatives have been put in place in the past, although obviously more must be done. I agree with the Deputy that there is inadequate supply of both social and private housing. Much of the rental sector is in the private sector, and the rents the Deputy referred to in the reports are entirely in the private sector. This is a supply issue and we must see an acceleration of supply both in the social housing programme and in the private sector. That will be a big feature of what emerges from this. There is also the issue of the adequacy of rent supplement. The Department of Social Protection has a protocol in place under which 1,000 families have been assisted in getting higher rent supplement with a higher ceiling to avoid the pressures the Deputy has described. With regard to the housing assistance payment, a 50% uplift of the payment is being piloted in Dublin and that is making an impact for families who are threatened with becoming homeless. It is working in some cases but, obviously, there will have to be a tight review to assess its impact. This area is getting a huge level of Government attention. There have already been four or five meetings of the Cabinet committee on housing at which all of the issues are being raised. Rent certainty was dealt with in a Bill that was passed by the Oireachtas, under which new rules governing rent certainty have been provided. They provide for a more extended period of notice and there can only be increases in rents every two years. Those provisions are in place and will be monitored in terms of policy in this area.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	The Minister is correct that it is no secret that there is a crisis in housing. It is equally no secret that this is a Government-made crisis. It is also no secret that it took a considerable amount of time for the Government to catch up and recognise the scale of the crisis. It is no surprise that the Minister has not answered my questions, so I will put them again. Will the action plan on housing contain a commitment to rent certainty and increases in rent supplement and housing assistance payments? The Committee on Housing and Homelessness has met. It is a cross-party committee and it received reams of submissions from experts across the board. I seek a commitment from the Minister today that rent certainty and increases in the rent supplement and housing assistance payments will be contained in the action plan. Should the committee in its final report recommend rent certainty, a link to the consumer price index and increases in those payments, will the Government honour the report, listen to the committee and ensure the recommendations are included in the action plan?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	In respect of what has caused the housing crisis, it is important to remember that misplaced policies caused a construction boom of unprecedented levels where we built 90,000 houses and had a massive property bubble. This bubble collapsed with all the ensuing consequences, such as the damage to people's lives and the public finances. We have been living with that ever since and no system is more broken than that relating to housing provision. The system is simply broken and must be rebuilt from scratch. The Minister will look at all views coming from all parties. The housing action plan has not yet come to Government for consideration so I have not seen the elements of it. The committee's recommendations have not yet to come to Government. The Deputy can rest assured that the Government will look at all elements. The rent issue is about supply. We have inadequate supply and that is what the report today showed. It showed that the number of properties becoming available for rental has declined at a time when there is an increase in demand. This has simply put pressure on rents and that imbalance must be corrected before we resolve this crisis.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	12	Last week, together with my Labour colleague, Joe Costello, I held a series of meetings in Dublin north's inner city with community leaders, business owners, educators, service providers and members of An Garda Síochána. As everybody in the House knows, the spotlight is on the north inner city because of gun deaths and the focus on crime. This is a cause of great frustration for the people who live there who are weary of the periodic focus on their community and the analysis and talk relating to it. They were anxious that they now be fully involved in finding a permanent solution to which everybody can buy in. Two weeks ago, I raised the issue of a joint task force with the Taoiseach. In response to my query, he indicated that this would happen. I have a few questions for the Minister. Where stands the task force? Who will lead it? The latter is one of the issues that was raised again and again with me. It is critical that the local community be fully involved in the design of a solution to all the issues of inequality that prevail in the north inner city. It could be a model for regeneration and a model of hope. However, it can only work on the basis that all of us across the various parties - in or out of government and regardless of the vagaries of politics and how the political winds blow over the next decade - commit to signing a solemn pledge, individually as Members of this House, to implement the blueprint for action outlined by this task force. On behalf of the Government and Fine Gael, will the Minister commit to signing such a pledge for this community, which could become a model for other areas in regeneration, rebuilding and supplanting despair with hope? Will he also answer the questions relating to the timescale and membership of the task force that the Taoiseach agreed to create?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	13	I do not have precise answers in respect of the timeframe but I assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach is taking this very seriously. Within the education portfolio, I am looking at areas where we could support initiatives within the north inner city and also, as the Deputy says, in the context of a wider model to examine areas of concentrated disadvantage to see how we can break that cycle. The concept of working across Departments has come into vogue in the past couple of years. Examples include the Action Plan for Jobs and the action plan for housing. The Deputy is right in that we need to form an approach to dealing with concentrated urban deprivation in particular in a way that is more consistent and breaks away from silos because an individual family deals with all the problems. It does not silo its problems between health, education, the community, the risk of slipping into lives of crime and all the other aspects. The Taoiseach is continuing to work with this and I am sure he will communicate with the Deputy. The question of whether such an approach can become something we would roll out and create a pledge around is a challenge for this Dáil. One of the things we need to do is have a long-term vision. We are approaching a long-term vision for health and looking to the Oireachtas to have a degree of consensus about that. We want to do the same in terms of long-term funding for the higher education system where there will also be a challenge coming down the track. Climate change is a third issue. There is a large number of major challenges facing this Oireachtas and I agree with the Deputy that this certainly ranks among them. We need to find a more consistent way of ensuring that the resources of the State are deployed in a way that delivers better outcomes in these communities rather than each sitting within its own silo. Today, we have seen the publication of a report on the health prospects of people suffering from cancer in different parts of our community. The report again raises questions for the Oireachtas as to how it can improve delivery in these areas. While it would be premature for me to say I will sign on the dotted line for a policy approach we have yet to see fully developed, I am fully behind the spirit of what the Deputy is saying. In respect of my responsibilities in education, I would like to see that sort of cross-community approach because a school cannot be just an oasis on its own. Its strength depends on the resources it can bring in from the rest of the community in order to deliver improvements. I look forward to the work of the task force and I will ask the Taoiseach to communicate to the Deputy on the framework and how the Oireachtas will be fully involved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	14	I welcome the Minister's initial positive view of the all-party pledge in respect of this. The Minister said that this is a challenge for the Dáil. It is more than a challenge. It is imperative that we do not just talk about an area that has been in the public view periodically for decades, but actually commit ourselves to finding a resolution. We can do that. All of us, and I put my hand up, have failed this community. We have failed it because we have not delivered the resources in a consistent, co-ordinated, marshalled and ongoing way that would break the cycle of deprivation that has led not only to elements of crime, but an ongoing lack of participation in proper health statistics. I ask the Minister to ensure that we have a clear timeframe for this task force, that the membership will be set out - he can come back to me on that - that there will be real community buy-in and that we, as an Oireachtas, commit ourselves to this area. Let this be the model area where we will commit over whatever time is required to ensure that we do not revisit the same issues for this community in a decade or two.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	I agree with the Deputy's approach. Indeed, our own parliamentary party discussed this challenge last week. I am sure it is replicated in parts of the Deputy's constituency, as it is in parts of mine. Most Deputies experience the same and there is a resolve to see a response in the north inner city, which has particularly acute experience. As a former school principal in the area, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, knows this better than I do. As we respond to the challenges in this area, we need to develop a model that we can replicate and build upon for other communities. I have often been very impressed by the partnership companies and the way they can innovate in a way Government Departments cannot. We need to find ways of allowing a thousand flowers to bloom in different communities. One of the things I hope to do in the area of education is examine the concept of supporting innovation, particularly in respect of different community challenges.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	I wish to raise the issue of school patronage because there has been painfully slow progress in this area during the past five years.There is now an onus on the Minister to make this a priority issue in the education portfolio. If we are a true republic, we must ensure that our institutions respect and reflect the diversity of modern Irish society. This is true in respect of education in particular. The State has a serious responsibility to ensure that every child has access to a State-funded school in his or her own locality and that the ethos of that school reflects the ethos of the family concerned. A significant number of parents have no choice but to send their child to a school that does not align with their own belief system. Many parents feel they must baptise their children in order that they can be enrolled in a local State-funded school. This situation is entirely unacceptable in this day and age and must be dealt with as a matter of priority.  This week, the Minister appeared to endorse the community national school model, which involves splitting classes and segregating children on religious grounds for part of the school day. This happens because the Catholic Church insisted on a requirement to have faith formation classes and preparation for sacraments during school hours in these schools. We know this thanks to the excellent research carried out by Emma O'Kelly of RTE, who had access to documents obtained under the freedom of information provisions which showed that this was an agreement reached between the Catholic Church and the then Government in 2007. It is incredible that such an agreement was reached only nine years ago. I have two questions for the Minister. Will he commit this morning to repealing section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act in order to ensure that all children can access their local publicly funded primary school irrespective of their belief system? Will he end this most blatant form of discrimination against our children? Does the Minister accept that the community national school model entails segregation on religious grounds and runs counter to the principles of child-centredness and inclusiveness? If so, why is he endorsing it?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	I thank the Deputy for raising what I believe is an important question. There is no doubt that Ireland has changed and citizens have different expectations of all Departments, but most particularly in the area of education. It is my ambition to help parents to have access to the school of their choice. As the Deputy rightly points out, over 95% of our schools are denominational, and my ambition is to deliver the commitment in the programme for Government to treble the number of schools that offer alternatives to denominational patronage. My vision for this is to have as much diversity as possible. I do not see the merit in confining our approach to a single model. That is why I have sought to accelerate all the elements of the existing strategy and to provide new schools. Last week, I provided new schools in the Deputy's neighbouring area, Cabra, and in Marino, with Educate Together as patron. We need to continue to provide new schools with new patrons. Virtually all the schools where new patrons are being appointed are multidenominational or non-denominational. The progress that is being made on the transfer of patronage, which was initiated by Deputy Ruairí Quinn and continued by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is something we can accelerate. I will form a working group which will sit down with the Catholic patrons to seek to accelerate that work. It is recognised as an area in which slow progress has been made, but we hope to accelerate this progress. I do not share the Deputy's view regarding the role of the community national school. A school that is in State rather than private patronage and that offers, under one umbrella, the opportunity for faith-based instruction and makes provision for other options offers a good model that will allow us to transition. If we are moving from a situation in which more than 95% of schools are denominational we will need models that can accommodate parents with different views of the type of education their children should have, and the model of community-based national schools under the education and training boards, as a State-sponsored patron, is a good one that has potential. We have to look at it and look at the programmes that children who do not opt to be in a denomination receive. I am very open to considering how we can improve those programmes, but I do not share the Deputy's view that we should throw out a model that allows different views of education to thrive under one umbrella.

He is talking about endorsing a model that entails segregating children during the school day. How can that possibly be right? What he is suggesting is that education policy should put the interests of children second to the interest of any church. How can the Minister defend that situation? Just imagine that for a half an hour in every school day, children are segregated according to religion. That cannot possibly be right. At a very minimum, is the Minister prepared to insist that any denominational instruction is moved to the end of the school day so that we do not have this kind of divisive and anti-inclusive policy in operation in the community national schools? The Minister has not addressed the other question about section 7 of the Equal Status Act, which will continue to allow thousands of schools to discriminate purely on the grounds of religion. Is the Minister prepared to give a commitment to repeal that section here in order to stop that kind of discrimination?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	I do not agree with the Deputy. Children do different things during the course of the school day. If we can create a model that is acceptable to a lot of parents and that offers diversity within that school, it is something to be celebrated.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	It is something we should include. It is not the exclusive model. We will have the Educate Together model, the Gaelscoil model, some denominational models and so on. Diversity, with different education offerings to parents who want different things, is the right approach. On the issue of the Equal Status Act, it was not considered in the admissions Bill that was introduced during the last Government and it will not be part of the admissions Bill that I will publish soon, but the Dáil will have to debate its approach to this. There is constitutional protection for religions within our Constitution and the last Oireachtas committee recognised that there is a difficulty here. That has to be recognised. The Equal Status Act provides, and we will provide in the admissions Bill, that a denominational school must accept a non-denominational child, but if the school is oversubscribed that may not be the case, and 20% of schools are oversubscribed. This is a matter on which I will consult with other Oireachtas Members and we will be able to debate it in the Oireachtas.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	26	The disability Bill will be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny as soon as committees are established. That is fairly advanced. On the electoral commission Bill, a consultation paper has come from the committee and that is being discussed in the Department. Obviously, that will have to reflect on the pre-legislative scrutiny before it comes back to the House.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	27	There was some discussion earlier about the north inner city. In that regard and, more broadly, in respect of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill and prescription medicines, will the Minister confirm to the Dáil that this legislation will be taken and will proceed through the Dáil before it rises for the summer recess? That certainly would give heart to the people in the north inner city and beyond. The Government commitments to mental health services in the programme for Government seem opaque and non-specific. I note that A Vision for Change is up for review. I note also that the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland meets today to consider what industrial action it might take. Will the Minister tell us when we will see an implementation plan for investment and development in our very overstretched mental health services?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	28	The misuse of drugs legislation is being treated as a priority and will be dealt with in this session. On the issue of mental health services, I assure the Deputy that a great deal of care was put into the preparation of the programme for Government in respect of mental health. It is a shared priority of those who were involved in the negotiations, as it is within the Oireachtas as a whole. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who has responsibility in this area, has convened a task force and is working to develop the sort of plan the Deputy is keen to see evolve. A parliamentary question to the Minister of State would get an answer for the Deputy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	29	As part of this year's budget it was agreed that two weeks of paid paternity leave would be introduced from September of this year. To give effect to this, the paternity leave Bill would have to be passed by both Houses in the next few weeks. As it is on the list of priority Bills, when will we see the paternity leave Bill, will it be subject to legislative scrutiny and will it be enacted in time to fulfil the commitment that paternity leave will be available from September next?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	30	That is the intention. It will be an issue for the committee to decide whether it requires legislative scrutiny, but the Government is treating it as a priority.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	34	That is my understanding, yes.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	35	On secondary legislation, the decision to row back on the introduction of charges for green bins is a very welcome one but other problems have been caused because a number of waste companies have hiked their service charge from approximately €70 to €170 a year. That happened at the stroke of a pen, and it is having a major impact on low-income families. In the context of changing the regulations on the green bin, will the Minister also restrict the right of waste companies to hike their prices in this way, which impacts most on people on low incomes but also on older people who produce the least amount of waste but who will have to pay an extra €100 before they put a bin out? Will the Minister address that issue?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	36	I cannot answer on the Minister's approach to the elements of the service charge and therefore I will ask him to respond to the Deputy.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	37	How does the Government propose to deal with this morning's groundbreaking international decision issued against Ireland by the UN Human Rights Committee where Ireland, as a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was found guilty of violating the human rights of a woman who was denied a termination in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality? Not only is the Government, in the statement, obliged to provide her with an effective remedy, including compensation, but it is obliged to prevent similar violations in the future. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will be awarding compensation to the woman in question, and what steps will it take immediately to ensure human rights are not being violated by addressing the legislative shortcomings including, as suggested by the UNHRC, the amendment of our Constitution in regard to the eighth amendment?
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	38	On the same issue, when will we see the citizens' assembly?

I will not repeat the question but I will repeat what the UN's latest report has found, which is that Ireland's abortion ban subjects women to discriminatory, cruel and degrading treatment and it has called on Ireland to legalise the practices for pregnancies involving fatal foetal abnormalities. I listened to the Taoiseach last week misquote what has happened regarding various amendments to the Constitution.

#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	45	Does Deputy Collins wish to raise the same matter?
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	46	Yes. Following on from that question, and I would like the Minister to reply succinctly to Deputy Daly's question, I do not believe we should go to a citizens' convention on this issue. We discussed the issue in great detail in the previous Dáil and we should move quickly now to repeal the eighth amendment.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	47	Members should ask questions, not make statements.

I reiterate what was said by Deputy O'Reilly about the need to have that discussion in the convention as soon as possible in order that we can address the issue in regard to the eighth amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	50	I have not had the opportunity to see the report from the committee on human rights but I absolutely sympathise with and understand the concern of Deputies for any woman with a fatal foetal abnormality. I obviously cannot answer for what action the Government will take on foot of this finding. As the Deputy knows, change in the area requires an amendment of our Constitution, as Deputies have indicated. In the programme for Government, we have set out an approach where there will be within six months the establishment of a citizens' assembly. It will not have a specific mandate to reach any particular conclusion and it will obviously be open to the citizens' assembly to examine all the issues and come back to the Oireachtas.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	59	In the last Dáil there were hearings with expert advice. That allowed Deputies to see in a dispassionate way how difficult issues can be handled and it was of benefit to the Oireachtas. It had an impact and we know some Deputies could not accept it but that process allowed the Dáil to reach conclusions on an issue of the recognition of constitutional rights being converted into law that no Government had broached in previous years. The approach outlined is right-----

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	65	Is the Minister aware of the position in the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC - a body with which he is familiar - where a large cohort of workers are effectively being deprived of their pensions? Will the Minister tell me what, if any, action is being taken by the Government on foot of the issue? Will he arrange for either the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, to meet representatives of the staff? People are working side by side in exactly the same circumstances, with the same qualifications and doing the same job, but are in radically different positions. Some of them have protected State pensions but the rest will have practically no pension at all. Does the Government find that acceptable and what action is it taking?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	66	I understand, as the Deputy noted, that some workers in the Central Remedial Clinic are members of a pension fund that has got into funding difficulties. The board has decided to close the fund and that has major implications for those involved. I understand from the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that representatives of the Health Service Executive, HSE, met representatives from the CRC about this issue. I do not have an outcome to report on progress but efforts are being made to try to find a solution. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to respond to the Deputy about the work done.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	67	Is it the intention of the Government to provide an update to the Oireachtas on the status of the regional jobs action strategies that were published to much fanfare? The most recent quarterly household survey indicates unemployment in the south east is still at 12.5%, compared with less than 7% in Dublin, less than 6% in the south west and 5.5% in the east.
#TomNeville	unknown-#TomNeville-party	unknown-#TomNeville-dob	unknown-#TomNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	68	That is not true.

When is it expected to see an update on these regional strategies? They are meant to deal with these issues but, unfortunately, in the south east they have not been dealt with to the satisfaction of people living in the area.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	70	I welcome the Deputy's interest in this plan as I know it is an area in which we have worked together. I am grateful that the south east has one of the fastest growing employment rates in any region, although I fully realise it is coming from a position where it had many structural problems. There has been real success in the south east and the approach we have taken of creating a regional action plan, with much involvement from local people, including agencies, businesses and communities, is the right one. There are regional competitive funds and I am sure the south east is very competitive in seeking them. I am sure it would be open to the Whips to provide an opportunity to discuss the progress being made. It is an important issue and I know it will be built on in this Oireachtas. There is a renewed focus within the programme for Government on regional development. I thank the Deputy for his interest, as he has shown much interest in the past.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	71	I welcome that the Government has changed the €12 million cut to mental health services. When the cut was announced, it was indicated that this was not a cut but rather a "time-sensitive saving" as relevant personnel could not be recruited. If the relevant personnel could not be recruited four weeks ago, what has happened since meaning that relevant personnel can now be recruited? Will the money be spent on a different element under mental health? If that happens, it would also be very welcome. Will the Minister confirm where the additional €12 million will be spent? Over three and a half years ago, the Minister's previous Government cut the mobility allowance for people with a disability. At the time, a review was promised for completion within a number of months. We are three and a half years on but we are still awaiting the publication of the health (transport support) Bill. It is included in the programme published a number of days ago but will the Minister indicate what priority this will be given and when it will come before the House?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	72	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. There is no doubt the restoration of the mental health budget is universally welcomed, if one listens to the debate here. It puts the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in a position to develop a programme and it will obviously include recruitment of staff. As the Deputy notes, it can also consider other areas. I know the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will develop her plan to respond with this additional resource where I know the need is huge. There is no doubt about that. It is hoped the heads of the health transport Bill referred to by the Deputy will be available in July.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15891	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	73	My first question relates to procedural matters.

I was always given to understand that the timeframe was ten days so has there been a change in procedure in that regard?

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the time to move this Bill today. It amends the existing legislation and aims to provide for equality-proofing of Government policy, budgets and public bodies through impact assessments. Its aim is to promote equality in the functioning of public bodies and to provide for the carrying out of equality impact assessments in respect of measures that are likely to have a significant impact or effect on equality of opportunity. The Bill will ensure both Government and public bodies exercise their functions in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome that result from socioeconomic disadvantage. It is quite extensive. It puts a requirement on the State to carry out proper equality-proofed budgeting. We know from all the analysis from the ESRI that, budget after budget, income inequality has increased and poverty has increased. We want to get to a point where we know the impact of decisions at budget time and policies in terms of whether they will increase poverty. That is the thrust of the Bill.

Given the major and seemingly insatiable public interest in the various 1916 commemorations which we have seen, organised throughout the country and abroad by local and national organisations, by parties and by the Government, it would be appropriate that we would designate a day annually as "Lá na Poblachta" on 24 April to honour the ideals of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. Events would be organised on that day throughout the Thirty-two Counties and it would be designated a public holiday to help facilitate public participation in those events. The acceptance of my Bill would also encourage the study of the Proclamation and the ideals contained within it and of citizenship. It would also mean helping and encouraging the study of that period as a whole. It would be appropriate, given the year we have had, that 24 April 1916 be remembered on this day, the day the Proclamation of the Irish Republic was read at the GPO 100 years ago.

The biggest cost in insurance premiums, at 60%, is the legal cost. If one looks at the role and the history of the Fianna Fáil Party in government and the previous Government of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, none of them touched the legal profession. None of them went after the legal profession, even in the way the troika asked them to, which was through bringing down the legal costs in the country. That is probably one of the ring-fenced areas the troika did not go after and yet the ranks of both parties, particularly Fianna Fáil, are swollen with legal eagles of all sorts. I remember this being my experience on Dublin City Council in particular. The number of barristers and solicitors in that party who were also political representatives was quite astonishing.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	104	We are talking today about an issue where legal costs represent 60% of the total cost of motor insurance, and despite this, the legal industry is the sector that is least touched in terms of this. Despite the portrayal by the industry of the real cause of the increase in cost being the young, fast-moving drivers who are fraudulent, who get whiplash at the drop of a hat and who are making all sorts of spurious claims, the real costs are much more hidden, in terms of both legal costs and profits. When one looks at the profits of the big three insurance companies, it is quite interesting that they are not actually hurting all that badly. Aviva's profits were up by 38.5% in 2015. I know that includes all its profits, but nevertheless these are the profits of a company that insures everything from medical expenses to houses. It may well be hurting a wee bit on car insurance, but it is certainly making up for it elsewhere. In the same period, AXA Insurance made €76.9 million in profits and Allianz made €43.3 million. They claim their costs have increased, but their profits are certainly very healthy indeed. The Injuries Board shows a modest 8% increase in new claims in the 18 months to the middle of 2015. Some 70% of personal injury claims do not go to court, although there may be legal costs attached to them. The arguments of the industry that the claims are the problem do not really stack up and there is no real evidence to show it. The companies themselves have cited, among other reasons, a drop in investment income. In other words, they are investing money and profits in stocks and shares and the returns on these are dropping. Advice received by the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, from his own officials showed scepticism of the industry's claims about premiums rising because of compensation awards. They were very sceptical of these claims. The quote I would like to give Deputies from that advice is that from examining the evidence of awards it appears “motor insurers are now imposing higher premium rates to return themselves to profitability or to boost profitability after a number of years of insurers competing for market share, with prices driven down”. The officials also stated, “[t]he question does arise for motor insurers – if motor insurance is so unprofitable why does anybody do it?” We are constantly being told that competition is a healthy thing. It is supposed to be more efficient and it is supposed to improve the industry, but here is an example of the market ruling and making an absolute bags of an issue. It is making a bags of an issue where people are fundamentally legally required to have motor insurance but still the market does them nothing but disservice. The only way we can improve this situation for the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soaps, who are so well got to the hearts of the Fianna Fáil Party, is to have a State-run, publicly owned and controlled and publicly accountable company that will insure people who are legally obliged to have insurance. We need a company that is not subject to the diktat of the market, trying to make a quick buck by investing in stocks and shares, but rather serving the needs of the people for medical and other cover when they require insurance. There will be a cavalcade of protesters on this issue - young, old, long, tall, medium and short, the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soaps from Cavan to Kerry - descending on this city on Saturday, 2 July. It will be a well-organised cavalcade to protest against the soaring cost of insurance. I hope most Deputies who genuinely have the interest of Joe and Josephine Soap at heart will be out to support that protest.

Profits on car insurance were up 12% in 2014 and they were up 26.5% last year. According to Mr. Ken Thompson, the chief executive of Insurance Ireland, they will be up another 25% this year. My colleague, Deputy Smith, has quoted from the briefing document that was given by civil servants in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the previous Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, last year.In it they cast some doubt on whether the root cause of insurance price increases was, fundamentally, as a result of high compensation awards, fraud, etc. Instead they pointed towards attempts by these companies to boost profits by hiking prices to claw back losses made in the period 2010 to 2014. Let us look at that. The industry claims that between 2010 and 2014, it made losses on car insurance of €585 million. However, with insurance, of all industries, it is not a good idea to look at a narrow window of a couple of years because of the way claims pay out. One needs to take a longer view. For example, I could say that industry profits in 2005 - one year - were €582 million which would wipe out all the losses it made during those tricky years. Let us take the long view. Between 1994 and 2014, the insurance industry made pre-tax profits on car insurance in this State of €2.866 billion. This is an incredible figure. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, reported in 2002 that in the years 1983 to 1999, the return on car insurance in this State was 11 times the return, in terms of profits for the industry, than was the case in the UK. Between 2002 and 2008, according to the industry's blue book, that is, the statistics it produces each year, the profits as a percentage of claims paid were as follows: in 2003, it was 45.9%; in 2004, it was 60.2%; in 2005, it was a whopping 61.6%; in 2006, it was, 43.6%; and in 2007, it was 47%. It is quite clear there have been massive profits and profiteering by the insurance industry on car insurance in the State over decades. If there is to be an investigation, it must involve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth - not some of it. The MIAB's executive summary report, produced by Dorothea Dowling in 2002, stated:"It has not been this board's experience that insurers have willingly provided all material information in the fulsome manner which the Minister is entitled to expect." Let there be no business secrets here. The industry should be compelled to open the books for full inspection by servants of the State. We would be inclined to vote for the Sinn Féin amendment to the Fianna Fáil motion. We support the idea of an investigation, we want pressure to be brought to bear and we believe the amendment firms things up a bit. However, we have been here before. In 2002, the MIAB report made 67 recommendations, many of which were positive and some made a difference, but it did not change the model of insurance we have in the State. It did not touch the for-profit model and now, 14 years later, here we are back to square one. A new investigation can come forward with positive proposals and can make a difference but we will be back here again in a few years' time if the root cause of the problem is not addressed, that is, if we keep the for-profit model that has ruled the roost on this issue down through the years. It is time for that model to be dismantled and changed.

Guím comhghairdeas ar Fhianna Fáil as ucht an rún a chur os comhair na Dála. I am delighted to support this motion and I have no hesitation in doing so. This motion has been brought forward by Fianna Fáil but it is because of the outrage on the ground among ordinary people who are struggling to pay their bills: their water bills - those who are paying - their property charges and now a hike in insurance. I have heard of quotes going up 300-fold. Let us put this in context in that it is obligatory to have car insurance but there is very little public transport. Rural areas were mentioned but people are also forced into cars in cities, including in Galway, where I am from. The one-and-a-half page document, if I can call it a document, given to us by the insurance lobby group is lazy, unbalanced and self-serving. It has chosen to present certain facts while ignoring other facts. This is part of a campaign by the insurance companies that started with the abolition of juries and moved forward to the setting up of the former Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Now the industry is putting the blame on anybody but itself. There was an interesting article in the newspaper yesterday, which I would say Fianna Fáil Deputies have read in detail because they have quoted from it. However, we should give credit to the person who has pointed all of this out, the former chairperson of the MIAB, Ms Dorothea Dowling. I do not think she is a friend of the legal profession. She certainly highlighted the inadequate information given by the insurance companies. For example, in 2014, there were 31,576 claims and of those claims, all Ms Dowling and the courts can account for is 9,046. That means 22,530 claims were settled by the insurance companies but they have not given a single piece of information as to how the claims were settled or what they cost. However, they lambast the legal profession for its costs and they give out to the Garda for not doing its job but there is no obligation on the insurance industry to disclose any information as to how it is settling claims. Insurance companies point to fraudulent claims while failing to point out that legislation is in place - the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 - which gives huge powers to the courts to dismiss claims if there is any sign of a fraudulent claim or an exaggerated claim. The industry does not refer to that legislation. The industry gives no information on the number of policies repudiated by it. It is unacceptable for insurance companies to mount a campaign to force further changes without putting their hands up and saying: "We have increased costs by over 300% and 400% in certain cases". The industry has made huge profits but has not accounted for those profits. Dorothea Dowling points out that in the UK, which it wishes to copy in terms of the care culture rather than a compensation culture, the industry is breaking even but in Ireland it is making huge profits. The Sinn Féin amendment should also be taken on board because there is some merit to bringing the insurance companies before the finance committee and giving them a grilling, not least for their failure to give any information.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	108	The debate on this issue is based on the fact that people have been coming to Deputies' constituency offices. We have met many people, including taxi drivers who have seen their insurance increase by 300%, who are being quoted vastly outrageous charges for their insurance. I know of one particular case of a 28 year old woman who drives a Micra, which is 15 years old. The car has passed its NCT and it is taxed but when she went to seek her car insurance, she was told that it was going to go up by almost €700 or €800. She could not afford this so she went to other insurance companies to see if she could get a decent quote but she was refused. They would not even talk to her about it. They refused on the grounds the car was 15 years old and they would not even discuss it. She was told that the companies would not offer her any type of insurance, not even a quote of €3,000 or €4,000. This person has a young child and a part-time job and needs the car to get around, but she cannot get the insurance. It is outrageous that companies can do this. The point has been made that this is an industry which is hugely profitable. There is no transparency and it is very hard to get figures from the industry. Similar problems exist with regard to house insurance. The industry can refuse people on the basis of future potential risk in their communities and on where they live. These companies then expect the State to step in to create a situation where they can give insurance to people. If there is risk in a business, it must provide for that risk. It must be able to manage the risk and see what it can do. I absolutely support the concept of a publicly owned and controlled insurance industry, linked in with a proper transport system.I will be supporting the Sinn Féin amendment to the motion because I agree with the idea, as stated by my colleague, of the motor industry being brought before the finance committee and adequately questioned about its policy in this regard. It is important that the industry faces the ire of the people. It is good to have the debate, but it will not have been worth having if we do not see something result from it and it does not look like the Minister of State will try seriously to address the issue. It has to be done though because we cannot have a situation where workers cannot afford car insurance.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	109	We all know the overall figures. More than one third of Irish drivers have seen the cost of their insurance increase by more than 50% in the past year. We could all tell our own individual horror stories. It has gone beyond being a rip-off at this stage. Last week, a father contacted me about his son who paid €2,400 for his first insurance cover. His renewal quote was €3,100, which was then withdrawn, allegedly because he had changed from working in retail to being a labourer. They contacted the Ombudsman who told them to shop around, which they did, but the nearest quote was €6,500. This car is registered for social, domestic and pleasure purposes. It is not used for his job. The situation is utterly ridiculous. The young man ended up changing jobs because he needed a car but could not pay the cost of the insurance. The reality is that the increases being imposed are leading people to drive with reduced cover, which is very concerning, or to the imposition of severe economic hardship. It is simply unacceptable. We know AA studies and so forth have blamed fraudulent activity and high costs in legal claims. However, they fail to mention the profiteering of insurance companies. This is the nub of the issue. I support the Fianna Fáil measure calling for a national database to record premiums and settlements. This can be done anonymously and would help provide some transparency. The truth, however, is that there is no reason for the current situation whatsoever and the only credible explanation is that a cartel is operating for profit. For example, in the modern era of new technologies, the use of dash cams can be implemented. A dash cam can record footage which could be used as evidence in the event of a traffic incident. They can record speeds through GPS tracking and issue proximity warnings, for example, when changing lanes. The encouragement of the use of this type of technology has the potential to massively simplify the insurance process. Do the insurance companies want it? We can bet they do not, because there is a cartel of insurance underwriters and companies profiting from the current situation. I know of an insurance brokerage company which set itself up with the view to operating with dash cams in particular and using them as a mechanism to reduce premiums and simplify the claims process. The company was taken over by a bigger insurance company and the dash cam programme has ended up in the bin. That is the real nature of the insurance business in Ireland. Figures show that the number of collisions has declined with the implementation of these types of technology, which are already available. We could radically transform the situation. There is no need for it whatsoever and unless we get to the heart of the matter the problems will continue. It is simply unacceptable for young people, in particular, but for other drivers as well, who, as other Deputies have said, against the backdrop of an inadequate public transport system, need their cars and should be able to drive them safely.

Every Member of this House will have had a case brought to his or her attention regarding insurance costs in the past number of years. I am currently dealing with the case of a lorry driver with a clean licence who has never had an accident. His insurance bill last year was €1,320 and this year it is €3,847. He is just not in a position to pay it. This individual has children at school, but the lorry is parked up because he cannot drive it. He is in the process of trying to raise the money somewhere to pay for the insurance. We priced around with a number of insurance companies but they will not give him a quote. This is what is happening. Is it that these insurance companies are operating a cartel or something? I believe they are playing to their shareholders and maximising their profits. Unfortunately, many of these insurance companies are multinational companies, so I do not know if the Government can force them to bring down their prices. In 2002, when I was first elected to the Dáil, there was a major issue regarding insurance claims. The then Tánaiste, Mary Harney, introduced the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which brought down insurance costs in the following years. It is not just car insurance that has increased. Household and business insurance have also increased. This morning, I rang five business people in Galway. Their insurance costs have increased in the past two to three years by between 20% and 50%. In one company alone, there was a €70,000 increase in the insurance costs for a major factory. The owner told me he will have to let staff go if insurance costs continue to increase. Many other Members have also mentioned young drivers. Unfortunately, many of these drivers are finding themselves driving without insurance because they cannot afford to pay for it. I plead with them not to drive without insurance. It is a very serious offence, and God forbid there was ever an accident. They might buy a car for between €2,000 and €3,000 and the first insurance premium could be €4,000 to €5,000. Returning to the issue of the flood crisis in 2009, insurance companies refused to renew flood insurance for houses which had been flooded. We met the insurance regulator and, to be honest, it was a waste of time. He more or less told us he could not do anything and that it was the insurance companies who set the policies and the premiums. I know the OPW cannot give a commitment or assurance that following the carrying out of appropriate works a house would not flood again, but some insurance companies stated that even if the works were done they would still refuse to provide flood insurance. I know a review is being set up within the Department to try to deal with this issue but unless it has teeth and something can be done with the insurance companies, nothing will happen. Unfortunately, businesses and shops will close because the costs have gone through the roof. I ask and plead with the Government to ensure that if it does something regarding insurance, it is given some sort of teeth and will force insurance companies into action. Some Members have spoken about setting up a national insurance company run by the Government. I do not believe that is the answer, but something has to be done to ensure premiums are reduced. I hope that following this motion something will be done. I think that there will be consensus within the House and that all parties and Members will work together to try to find a resolution to the issue.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	112	I, too, compliment an Teachta McGrath and Fianna Fáil on tabling this motion, which is timely. I am delighted that in the spirit of the new politics it is not, as I understand it, being opposed by the Government. This is a very serious issue as we emerge from a dark, deep recession. I know this matter concerns car insurance mainly as well as commercial insurance, but this fledgling, recovering economy could be hijacked. That is what it is - a hijacking. I have to declare an interest. I have a small business and my insurance increased this year by 40%. I know of countless cases of people, both young and old, trying to get insurance for cars, homes and commercial premises and businesses who are aghast at the situation. Road hauliers have lobbied the Government a lot over the past number of years, as have I, and concessions were made in terms of the rebate on fuel. In fairness to the Government, last year it gave a huge rebate in terms of the tax on heavy goods vehicles. It seems as if the insurance company saw this niche and decided to nakedly claim back every ounce of this badly needed break. We are an exporting nation and we need our haulage industry to carry our exports abroad. Efforts were made following a lot of lobbying and there was huge satisfaction and appreciation for what happened.Lo and behold, as would only happen in this little country, the insurance companies cavalierly decided to balance it out because those involved had to keep paying anyway. That is the attitude. What are the regulator and the Competition Authority doing about the problem of insurance cover for young motorists and homeowners? As stated by Deputy Grealish, many people are now forced to drive without insurance, which I condemn out of hand. It is off the wall to drive without insurance. It is a serious issue. Further increases in insurance are not plausible.  The task force set up to examine this issue, which comprises officials from the Departments of Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport, is only tickling at it. We need firm action. While the Taoiseach and Ministers of the previous Government are to be complimented on their discussions with the insurance industry following the recent flooding, the industry took no notice of what was said. It takes no notice of anybody. The industry is doing what it likes, when it likes, and is charging what it likes. It would be more in line for it to address the issue of out-of-court settlements, which as a businessman I have been a victim of over the years. Despite strenuous efforts in putting together a meaningful defence, claims are often settled on the steps of the court without notification to the interested party, despite the fact that his or her premiums will likely be hijacked on renewal because of the claim payment. Premiums are also being increased following minor accidents. When my daughter was involved in a minor accident, the cost of her motor insurance increased immediately in anticipation of a payout which did not materialise until two years later. In fairness to the barrister involved, the case was fought well in court. There are too many of these cases. Pervious speakers referred to the 23,000 claims paid out in 2014 without accountability to anybody. The person who pays the piper - namely, the person paying the insurance - is the person who should call the tune. How can we expect the regulator and so on to know about settlements when the insured are not made aware of them?  We need a root-and-branch review of what motivates the insurance companies. I am old enough to remember the introduction of the PMPA levy and subsequent levies, which we are still paying. Levies are frequently introduced but never withdrawn. What is happening in the insurance industry is naked hijacking. If terrorists were doing this there would be an outcry about it and we would set the Criminal Assets Bureau on them. This is marauding by the industry with the full power of the law behind it, affecting businesses and ordinary people. Thus far the attempts to address this issue have been feeble, although I am not suggesting that the motion before us is feeble. We must deal with this issue, which is damaging to our economy. Deputy Grealish referred to countless cases of people who have been forced out of business. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, whom I wish well in her new role, is trying to stimulate business. The cost of insurance cover is outrageous. The legal profession must also take account of what is going on in terms of the staggering settlements being agreed behind closed doors. There is no transparency in that regard. Even the insured person is unable to find out the level of payment or cost involved in respect of a claim. All he or she can do is shut up and put up and pay the premium the following year regardless of the cost. Insurance cover for my business increased by 40% this year. No business can plan for such increases. The cost of insurance must be linked in some way to the cost of inflation. A business that successfully tenders for work to be carried out over a 12-month period may not be able to meet the cost of huge increases on insurance renewal mid-year. This is affecting countless businesses across the country, be they agri-contractors, plant hirers or road hauliers. It is also affecting many other self-employed people, including hairdressers and funeral directors. All businesses must have insurance cover.  There has also been a great deal of outcry in regard to the need for a review of rates, which I accept something needs to be done about. The issue of insurance cover has gone wild, although I do not know the reason behind this. Perhaps it is linked to our having been in election mode since last October and the fact that a Government has only recently been put in place. It is unacceptable. This issue must be addressed firmly. Task forces and so on will not suffice. We need legislation. We may also need to consider pay-as-you-go insurance, the cost of which would be added to the fuel tax. I have previously advocated such a proposal. There are many elderly people who only use their cars to get to mass or to collect their pensions on a Friday. They should be able to avail of pay-as-you-go insurance. The more mileage one does the more risk. That type of system might put manners on the insurance companies.

It is a great honour for him and his family. With financial services and government procurement in his portfolio, a background in nuclear disarmament may prove to be quite useful. I wish the Minister of State the best in his job. The Social Democrats support this motion on the establishment of a task force to examine the rising costs of motor insurance in Ireland. However, we would like to go further than that. We all know that motor insurance costs are skyrocketing. According to the Central Statistics Office, insurance costs increased by 32% in the last 12 months. We all know that at least some of the reasons for these increases are historic under-pricing by insurers, new rules requiring higher reserves to be put aside, elevated personal injury awards and lower investment returns. These costs are being passed on to motorists, with drivers being asked to pay an additional 50%, 75%, or in some cases 100%. People are being stunned by their motor insurance renewal bills. The reaction of some people is to question what they have done wrong that has caused their premiums to increase. Members of the Freight Transport Association recently reported premium increases of 50%, with some being asked to pay increases of up to 70% on their 2014-2015 premiums. It is not only in motor insurance that this is happening. Up to the end of March this year, home insurance premiums had increased by approximately 10%, and health insurance premiums have increased by more than 3% in the past year. This is in spite of the fact that 100,000 extra people have taken out health insurance following the introduction of lifetime community rating. The cost of health insurance for hundreds of thousands of VHI customers increased by an average of 3% since the beginning of May. This is the second increase announced by the State's private health insurer in the last six months. It rolled out an average price increase of 2% last November.  As alluded to by other members, insurance costs for businesses are also worrying. The Small Firms Association, SFA, reports that insurance costs for its members have increased by approximately 30% since 2011, which is a significant additional cost for any firm to bear, particularly small firms around the country that are hanging on by their fingernails. This amounts to an increase in the average cost per claim of 8% in private motor insurance, 27% in employer liability and 8% in public liability. Clearly, the average claim is increasing at a steep rate. How do we address this? We need to drive down average claim costs. We can reform how awards are set by the Injuries Board and the courts. We must also have better non-litigation options such that legal fees are reduced. I listened to a debate on this issue last night during which it was reported that 70% of claims are being settled out of court. There is no record of those transactions. The industry, rather than the State, is at fault in that regard. The industry must invest in proper data sharing. This happens in the UK and in Northern Ireland. Firms that are engaged here and in the North have invested in serious data sharing in the North but they have not done so here. The AA has suggested that a task force of all Government agencies be established. Obviously, this is a multi-departmental issue. The problem is not just related to motor insurance, nor is it related to insurance generally; rather, it is a problem related to the cost of living and the cost of doing business in Ireland. Child care costs here are the second highest in the OECD. Rents here have increased by over one third since 2011 and the cost of education has increased by almost 20% since 2011. Variable interest rates here are also much higher than in most European countries. The Social Democrats support the establishment of a task force on motor insurance, but we believe we have to be much more ambitious than that.There needs to be a task force - be it an expert group, an Oireachtas committee or some combination of these - which considers not just motor insurance or the insurance industry but which also systematically addresses the cost of living and of doing business and comes back with a multi-agency, multi-departmental recommendation so that people can get on with their lives. Then the money in their pockets can buy them more, they can afford a decent standard of living and small firms can reduce the cost of doing business and get on with expanding their operations and employing people.

Why has the Government not taken action in this area? We know that insurance costs are far too high. The current annual inflation rate is running at over 34%. We have no explanation for this and, as far as the Government is concerned, there is no real proposed action to tackle the problem. In recent years the rising cost of living on several fronts has been a significant problem for many families. This is one area that is driving up the cost of living for ordinary families. There are several actions the Government can take to tackle matters such as this in a way that does not entail expenditure but could reduce the cost of insurance, along with tackling water charges and ensuring greater competition on energy costs, which would have a huge impact on the cost of living and family budgets. Unfortunately, the Government has been quite remiss in this area and, rather than taking that approach to tackling the cost of living and dealing with the issues it has a role in, it has promised tax cats which simply erode the tax base and reduce the potential for investment in good quality public services. The Social Democrats identified the rising cost of insurance as a key area of concern in increasing family budgets. We dealt with this last year and raised it several times. We all became aware very quickly in the recent general election that this is a pressing issue for most people. It was one of the key issues that came up on the doorsteps and it has taken that for the Government to come up with some proposals for a potential task force. In many ways, that action is too little too late. The response of the Government has been too slow but the response of the Central Bank has also been too slow. A constituent recently told me that he received a quote for his 2009, 1.4L Renault Mégane of €873, up from €493 last year. Another constituent told me his insurance doubled from €600 last year to €1,200 this year. We hear these stories repeated over and again with no explanation offered. There is very little transparency in the insurance companies’ charging regime. It is very difficult to explain the difference between the increases operating in distinct but similar motor insurance markets. For example, there has been little or no premium inflation in motorcycle insurance for the past three years, apart from a significant blip of almost 6% last October. Motor car insurance premiums, however, have rocketed, with inflation of over 10% in each of the months since the autumn of 2014 and in excess of 25% in each of the months since autumn 2015. How can two very similar markets operate so differently? It is difficult to believe that there is not excessive profit-taking going on, yet, as the insurance industry points out, premiums have gone up and down in recent years. However, they are now 56% higher than at the end of 2011. This not only imposes a huge additional cost on individual families but also on businesses because the same kind of increases have been applied to commercial vehicles. I think of people trying to run small businesses, sole traders, people who drive taxis and so on. It makes it very difficult for them to operate in a way that returns any profit to their small business. This is a timely motion and we very much support it. It is long overdue.

I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, well and congratulate him on his appointment. Motor insurance is not like health, travel or home insurance. It is compulsory. A person found in control of a vehicle without insurance is guilty of a criminal offence. When we hear that the cost of motor insurance has risen by 60% since 2014, with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, confirming that there has been a 34% increase in the past 12 months, it is a cause for very serious concern. We do not need the CSO to inform us, as public representatives, because we have been hearing it anecdotally from constituents. For several years drivers benefited from competitively priced motor insurance premiums but the consequence of that was the collapse of insurance companies such as Quinn and Setanta and the consumer will be paying for this with a 2% levy on all insurance premiums for the next ten to 15 years. On top of that, today's insurance companies are in a race to return to profitability, with premium increases of up to 60% hitting already hard-pressed drivers and resulting in the negation of any well-deserved tax cuts they may have received in the recent budget. Increases are costing Dublin drivers, in particular, between €200 and €300 in many cases, regardless of the longevity of their accident and claim free record. While we are correct to focus on young drivers, this rightly angers and frustrates seasoned and experienced drivers who have a 25 to 30-year accident and claim free driving record. Dublin motorists have always been at a disadvantage because premiums have often been higher in the capital than in the rest of the country. In Dublin and across the country, these increases are resulting in very worrying trends where motorists are not insuring their vehicles. Unable to afford the spiralling cost of car insurance, some are taking to the roads with nothing but the sky for cover. This cannot continue. Even Insurance Ireland says high premiums are not in insurers' or drivers' interests as raising the threshold of affordability leads to more uninsured drivers. Insurance companies tell us that these increases are down to, among other things, fraudulent claims, higher rates of compensation being awarded in the courts and legal fees. Without the establishment of the independent task force that Fianna Fáil proposes, however, none of this can be confirmed. We are setting out clear proposals to tackle motor insurance costs. This would involve the reconstitution of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which was successful in reducing motor insurance premiums, to examine, in particular, the profitability of the industry, the settlement of claims and the impact of fraud and exaggerated claims on premiums. We need this task force to identify, once and for all, the root cause of these dramatic and crippling price increases. It needs to have access to data such as the amount of compensation awarded in private which never makes it into the public sphere. During the previous sustained period of rising motor insurance costs in the late 1990s, prices rose by 50% in seven years. The establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board helped reduce these costs by 40% in real terms between 2002 and 2013. Fianna Fáil believes there is a need to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which would include representatives from insurance companies, the Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, motorist representative bodies and the Road Safety Authority, to examine all the relevant issues that affect insurance premiums.I have received a raft of calls from constituents in the past month, in particular, regarding the rise in the number of cars, especially older cars, being abandoned in residential estates in my constituency. I am sure the two issues are connected. Given that car insurance is compulsory, the cost is a major issue for family finances. It impacts heavily on family budgets. Higher car insurance premiums mean families are doing without other essentials. Shopping around for competitive quotes is not only time consuming, but also seems completely fruitless. My party has a proud record of having addressed and effectively dealt with this issue in the 1990s and 2000s. It is that kind of action which is demanded by the motion. Dash cam technology is an innovation and initiative worthy of consideration, as are other non-legal avenues to address the issues. I strongly commend Deputy Michael McGrath on bringing the motion before the House, which proposes to establish a task force to address spiralling insurance costs. I am happy to support it on behalf of Dublin motorists.

I would also like to thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for once again putting forward a motion that makes a lot of sense and proposes a simple and achievable action. This is a new Dáil. Time and again we have heard calls for the Dáil to be taken seriously. I do not think we can accept the idea that we come in here and vote in favour of motions, and then return in five, six or eight months' time to find the will of the Dáil has been totally ignored and nothing has happened. If the Dáil accepts the motion put forward by my colleague, which I hope it will, that then is the will of the people's representatives and should be acted upon. It is very important that the Government immediately establish a task force to examine this issue. Since the motion was tabled a major debate has started. All of the inevitable interest groups said they were not the cause of the problem. Nobody has explained to us how, for example, the significant change in the number of fatal accidents over many years has not had the desired effect. There are many GoSafe cameras, but they have not had the desired effect of reducing accidents and, therefore, insurance costs. Many other things that have discommoded lots of our citizens have not had the desired effect of at least providing them with affordable insurance. We need to get to the bottom of what is going on urgently. We need evidence on whether there is any legitimate basis for charging extra premiums on older cars, when many such cars are used by families as a second car for runabout journeys. They never go at any great speed and are often driven by family members for school transport, going shopping and other such family business which is not high risk. We need evidence on the charging system. In the motion, Deputy McGrath clearly outlined the steps that need to be taken, the challenges we face in trying to find out the real basis for the increase in insurance premiums and whether it is evidence based. There is ample evidence that a lot of the necessary data is not available to make that judgment. In the short time available to me - two colleagues are due to follow me - I will make another point. There is a fantastic legal battle going on between different interest groups regarding Setanta. Those who were injured by drivers who believed in good faith that they were insured are entitled to compensation. Whether the compensation comes from the compensation fund or other funds, at the end of the day unfortunately it is likely to be motorists who, in one form or another, will pick up the tab. We need to bring this matter to conclusion and make sure that those who have suffered losses because of the failure of Setanta are paid what they are due. We need to make sure that type of bad regulation cannot happen. A company which is regulated abroad cannot come into the Irish market without proper prudential scrutiny having been carried out to ensure it will not collapse. Unfortunately, my time is up. Deputy O'Dea will be delighted to note that I have finished five seconds early.

I congratulate the Minister on his appointment, and wish him the very best and a long and profitable period in his position. I also want to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on bringing forward this very timely motion. Due to time constraints, I cannot discuss the structural problems of the insurance industry or the implications of Setanta and Quinn. Therefore, I will confine myself to making a few general points. One of the main determinants of the amount one pays into any fund, including insurance funds, is how much the fund has to pay out because, after all, it is a commercial operation. There is no doubt that the amounts paid out here by way of insurance awards are dramatically out of line with the rest of the world. For example, some 80% of minor car accident injuries in Ireland involve whiplash. Whiplash awards here are about three times the level they are in the UK and are an even greater multiple of the amounts in other jurisdictions. There is no logical basis whatsoever for this. What is the justification for it? Another problem with the costs incurred that determine how much people have to pay into an insurance fund is the process by which awards are now determined. As Deputy Grealish and others said, we set up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to deal with the level of costs in the motor insurance sector. Unfortunately, it has been gradually eroded over the years. I understand it now only deals with about 20% of claims. It was eroded by the legal profession which found a way to get around it by claiming psychological damage, which means claimants are automatically out of the ambit of PIAB. In addition, the section of the legislation which prevents somebody seeking an offer through PIAB from having an each way bet in terms of rejecting it and going to the courts is not being enforced at all, as far as I can see. For many years it has been suggested that we have a statutory system for all but the most extreme cases, such as cases of very grave personal injury where people have become paraplegics, etc. We currently have what is called a book of quantum, which is supposed to be a list of indicative awards for particular types of injury. However, it is based on the prevailing level of awards which means that it is quite useless. If we base awards on the book of quantum, the only way insurance premiums can go is upwards. Premiums have risen by over 60% over the past three years. I have received the latest figures from the CSO, which show that in the 12 months to the end of May, insurance costs in Ireland rose by 35.5%. There is no logical justification whatsoever for that. It is long past time that we took action to deal with the issue.  Deputy Michael McGrath's motion proposes a task force. I note the Minister for Finance told the House there would be a review. When he addressed the House yesterday, the review miraculously morphed into a Department of Finance task force. More surprisingly, at the end of his speech the Minister said when the task force eventually reports, there might then be a need for another task force, I presume along the lines of what is proposed by Deputy McGrath, to examine the problem further. With all due respect to the Minister for Finance, who is a good constituency colleague of mine, that does not indicate that the Government accepts the urgency which attaches to this problem. Over the past two years we have had debates, analysis, scrutiny and discussions, but now we need action. It seems to me that a task force along the lines proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath, provided the Government's puts a time limit on it, would be the springboard to action in that regard. Action is badly needed. Other speakers have pointed out how the increased cost of insurance is eroding disposable income, costing jobs and damaging the economy. It is a matter of great urgency, particularly when one considers the 35.5% increase in the past 12 months. It is time to do something. I urge the Government to accept the motion and to proceed with the task force without delay.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	119	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the motion on the cost of motor insurance. It is most important that the Minister would accept the motion from Deputy Michael McGrath because of the seriousness of the situation currently and the pressure it is putting on so many individuals and families. This is a concern that is raised with me on a regular basis by my constituents. In the past week, one constituent highlighted to me that their motor insurance premium had increased from €900 to €1,300 on renewal. The car in question is seven years old and the person has a full no claims bonus. The issue is becoming most serious. Another constituent who is in the commercial haulage business is now considering moving his headquarters abroad so that he will be in a position to secure more competitive insurance for his business and compete more effectively with other transnational haulage companies that have access to lower insurance costs. As we know, consumers have been faced with an increase of 60% in the cost of their motor insurance since January 2014, and the situation is now becoming a critical one for Irish consumers and businesses, particularly haulage-related businesses. The increasing cost of insurance is also affecting our competitiveness, and action must be taken to reverse the trends that have emerged. Not only has the increasing cost of insurance affected individuals, but it will also become a barrier to better maintaining or creating jobs in our economy. The reductions in the universal social charge in the last budget will become meaningless if the benefit is cancelled out or even exceeded by the increase in the cost of motor insurance. Much debate at election time revolves around tax cuts to help with living standards. While that is very important, not enough emphasis is placed on the cost of living, which includes the cost of motor insurance. We must focus on introducing polices that assist in reducing the cost of living and bring about a better standard of living. The motion is designed to achieve that. There is little point in sharing the benefits of a modest recovery by reducing taxes such as the USC if it is going to be cancelled by increases in motor insurance. In effect, the reduction in the USC, and more in addition to that, is transferred to the coffers of the insurance companies, which further bolsters their profits. Any reduction in the universal social charge should be a direct benefit to workers and should not be taken away by inflated insurance costs. Giving more disposable income to workers is better for the economy and provides a stimulus for growth and a benefit to local businesses. All our efforts should be focused on ensuring that we increase disposable incomes, which then become available to the economy, rather than having them grabbed by the motor insurance industry. There are 12 key elements in our action plan to tackle motor insurance costs, and I will focus on two of them. First, we need to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB. Given the previous track record of the MIAB, that seems to be an imperative action for the Government if we are to make progress in reducing motor insurance costs. The board should be given a specific timeline to report to the Dáil or an Oireachtas committee on its recommendations to tackle the high cost of motor insurance. The board should comprise representatives from insurance firms, the Department of Finance and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, motorist representative bodies, haulage companies, representatives of older people and the Road Safety Authority to examine all relevant issues that affect motor insurance premiums. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board established in the late 1990s put forward recommendations that helped reduce insurance costs by 40% in real terms between 2002 and 2013. That was a significant achievement at the time and there is no good reason not to establish such a board again. Second, I wish to highlight the more vulnerable motorist. Those on low incomes and older people who use their own transport are particularly vulnerable to increasing insurance premiums, as increases in insurance costs eat up a greater proportion of their disposable income. Their income tends to be fixed, so if there is an increase in insurance costs they have less net income to survive and they become more vulnerable from a financial perspective, when we should be trying to make them more secure. Recently, some insurance firms have begun to restrict the availability of cover to cars older than 14 years, which often affects those on lower incomes and older people. Currently, individual insurers have the right to refuse cover, but it is not acceptable to have a blanket refusal to quote for business for vehicles older than 14 years. That could be construed as a targeted attack on the most vulnerable motorists and people in society. We must introduce legislation to limit the ability of insurance firms to refuse cover in such circumstances without a valid reason other than simply the age of the car.

#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	121	I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the very best of luck in his new Department. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion and the issue of rising insurance costs. Insurance costs have become a major issue facing motorists and the Government must explore every avenue to reduce insurance costs. Over the past year, increases of 30% and beyond in insurance premiums have become an industry norm. Figures released by Insurance Ireland show that the number of motorists denied quotes by three or more companies in the past two years has almost quadrupled, with no figures available for 2015 as yet. Serious challenges are presented to the sector given the cost of insurance and the difficulty in getting viable quotes. Many leading companies are embarking on a policy not to ensure cars over 15 years old, and young drivers are experiencing extreme difficulties. I welcome the action the Government has taken to curb the rise in insurance costs - namely, the establishment of a task force in the Department of Finance, which is carrying out a review of policy in the insurance sector. It is clear that the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of Departments, State bodies and private sector organisations. I understand the task force is due to report back to the Minister shortly. I note the Minister held a meeting in his Department on the 3 December last with insurance industry representatives in response to the increasing cost of insurance. However, while it is easy to highlight the problems, we must also put forward credible solutions. High Court awards have increased and the Injuries Board does not seem to have the influence on claims that it used to have. The book of quantum produced by the Injuries Board on the size of awards for various injuries has not been updated in the past ten years. I know work is under way in that regard, but one new initiative would be international benchmarking. For example, awards for whiplash account for 80% of motor insurance claims in this country, and awards amount to approximately €15,000 here compared with £5,000 in the UK. We must review legal costs for litigated cases across the board, given that costs have increased sharply in recent years. Reports by the industry that legal costs make up 60% of awarded claims are most worrying. We must guarantee that insurance fraud is tackled, as fraudulent cases have a significant impact on the industry as a whole. It is estimated that uninsured driving represents an annual cost of €60 million to the industry, and we must ensure maximum resources are available to eradicate such practices. There can be no substitute for law enforcement. We must assess the possibility of an international benchmark of premiums. We must also strengthen the PIAB. We must recognise that the claims environment has changed dramatically and new powers are required. Those include simple changes such as compelling claimants to provide loss of income information and to attend for medical assessment. The Central Bank must ensure that greater transparency is provided by insurance companies in the information supplied to it. We must also restore core competitive underwriting to ensure it becomes profitable again, as opposed to being subsidised by investment income. Many of those ideas have been raised by industry experts in the media in recent months. I am hopeful that the new task force will take all views into account prior to making its recommendations to the Minister. I hope sustainable insurance premiums will be available to all.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	122	I welcome the opportunity to speak today on this important topic. Insurance costs in Ireland, both general and motor, have risen considerably in recent years, and figures from the Central Statistics Office show that insurance costs in Ireland have risen by almost 30% since 2011 with motor insurance prices rising almost 34% over the same period. These rises are unsustainable and from dealing with my constituents, I am familiar with the true cost of rising insurance prices. I have heard of cases in which premium prices have risen by 400% or even more. I regularly hear of premium prices being quoted at €4,000 and more for cars that are worth much less than that. In one case, a constituent who drives a 2000 Polo with a 1-litre engine was given a quote of €5,000 for insurance, which would be reduced to €3,000 were he to install a driving monitor box. He has a full driving licence and a no-claims bonus. Other people who had been paying annual premiums of approximately €500 are now being asked to pay premiums in excess of €1,000 and in some cases are not being given quotations at all. It is my understanding that County Louth is one of the hardest hit areas when it comes to insurance premiums and this situation must not be allowed to continue. Members must get to the bottom of why premiums are rising so dramatically, particularly over the past 12 months. I welcome that the Department of Finance has a task force carrying out a review on the insurance industry, which will report to the Minister shortly. This review is badly needed and I look forward to reading its findings. I have spoken to various people in the insurance industry who have offered a number of reasons for rising insurance costs. These include past underpricing in an effort to win market share, High Court awards and legal fees, the role of the Injuries Board, and an increase in the number of claims. Moreover, in the past, there was subsidisation of competition on premiums by investment income and other measures. In addition, claimants are now more likely to engage a solicitor to handle claims, resulting in claims taking longer to settle and in higher legal fees. Another cause for concern is the incidence of fraudulent claims. While I understand the reasons given by the insurance industry for increased premiums, I do not believe these costs alone could result in such dramatic increases in premiums. As I stated earlier, I look forward to the findings of the task force put in place by the Department of Finance. I believe radical reform is required, particularly in the areas of legal fees and awards given. I believe both the awards given and the legal fees charged are too high. It is estimated that legal fees can make up to 60% of the cost of claims. This is too high and must be addressed. We must also consider the area of fraud. Fraud is costing the industry and although measures have been taken recently to address it, more is needed. Members must get tough on fraud and it must not be allowed to be perceived to be acceptable. In conclusion, I reiterate the point that serious reform is required in the insurance industry. Members must tackle immediately the causes of rising insurance costs. They must identify the causes of such a dramatic rise in insurance premiums and I believe we must reform the Injuries Board. Finally, I look forward to the findings of the task force set up by the Department of Finance to examine the rising costs of insurance. Members must act now to ensure that insurance costs are brought under control.

At the outset, I wish to record my anger, disgust and deep regret about some of the motor insurance quotations that are being issued nationally by most Irish insurance companies this year. I also express my full support for this motion that has been proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party and that calls for a task force to be established to investigate and take real action on this matter. If anything is to come from Government support of this motion, it must be that it listened and took real action on the issues raised within the motion. Some motor quotations I have seen in recent weeks are simply appalling. Most quotes I have seen were increased by more than 60% for no reason whatsoever. The drastic rise in insurance premiums is affecting all drivers on the road, as young and old drivers, returning immigrants and male and female drivers all are witnessing unfair and crippling increases. No one is immune. In the case of young drivers, I met a young man from County Leitrim this week who had contacted me about his insurance. He had a no-claims bonus for two years and no penalty points but this week was quoted a price of €2,700 for motor insurance, which was an increase of more than €1,200 from 2015. Can anyone justify this rise? How can this young person be expected to keep his part-time job, travel to football or make his way to college independently at such prices? It is an absolute scandal. As for older drivers, I also met another person from County Sligo who has been driving on a full licence since August 1972 with no accidents, claims or convictions. In 2015, his full comprehensive policy with every conceivable extra, including no-claims protection and windscreen and breakdown cover, as well as with no penalty points, cost €365. This year, however, his quote for renewal was €860. This is utter madness. Drivers of older cars are also being discriminated against by Irish insurance companies. I am advised that neither Aviva Insurance nor Allianz Insurance will insure cars that are more than 15 years old. The car in question was registered in 2000 or 2001 and if this is the case, what is the point of having a national car test at all? A car that has passed an NCT should not be discriminated against by insurance companies and this should be made law. I also have learned about issues affecting emigrants returning home, who are being told they have no right to their no claims bonuses from other countries. Despite living in a technical age, one is advised that Irish insurance companies cannot receive such information from another company but I ask, why not? I believe the current situation is spiralling out of control at a rapid pace. As Members of a national Parliament, Deputies must take urgent action to address this issue in the next few months as they would be failing their constituents otherwise, many of whom risk losing employment due to these increases. While it is important to debate the reasons insurance companies believe they can charge such extortionate prices, my own understanding is the number of claims has increased and the value of compensation claims also is very high. One also is told of the damaging effects false claims and the collapse of both Quinn Insurance and Setanta have had on the industry. However, I do not believe Irish insurance companies can stand over the current level of increases due to these problems. I believe what is at play here is a realignment of insurance prices by key players to levels that obtained before the introduction of low-cost providers in the early 2000s. It appears there is now an opportunity to reset the industry and this is why such increases in the price of premiums are taking place. Members must take on insurance companies that are charging these prices and set up a task force that will make strong recommendations. Moreover, strong Government action this issue is required.
#NoelRock	unknown-#NoelRock-party	unknown-#NoelRock-dob	unknown-#NoelRock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	124	Many contributors to this debate have outlined the scale of the problem in great detail, the most alarming feature of which is the CSO figures, which indicate a 35.5% increase has taken place over the past 12 months. This places further unsustainable pressure on people of all ages and all backgrounds, who frankly are struggling with the cost of living at present. This, allied with a 9.2% rent increase across the board, is placing great pressure on people in respect of the cost of living and must be addressed urgently. As such, I welcome this motion which is good and has good foresight. The idea of establishing a task force with a view to taking action on the causes of the problems in the insurance sector is good. I am glad to note it appears as though the motion has secured support from right around the House, which is heartening and goes to show the pursuit of new, consensus-driven politics. When one considers the problems and how they affect individuals, I certainly can state I have been inundated by people contacting me on the costs of their own insurance. For example, a 19-year old who had an insurance premium costing €2,000 last year has now had the cost of his premium increased to €3,200 this year, which is a stunning increase. Similarly, I refer to a 54% increase in respect of a 1-litre Micra and a 70% increase on a 1.1-litre Yaris. These are extraordinary increases being faced by people, young and old, working and unemployed, as well as students and people from all sorts of different walks of life. It is incumbent on Members to examine the reasons for this and to try to address the root causes. As such, I believe the task force is a good idea, as is strengthening the Injuries Board. I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out that legal fees are making up to 60% of many claims. This is an alarmingly high figure, but even more alarming is that eight out of every ten motor injury claims in Ireland are for whiplash.In Ireland, the average whiplash claim is €15,000 while, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, it is approximately one third of that in the United Kingdom. It is less in other jurisdictions.  The Fianna Fáil motion is right to point out that nothing replaces increased road traffic enforcement in terms of getting uninsured cars off the road. Such cars lead to an increase in costs for all those who work hard, play by the rules and insure their own vehicles. It is incumbent upon us to bring about more enforcement. We hope that the investment in An Garda Síochána's road traffic enforcement will go a long way towards achieving that.  In the limited time available I have spoken about the impact on individuals, as well as some of the welcome solutions that have been set out in this motion. I welcome the motion and look forward to hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on the matter.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	125	On a personal note, I wish to thank Deputies for their good wishes. The discussions that have taken place regarding motor insurance are timely and, in this regard, Deputy Michael McGrath's motion is very welcome. I also welcomed this opportunity to hear contributions from other Members both yesterday and today. It is clear that the rising cost of motor insurance is a shared concern across the House. As outlined yesterday by the Minister for Finance, the Government is not opposed to the Private Members' motion calling for a task force on motor insurance matters, which has been tabled for discussion both yesterday and today. The Minister for Finance has highlighted that he has already established a task force in his Department to carry out a review of policy in the insurance sector. This project will examine all of the issues relating to insurance policy and will include all of the matters raised in this discussion. One of the major issues to be addressed by the task force is an examination of the factors which have led to the significant increase in motor insurance costs in recent years and, of course, to recommend what steps can be taken to influence the situation. Neither is the Government opposed to the amendment to the Private Members' motion. The Government would welcome any discussions on the issues of insurance and the insurance industry in the new Oireachtas finance committee when it is formed, and will look at any legislative proposals that may arise from those discussions. The Department of Finance has a task force in place which is addressing the issues raised. Publication of the Department of Finance's report will be considered as soon as the Government has an opportunity to review it. As the Minister outlined in his speech yesterday, the review of insurance policy will examine the issue of data and the need for more detailed information to be available regarding claims costs and insurance policy data. A Bill is currently being drafted on the merger of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pension Ombudsman. The points raised in the amendment on increasing the power of the Financial Services Ombudsman could be examined under the pre-legislative scrutiny process for that Bill. With regard to the Central Bank, it should be remembered that the Oireachtas has the power under section 33AM of the Central Bank Act 1942 to call certain staff of the Central Bank, including the Governor and the head of financial regulation, to appear before a joint committee of the Oireachtas. Those called shall provide that committee with such information as it requires, subject to certain conditions. This provision was introduced under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. On the call for a review of the Central Bank of Ireland regulation, it should be noted that the IMF has recently undertaken a detailed review of the Central Bank as part of its financial sector assessment programme. This report examined all the supervisory areas of the bank, including insurance supervision, and it will be published over the summer months. A number of additional issues were raised in the House yesterday during the Members' contributions. They span the work of several Departments and offices, and they will also be addressed as part of the current review. These include the lack of a link between the national car test and the availability of insurance; insurance costs for the young and those over 65; the case for rural dwellers with no public transport to have car insurance at a reasonable cost; the issue of returning immigrants having difficulty obtaining car insurance; and the cost of insurance to taxi drivers, hackneys and hauliers. The Department of Finance is aware that certain groups are particularly affected by the increase in insurance costs. The Department will undertake an examination of the underlying issues as part of its review. The Department of Finance task force will report to the Minister for Finance shortly on the first phase of its work dealing with the insurance compensation framework. This work is focused on developing an insurance compensation framework that will provide clarity and certainty regarding the insurance compensation framework in Ireland. This work is being done jointly with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The work of the task force will be completed over the coming months. The outcome of the review will be to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector. This work on insurance costs fits with the programme for a partnership Government commitment to a fairer society in Ireland. I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's review of the Injuries Board legislation aimed at strengthening the legislative framework in terms of operational issues. I also welcome the review of the Injuries Board's book of quantum, which is expected as soon as possible. The cost of meeting expected claims is one of the main drivers of insurance costs. As the Minister for Finance stated yesterday, the Government welcomes proposals to reduce the uncertainty and volatility of the claims environment in Ireland. This core issue is being examined by the Department's review of insurance policy. The Government will await the completion in the coming months of the existing Department of Finance insurance task force's work. The Government will then consider what further longer-term options may be required, including the possible establishment of a broader structured task force on motor insurance, as outlined in the motion. I thank the House for the opportunity to debate this important issue concerning the rising cost of motor insurance.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	127	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on his foresight in addressing this issue. The response, which has achieved consensus around the House, is based on stories we are all hearing from our constituents. Many people have come to my constituency office to outline some really harrowing stories. There is a belief that motor insurance has probably risen by 35% across the board. However, I have heard cases involving increases of between 60% and 100% where there has been no material change in the existing contracts, including the vehicle or any past history. The haulage sector has indicated that it is finding things difficult given the spiralling costs. One particular haulier identified an increase of 160% in insurance costs. Unlike others, he was in a position to challenge and fight the case, otherwise it would have put him out of business. As a result of that, he succeeded in getting a much lower cost.  It is clear that the insurance market is not functioning appropriately. There is a lack of competition, as a result of which insurance companies are sitting on their hands. They are getting the business in, passing costs on, and putting a margin in that people cannot afford.  When Quinn Insurance was in the market it changed the way business was done. It had solvency issues which have created a significant cost for the State. Quinn had an aggressive approach to the management of claims which, at the time, forced other companies to do the same. The appropriate management of cases and claims has gone with the exit of Quinn from the sector. Insurance companies now prefer to settle out of court - sometimes on the steps of the court - without an appropriate level of detailed investigation which would manage costs downwards. The companies know that the market will carry that cost.  It can only be seen as an element of price gouging in recognising that the economy is improving in certain areas and that the burden can be carried by consumers. The haulage sector was hard pressed and the Government responded by lowering truck taxes, yet that saving is now being eaten up by spiralling insurance costs. In other jurisdictions the cost of insuring a truck varies from €1,200 to €2,500. Here, however, it ranges from €3,000 to €6,000 per truck, or even higher. That is not acceptable.  A number of things need to be done over and above what is set out in the motion. We need to examine claim management. In addition, the book of quantum should be reviewed and used by the Judiciary. We also require a greater level of consistency in terms of how courts deal with claims. 
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	128	I thank all Members who contributed to this crucial debate, including my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who proposed the motion. Having listened to all of the contributions, it is obvious that the issue is a very real one in every constituency. The anecdotal evidence includes examples of premiums doubling or trebling in some cases. The CSO has confirmed that premiums have risen by 60% since the beginning of 2014 and by 24% in the past 12 months. While I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing our motion, it must be acknowledged that we are debating this matter because of inaction by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. As with so many other issues in the past, they failed to listen to warnings on this side of the House. Consequently, motorists have continued to pay crippling and exorbitant premiums. I will cite an example.At the end of last year my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, during Leaders' Questions with the then Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, raised the need to establish this task force. Her reply was that the price of petrol at the pumps was falling. Quite simply, that showed the lack of priority that was given to it. Last night, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirmed that the data available to her Department from the Injuries Board does not support the sector's claim regarding the volume and cost of claims. However, less than 25% of claims go through the Injuries Board. There is an issue in that regard. The Department initiated a review of the Injuries Board in June 2014, but almost two years later the review is not complete. The Minister said last night that she hopes to seek Government approval of a draft Bill before the end of the year. What is the delay? Meanwhile, motorists are facing exorbitant, crippling premiums. Last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, confirmed that he had been conscious of the issues for some time. However, it took until two months ago to establish a review. It is interesting how the review has suddenly become a task force. In reply to many of the parliamentary questions tabled by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, it was always called a review. There was no mention of a task force. There is no clear timeframe for when this review is to report to the Minister. Will it take the same length of time as the Department is taking to review the Injuries Board? Will we be here two years hence still waiting for the conclusions of the review? The time for procrastination is over. It is time for action. Yesterday, our party published a comprehensive action plan to deal with the exorbitant cost of motor insurance. One of its key pillars is the re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. We are not talking about reinventing the wheel. There is no need to wonder whether it will work because we have evidence that it worked in the past. When it was established in the early 2000s, the board contributed significantly to the reduction of premiums by approximately 40% between 2002 and 2013. As a previous speaker indicated, we have all been contacted by various representatives of the different stakeholders to tell us it is not their fault that the cost of premiums is increasing. It is not the legal profession's fault and it is not the result of the insurance companies gouging people and seeking to increase their profits. While each stakeholder blames the other, the end user is being crippled. This is crippling jobs and having an impact on the cost of living and people's quality of life. A rural constituency such as mine does not have public transport. People need their cars to go to the shops, to work, to church or wherever they must go. At present, the cost of insurance is preventing people from using their cars, and it is preventing people who have two cars from using the second vehicle. We cannot wait, therefore, for an unknown length of time for a review - that suddenly has been ramped up to a task force - to report back on what must be done. The time for debate is over. The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whom I wish well in his new role, concluded by thanking Members for the opportunity to debate this important issue. We need not debate it further. We know what the issues are. What we need is action. By virtue of the fact that the Government is not opposing this motion, it is accepting its content. It is accepting the proposal to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. We will return in a number of months to ask the Government what action it has taken to ensure that the men and women we represent do not continue to pay crippling motor insurance costs indefinitely into the future. They have been paying such costs for the past two years, which is too long. The time for that is over, as is the time for debate. The time for action is now. We will return before the summer recess to ask the Government what it has done with regard to the motion that the Dáil is now going to pass.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	130	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves Ireland's accession to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a Battlegroup to be made available to the European Union in the second half of the year 2016. Ireland's participation in the UK-led EU battle group is set in the context of our long-standing national policy. The term "battle group" is an unfortunate title. It is a technical military term intended to describe the size of the force rather that its role. The term does not accurately portray the tasks which such groups, if deployed, can carry out. They are designed to react rapidly to crisis situations and the tasks that are carried out relate to peacekeeping, conflict prevention and assistance to humanitarian operations. When it comes to these tasks, our national policy recognises the primacy of the United Nations. This is recognised in our triple-lock mechanism. In terms of EU policy, it is my view and that of the Government that the United Nations must continue to be the partner of choice for the EU. It is important, therefore, that we maintain a close engagement and collaborative relationship with the UN. Our traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected
by our involvement in EU battle groups. The establishment of EU battle groups is something the UN recognises and supports, as they facilitate rapid responses to emerging crisis situations. This is a key objective of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy. The purpose of the EU battle groups is to undertake operations as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty. These operations, known as the Petersberg Tasks, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. In the Lisbon treaty, these tasks were expanded to include joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile states, conflict prevention, and post-conflict stabilisation.A central plank of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations. In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council when it comes to international peace and security. This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Participation in EU battle groups is another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles. The Defence Forces' contribution to this battle group will comprise five staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters located at Northwood and Catterick in the UK where they will be engaged in training and planning activities. The UK battle group memorandum of understanding is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Cyprus. It sets out principles relating to the operation, deployment and management of the UK battle group. Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, deal with the definitions and reference documents that are applicable to this memorandum of understanding. Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, deal with the consultation process, exercise, training, certification and the operation of the battle group. One important issue to note is that each participating country retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation. Equally, each participant retains the right to withdraw its contingent at any time. As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the UK battle group will still be subject to a UN mandate and Government approval and this will remain unaffected by Ireland signing the memorandum of understanding. While Dáil approval is only required in respect of deployments of 12 or more personnel, in the event that any decision might be required on an actual deployment, I will be happy to facilitate discussion in the House in such circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that the number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this particular EU battle group is five. Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, outline the arrangements in terms of financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities. Sections 14 to 16, inclusive, deal with the process of participation of additional states in the battle group, the timelines for coming into effect and termination of the memorandum of understanding and the process for dispute resolution. The memorandum of understanding is similar to those Ireland has previously signed for the 2008, 2011 and 2015 Nordic battle groups, as well as the 2012 Austro-German battle group. While no battle group has deployed to date, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits in terms of developing improved inter-operability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states. It enables Irish personnel to take part in exercises and develop expertise which adds to our ability to work in partnership with other countries on UN peacekeeping missions.  The purpose of battle groups is, very simply, to enable the Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability. Ireland's participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces. It also enhances Ireland's credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations. It reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union's common security and defence policy in support of international peace and security and the UN. Our involvement continues Ireland's proud tradition of participation in international peace keeping operations.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	131	I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on his new responsibilities and wish him all the best in this new role. Furthermore, I express my thanks to the Minister of State and his officials for the general defence briefing I received last week. It is clear that the Minister of State will be well served by his officials and I greatly appreciate the courtesy shown to me by him and his officials. This is my first outing in this House as my party's spokesperson on defence and it is a great honour for me, especially in view of my own service in the Reserve Defence Force for many years. I want to say very clearly to all my friends, and now former colleagues, in the Defence Forces, regardless of whether they are Permanent or Reserve, that my party and I value their work and take enormous pride in their achievements at home and abroad. We are on their side. We firmly believe that our Defence Forces are of critical importance for both State and society and it is my view that we need greater appreciation of the social benefits for both the community and members of our Defence Forces. In that light and on the basis of that belief, I want to give the following message to the Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence. I wish to make it clear to him that I mean him no disrespect whatsoever because the allocation of political responsibility for defence is not his decision. There is great disappointment in the Defence Forces at the absence of a Cabinet-level Minister for Defence. While the Taoiseach is nominally the Minister for Defence, he has effectively subcontracted out the Department to a Minister of State. It is not good enough and it clearly indicates that the Government does not properly value and respect the Defence Forces. I am sorry to have to say this but this is the reality and it would be remiss of me to let this opportunity pass without mentioning it.  Five years ago, the Taoiseach got it wrong when he gave the same Cabinet Minister responsibility for justice and defence, despite it being a norm in democratic countries to separate political responsibility for the military and the police. He rectified that mistake in 2014 and I hope he rectifies this latest mistake at the earliest opportunity. Turning to the motion, Fianna Fáil is committed to strengthening the Defence Forces in terms of numbers and in capability. Part of this involves participation in battle groups, which we in Fianna Fáil support. We support this motion, just as we supported the motion last October. The participation of our forces in this battle group is far more modest than when Dáil approval was sought last year when 175 members were due to be involved. On this occasion, the Dáil is approving the involvement of five personnel. Participation in battle groups presents a valuable opportunity for our soldiers to enhance their skills and for us to maintain modern defence forces. Every time we participate in such a group, there are the usual warnings about our neutrality being undermined. We obviously do not accept this position. Any actual Irish participation in a battle group action can only take place under the same auspices as any other overseas participation - that the triple lock comes into play, namely, the approval of the Government, the Dáil and the mission being endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. Support for and retention of the triple lock prior to the deployment of the Defence Forces is a fundamental element of Fianna Fáil defence policy and we hope it is fully endorsed by the Fine Gael party in government. We have rightly given primacy to the UN since we joined more than 60 years ago. In that time, we have worked with other UN members to support international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, humanitarian actions and human rights implementation. We are strong and committed supporters of collective security through the United Nations. We have a long tradition of overseas service in support of UN or UN-mandated deployments in pursuit of international peace and security since the first Defence Forces deployment abroad in 1958 and the battle group continues this tradition. Thus far, of course, no EU battle group has deployed in a mandated mission. As Fianna Fáil has pointed out previously, overseas service deployments by the Defence Forces are a pivotal element of both Irish foreign policy and for the attainment of Defence Forces operational capability across a wide spectrum of challenging military, geopolitical and geo-strategic environments. Our Defence Forces personnel of all ranks have shined, and continue to shine, in overseas deployments. We are internationally recognised for the high quality of our Defence Forces members. The sustained participation of Defence Forces members is indispensable for individual and unit professional development, unit operational viability and cohesion. The nature of overseas deployments since 1958 has, of course, changed substantially over the decades and yet they have been perceived by the public as being mainly a form of "armed humanitarianism". There is, of course, far more to it than that. Military service, most particularly in the trouble spots of the world where the Defence Forces now deploy, is dangerous and challenging. We must always keep that in mind and that means that our military personnel need to be trained, armed, equipped, resourced, led and supported appropriately. My party and I are happy to support this motion, just as we are happy to support our Defence Forces in their endeavours on our behalf.

Bhí mé mar urlabhraí mo pháirtí ar cheisteanna cosanta ag amanna difriúla thar na blianta. The motion deals with Ireland's participation in the EU battle group, which is led by the UK and also comprises Cyprus, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden. It permits the Government to agree to the deployment of soldiers to an EU battle group meaning a contingent of our military personnel will form part of a battalion-sized force of 1,500 soldiers complete with the combat supports required.These are aptly named battle groups because they allow the EU to project its military might by retaining its capacity to rapidly deploy combat-ready troops to regions across the globe. Their primary purpose is to go into battle on behalf of the EU wherever post-colonial powers such as Britain decide such action is necessary. Can we imagine the EU going to war? Some people cannot, but there are warmongers in Europe and abroad who would be quick to embroil the EU and its countries in external wars. We only have to look at recent history to see occasions upon which similar warmongers wanted the EU to embroil itself in wars not of its making and not of major relevance to it. Recently, there were the disputes between Russia and Ukraine and Russian and Georgia. One should look at the history of some of the member states we would be joining in an EU battle group and the stance they took in Syria, Libya, Iraq and elsewhere in that region. They supposedly aligned themselves with democratic rebels, and we have seen the consequences of that in the world.  Ireland should have and has had quite an honourable tradition in the UN. We would be best placed to try to enhance our role in the UN and to work with it in peacekeeping, rather than enforcing peace or taking sides as the EU battle group would be doing in the future. We have a proud tradition and our soldiers have performed peacekeeping duties right around the world. All one has to do is look at the recent operations by our Naval Service and its contribution to the rescue missions in the Mediterranean to see the role our Defence Forces should have. They are aptly named the Defence Forces because their role is the defence of Ireland, not the defence of everywhere else in the world. We are a small nation and our Defence Forces have been starved of investment in many ways. In the rest of Europe there has been huge growth over the last number of decades, and spending on armaments has continued to grow. While we have seen famines and crises in terms of poverty throughout the world, those modernised countries that would have us invest money in a battle group are spending money that would save lives on increasing their armaments and their capabilities. That is the biggest disgrace of the concept of the EU battle groups. Rather than investing in the UN and its poverty eradication programmes or investing in the UN so it can become fully effective, we have aligned ourselves to those who would create another military institution similar to NATO and other Cold War institutions that should be gotten rid of. At this stage, the role of progressive states in the world should be to enhance the UN rather than undermine it by creating competing military complexes such as the EU battle groups concept.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	133	At a time like this, when we are debating and presumably voting on the allocation of five Irish soldiers to participate in a British-led battle group, which I presume will include British paratroopers - the Minister may be able to clarify that - we should remind ourselves of every time we raised the nature of the European Union in discussions. In debates about the Lisbon treaty and the prospect of the militarisation of Europe, we were laughed at and ridiculed. Straw men were put up saying that we were saying that everyone was going to be conscripted into a European army when nobody was saying that. These are battle groups; they are not peace groups. They are the ability of the European Union to put 50,000 troops on the ground anywhere in the world within five days. To what purposes can they be put on the ground? I will read the relevant section of the Treaty on the European Union, which says:The tasks ... in the course of which the Union may use civilian and military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks ... All these tasks may contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories.That was added by the Lisbon treaty and it broadens the definition of what battle groups can do. The fight against terrorism is the pretext du jour for imperialist interventions, led by France in Mali and others in the Middle East. Nobody goes to war anymore for colonial interest; they always go to war to prevent terrorism.  Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, a former secretary general of NATO said:EU Battle Groups could be used to go to war. Why did the EU create the Battle Group? It is not just to help rebuild a country. The Battle Groups are not for building schools. We should not think the EU is for soft power and NATO for tough power.There it is in black and white. That is how the military, political and economic establishment in Europe and around the world view these battle groups and it is a disgrace that the Government would propose, and the Dáil presumably would agree to, Irish participation in yet another battle group that can be used against so-called terrorism. Unfortunately, the Government and previous Governments make a lie of the idea of Ireland's neutrality. That happens in many different ways in terms of the battle groups. It also happens through the use of Shannon Airport. It is against the wishes of the vast majority of people in this country and we should reject the motion. We should not be participating in any battle groups whatsoever. 
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	134	In a debate on EU battle groups last year, the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, stated:Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected by our participation ... We are not and will not become part of any military alliance or permanent military formation. We will not enter into any mutual defence arrangement. How then do we explain Ireland's membership of the EU battle group or our partnership with NATO? Fine Gael, supported by Fianna Fáil, further ensured the Dáil that any deployment of an Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will be subject to the triple lock of the Government, the Dáil and a UN mandate before deployment occurs. How do we explain the fact that in May this year The Sunday Times reported that 300 soldiers from Ireland, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland and Sweden had taken part in 18 days of war games on Salisbury plain in England in an EU battle group led by the British army? If Dáil Éireann agreed in 2015 to the deployment of troops in an EU battle group led by Germany, how did we end up deploying troops in war games in a battle group led by the British army? If there is no Dáil oversight on decision making on deployment of troops to EU battle groups how can we trust in the ongoing commitment of the Government to provide the protection afforded by the triple lock? The ongoing alliance of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil with the military formations in the EU and NATO directly contradicts our neutrality, associates us with aggression abroad, particularly in the Middle East, and will endanger Irish troops who take part in genuine peacekeeping missions by undermining their claim to a genuine neutrality. Ireland should withdraw from the EU battle groups, NATO partnerships including the use of Shannon by the US, and, as Denmark has done, from further participation in US militarisation.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	135	The proposition before us is an affront to the concept of our neutrality. It is in line with other daily occurrences where we see the US military using our airport in Shannon in spite of our neutrality. We see other examples where Irish Defence Forces personnel are sent and kept in Afghanistan to support NATO led initiatives, its resolute support mission and so on. We are told that these initiatives are taken in countries like Afghanistan to ensure the security of the population and to support its Government. The reality is that our troops have been present in a country where the so-called Government has no mandate or say and which is divided between ISIS on the one hand and the Taliban on the other. We should have no hand, act or part in participating there, no more than we should have in the idea of participating in the EU battle groups.Initially, these groups were established with 1,500 combat soldiers assigned to each one. The point has been made that to allow for back-up on rotation, there were another seven to nine soldiers for each combat soldier so, in effect, a battle group is a military force of 12,000 troops. The numbers have extended from their original concept and the size has increased to more than 3,000. Given that two are made ready approximately every six months, in effect, the European Union is developing an armed force of almost 50,000 troops ready to be sent anywhere in the world. That is happy days for those in the arms industry who are the main beneficiaries of this situation. The record is well known that EU battle groups could be used to go to war. Why else would they have been established? Generally, they were initiated on the basis of being nationally based or made up of troops from adjoining countries, which would lead Britain to be the logical ally for Ireland in that context. However, Fianna Fáil was in power when this arose originally and it had a problem because the idea of Irish troops fighting alongside those from Great Britain was anathema at that time and could not be envisaged. Obviously, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael supported the Good Friday Agreement and believed that, eventually, the time would be right when this proposition could be considered. It is clear that the Government believes the time is right now. I am not a nationalist; I have no interest in nationalism. I am an internationalist and someone who believes profoundly in our neutrality. It does not matter to me whether we join a UK battle group, the Russian forces or the American forces. They are all the same as far as I am concerned but there is a certain irony in the idea that in 2016, we would align ourselves with a UK battle group 100 years on from when the likes of John Redmond sent 50,000 young Irishmen to be slaughtered in the First World War, as part of the British army. As a pacifist, I find that reprehensible. It is a fact that NATO and the EU battle groups are synonymous, one and the other. They are the new breed of enforcing imperial power and we, as a neutral country, should have no part in that whatsoever. We only have to read the words of the UK Minister of Defence in 2005, in a letter to the House of Commons, when he described the UK battle groups as being mutually reinforcing with the larger NATO Response Force, and having the potential to act as a stepping stone for countries that want to contribute to the NATO Response Force, by developing their high readiness forces to the required standard and integrating small countries' contribution to the multinational units. Wherever possible and applicable, standards, practical methods and procedures for battle groups are analogous to those defined in the NATO RF. Correctly managed, there is considerable potential for synergy between the two initiatives. That is what we are talking about and that is the end game in terms of these battle groups. A link between NATO and EU military formations is confirmed. The battle groups allow small countries, such as Ireland, to become integrated in those structures in a manner in which they would not be otherwise. Other EU countries like Malta and Denmark have no part in these formations. We should have no part in them either. I strenuously oppose the initiative.

My contribution will be short because I was delighted to read the Minister's statement, which clarified some issues for me, but as a former Minister for Defence, I am deeply concerned that our image as peacekeepers should not be damaged by any titles or otherwise. It is very unfortunate that this group is termed a battle group. On reading the Minister's speech, it is clear that it is an extension of our peacekeeping missions. I wanted to intervene to ask the Minister to ask that the title given to these groups should not be "battle groups" as it immediately sends the wrong message and causes alarm bells to ring unnecessarily in terms of the role these people will be asked to perform. We can argue here whether Ireland wants to be neutral or not. I believe strongly that Ireland should remain neutral. I strongly believe also that we can do more for peace in the world by upholding our great image and professionalism in peacekeeping. We have a peacekeeping college on the Curragh where people come from all parts of the world to learn about peacekeeping methods. That is vitally important for Ireland but it is very unfortunate that this group within the European Union should be entitled a battle group. If it is concerned with security and peacekeeping, that is different from a battle group. It rings alarm bells unnecessarily throughout the country, which is world renowned for its peacekeeping. The purpose of my contribution is solely to ask the Minister to indicate, when replying, if efforts could be made to change the title of these groups which will, in fact, be engaged in peacekeeping exercises.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	138	I move:That the amendments and additions to the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business contained in the Report of the sub-Committee on Dáil Reform regarding changes to Standing Orders (which was laid before the Dáil on 8th June, 2016) be adopted, with effect from the dates outlined in the report.I welcome the opportunity to support the motion before the House to amend Dáil Standing Orders on the basis of the final report of the Sub-committee on Dáil Reform that was established on the first sitting day of this Dáil. When this Dáil met on 10 March, an all-party motion establishing the committee, which was chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, was passed. The committee was established by consensus in this House and in the main for the last nine weeks it has worked by consensus. It was tasked with reviewing the way our Parliament works and identifying a set of reforms that could and will be introduced to strengthen it. In May the committee, after a number of detailed meetings, published a draft report, which was debated in this House.The committee met again following debate in the House to finalise the report. The members of the committee, who came from across the House, were very conscious of the issues raised by Members in that debate when they decided on the final report. The motion before the House today is a result of the work of 19 committee members from across the parties and groups in the Dáil who, under the able and patient chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle, worked over the last three months to review the way our Parliament works and to prepare a report which sets out, in detail, a package of reforms which I believe will radically change for the better the way the Oireachtas operates. The motion before the House today seeks to build on the reforms introduced in the past and to work to create a parliament which is more effective and more efficient. The fact that the general election this year produced a Dáil where no one party has a majority and where this Fine Gael led partnership minority Government is committed to working in partnership with all Members of the Oireachtas means that we need a new way of doing business. As a group of 158 Deputies elected by the people, we have a duty to ensure that this Dáil works. The proposed changes will empower the Oireachtas like never before. The changes will give our Parliament a stronger voice and make Government more accountable to it. The establishment of a Dáil business committee will give all Deputies a greater voice in the business of the Dáil and allow a fairer distribution of Dáil time between the Opposition and the sitting Government. The Dáil will establish stronger committees which will work in a better way with the Chamber. Oireachtas committee meetings and the Dáil plenary sessions will no longer clash. Oireachtas committees will now meet on Tuesday evenings and Wednesday and Thursday mornings with the Dáil sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons and evenings. The new split will finally end the problem of Oireachtas committees clashing with important debates in the Dáil and Deputies being forced to choose between the two or to run up and down the corridors and stairs of the House to try and make it in time for votes. The Dáil will enhance the legislative process in the Oireachtas. The Dáil will establish new structures for Leaders' Questions, Taoiseach's Questions, ministerial questions and Topical Issues. The Dáil will establish a fixed time each week for taking all divisions on Thursday afternoons and Members may formally abstain in a vote which will aid in achieving more family friendly hours and working conditions in the House. These reforms are a major step in the direction of creating an Oireachtas that is stronger and more representative of the people elected to it while allowing Government to carry on the work with which it is charged.

It was a pleasure to serve on that committee with a very diverse group of Deputies from across the House with different political backgrounds and different views on issues but all were focused on bringing about much needed and long awaited reform. It shows how well the committee worked that only once was it actually divided by way of a vote. I am not completely happy with everything in it, if I am to be honest, but there are significant changes proposed: the establishment of the budget oversight committee, an independent budgetary office established on a statutory basis; the office of independent parliamentary legal advice, again established on a statutory basis; and by fixing of the mess of the committees of the last Dáil and Seanad by making the committees sectoral and aligned to Government Departments and restricted to membership of 11 - seven Deputies and four Senators - so the committees will not have membership of 29 and 30 people where members cannot contribute properly. It will afford a much better representation of how the public voted in the general election to ensure that legislation can be passed from the Government or the Opposition side and that Bills will now no longer be allowed to die on the vine after passing Second Stage. Bills will now have to get to the next Stage within ten weeks of that passing. It is also important that the allocation of speaking time, oral and priority questions and Private Members' business is done on a proportionate basis to reflect the vote of the people in the last general election. In the main I would support all the changes to Standing Orders that are proposed on behalf of Fianna Fáil. I will wait to see how one or two items actually work in practice. The Ceann Comhairle has said, as have many others at the reform committee meetings, that this is not the end of Dáil reform. The reform committee will meet next week and again at the end of this Dáil session before the summer recess. The committee will remain in place to ensure the reforms being brought forward are working and where they are not working that they will be changed. It is open to the committee, at a future stage, to propose further amendments to Standing Orders should that be desirable or required at the time. I am extremely pleased with most of the proposed changes that have been brought forward. It is now the job of Members to work within this new reality. The rules are now changed to allow us to do so and the mindset of all Members needs to change also in how we operate within this Dáil. The Seanad met yesterday for the first day. It is important, and I have said this to the Ceann Comhairle, that Seanad reform is also required. The Oireachtas is not just the Dáil, it is the Dáil, Seanad and Uachtarán na hÉireann. The Seanad needs to be reformed and made further relevant. Fianna Fáil will support each of the Standing Orders as set out by the committee. I commend in particular the Ceann Comhairle on the efficient and inclusive manner in which he has chaired these meetings. I commend all of those who served on the committee. I found it to be a most interesting and, in the main, enjoyable experience. All of us know that the public want us to change the way we do business in the House and this report on Dáil reform and the changes being brought forward will bring us a step closer to that. However, we need to continue to ensure that we are committed to reform and to look at how the rules are working and where they are not working in order to change it. It is vitally important that the parliamentary legal advice office is staffed to its requirement as soon as possible to allow opposition Bills have the same weight as Government Bills and to be written and drafted to the same quality. Opposition Bills will pass through this Dáil and we have to ensure they stack up. That is a priority. The independent budgetary office is also a priority in order to change the way that our budget is formed and framed so it is not just one big hit in October and that the budget is more inclusive of all political views in the House.

Uaireanta ní thuigeann siad go díreach cad atá ar bun againn san áit seo. Déileáil an coiste go maith leis an gceist agus d'éirigh linn teacht ar shraith rialacha nua a chuideoidh linn an gnó atá le déanamh againn san áit seo a dhéanamh amach anseo. I hope that I contributed positively in my work with the committee on Dáil reform. I undertook the work diligently, put forward my own proposals and I listened to the proposals of others. The benefit of the committee was that people brought their practical experience of the House and those who were new to the House brought ideas. Some of us were able to tease the ideas out and show if they could work or not. Any change to the rules in this institution has consequences that are often unforeseen. The committee has managed to put together the first raft, hopefully, of changes which will benefit not only Members but also the public who will receive a more effective and efficient Dáil. Ba mhaith liom déileáil leis an gceist maidir leis an Ghaeilge sa Dáil amach anseo. Tá súil agam go gcomhlíonfar na moltaí atá déanta againn agus go bhfeicfimid níos mó reachtaíochta agus meamraim míniúcháin as Gaeilge ag teacht os ár gcomhair. Tá moladh déanta againn freisin go mbeidh coiste ann le déileáil leis an Ghaeilge agus is céim mhór chun tosaigh í sin. There are many issues that remain to be addressed and the commitment by the Ceann Comhairle that this is not the end of Dáil reform will hopefully be lived up to.I have been here long enough to hear of previous commitments, but I believe an Ceann Comhairle when he says that we will come back to some of the issues, because they are consequential on some of the changes. We are all eager to ensure what we have changed will work. I believe that in some instances there will be practical problems. For instance, the proposal for promised legislation allows for 15 minutes' discussion. If we take it that the Minister and a leader between them have two minutes and there are now eight groups, 16 minutes are already gone, meaning other Deputies will not get to speak on promised legislation on Wednesdays or Thursdays were all the leaders to take their slots. That is a practical problem but there are solutions and we will examine the issue again. Other practical problems have also emerged. I express my support for the amendment but if we accept Deputy Daly's amendment, other consequential changes need to be made. These changes relate to how political parties are registered, how a leader's allowance travels, whether he or she is in a political party and leaves or he or she joins a political party, the allocation of secretarial assistants and the allocation of committee chairs. If we accept this change, and I hope we accept it, these are all consequential steps to be taken to put in place a more robust recognition process which deals with political parties and the questions I raised. Further, we cannot have a situation where people are jumping in and out of parties. There needs to be a cooling down period. We need to get to grips with this quickly, because the public have told us who are in, if one wants, established political parties that there needs to be a change. They voted for small parties, big parties and also quite a number of Independents. Some of those Independents over time will join other parties or will stay independent. However, there are consequences and we should not put in place rules that restrict them or discriminate against them. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas arís leo siúd a d'oibrigh liom ar an gcoiste, ach go háirithe an Ceann Comhairle as an obair a rinne sé. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tairbhe le baint againn as amach anseo.

I think I am the first person to speak who was not a member. Therefore, on behalf of all Members, I thank those who served on the committee as well as the Ceann Comhairle for the work they did. I include in that regard my colleague and party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who unfortunately cannot contribute at the moment. This is very much an agreed package and we in the Labour Party will co-operate with it. That the business committee will be operating by consensus is important and will work to ensure we have a smooth running of business in this Chamber which works in the interests, above all, of the people we represent. It will in some ways take time to find its feet and we need to ensure we all co-operate from all sides to ensure it operates smoothly. As previous speakers stated, we want to ensure this is a working Dáil that does the business on behalf of the people. There has sometimes been some scepticism from the public around what goes on in here. I sincerely hope these changes will help to ensure it works well. The Chief Whip referred to the family-friendly aspect in her introductory contribution. This is important but, inevitably, there will have to be compromise. What is family-friendly to someone living in Dublin is not necessarily family-friendly to someone living in Kerry, Donegal or west Mayo. We have to find a compromise for people who live where I live, for example. We would probably like to start early in the morning on Wednesdays and Thursdays and finish late in the evening on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and get back to our constituencies as early as possible. For people living in Dublin, family-friendly is something different. Inevitably, therefore, compromise will be required. It is a national assembly so we have to find that balance and, overall, the committee has achieved it. There are other elements of the reform package, for example, the revamped legal services. These were also referred to by a previous speaker. These services are very important, particularly because we will now have Bills from the Opposition which will be able to travel more easily in the current configuration of the Dáil. It will be important that Members who are bringing Bills forward who are not members of Government and therefore do not have the legal advice of the Attorney General and legal sections of Departments have independent legal advice. This section is, therefore, very important, as are the budgetary office proposals. I understand, however, that they are the responsibility of the Oireachtas Commission rather than something for the Standing Orders. It will, therefore, be important that the Oireachtas Commission gets up and running. I do not know if the Chief Whip will be able to respond but there was a suggestion it might not meet until September. Will she provide clarity on the matter and confirm that it will meet as soon as possible in order that we can get these reforms up and running? I also support what Deputy O'Brien said about the committees and ensuring they are effective and work properly in relation to the various Departments and Ministers engaging with them on business and legislation. Certain powers are available to the Chair under these revised Standing Orders only when the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is in the Chair. Deputy Eugene Murphy is acting as Chairman now, but some of the powers cannot be exercised except by the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I, therefore, want to make the point again that we need to remedy the deficiency with regard to the election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Four Members were proposed last week but none of them succeeded in getting a majority in this House. We need to address that area. Overall, on behalf of the Labour Party and my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I welcome the Standing Orders before us today and indicate that we will be fully supportive.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	147	This is the third time I have spoken on this matter in this House. I participated in all the meetings of the committee on Dáil reform, so I do not have a whole lot to add at this stage. However, I add my voice to the thanks to the Ceann Comhairle and all the staff involved who did a huge amount of work in terms of turning around papers, proposals and draft Standing Orders at very short notice and translating difficult discussions into concrete proposals in black and white on which we could then decide. It was excellent work on their part. We are nearly finished the process of Dáil reform in terms of this particular set of packages. I agree that it has to continue but even within this package there are other bits and pieces to come in terms of the written explanation of votes and so on being added to Standing Orders. The Dáil reform committee was extremely limited by the basis on which it was set up. It was set up to examine Dáil reform, but we need something much more substantial. We need a radical change in terms of how our democracy works, with a real transfer of power to people. For example, such change could include an ability to initiate a referendum if a certain number of people sign a document or an ability for people to recall Deputies who break their electoral mandates and so on. What was attempted in the Dáil reform process? There was a pressure on all the parties, in particular the establishment parties, to reflect the reality of the election, the fact the two and a half party system we had in this country is gone and finished, that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael combined have less than 50% of the vote and the fact a number of small parties and Independents were elected. There was pressure on those people to have their voices heard in the Dáil. This effort was an attempt in that regard and it goes some way towards it, but we will need to review it. I would like to highlight some of the changes that I believe are important. The change to Leaders' Questions to allow for four questions per day is an important, progressive reform. It means all groups will be able to speak on a rotational basis. While it is not strictly relevant to Standing Orders I believe a time limit should be imposed in respect of Leaders' Questions such that the first couple of questions do not take up an enormous amount of time and thereby result in the third or fourth question not being taken. The ability to abstain is in a sense a small thing but it allows people to express themselves politically in a way that often cannot be done by a binary "Yes-No" system. People may feel the need to abstain and explain their reason for so doing. The business committee is important. Given the manner in which it is being set up in the Standing Orders, it is essential that the Government Chief Whip listens to what is being said by others at the business committee and takes it on board. Under Standing Orders as currently drafted, the business committee is required to get consensus on a Government proposal, or not, with dissent on the Government proposal going to the floor of the Dáil. While obviously under the current Dáil such a proposal could be defeated that might not necessarily be the case in future Dáil arrangements.  My next point relates to the business committee. Private Members' motions previously taken every second Friday will now be taken every Thursday, with motions for discussion to be chosen by the business committee. We should strongly encourage the committee to use the lottery system used previously as it is the fairest way of operating. I would like finally to comment on some of the points of controversy that arose at the end of the process. One of the questions that arose was whether it is correct that political parties take precedence in order of speaking to groupings that are not political parties. I maintain that it is correct. I believe that people stand on a political mandate. As a member of a party they stand on a national mandate. As they receive votes from all over the country their mandate is a national one. I do not believe they should get additional time or rights but I do believe they should take precedence over technical groupings of Independents. Linked to that is the question of whether that precedence can be trumped by people moving between groups or from a non-group to a political grouping following an election. I think it is correct for us to place a premium on the expression of the will of the people, be that through a general election or a by-election, and to say that this determines the order of speaking rights. I believe that is appropriate and that it gives due weight to the role of the electorate in choosing on the basis of the mandate that people seek and the programmes on which people stand to order parties in a particular way.

The general principles in the reform document have been broadly discussed here and broadly welcomed. The initiative of the grouping was positive. On the last occasion this issue was before the House, the point was made that in some ways the reforms go a good bit of the way towards reflecting the new political reality in that they transfer power from the Government to the Oireachtas, which is welcome. Interestingly, during the last debate in the House on this issue a large number of Deputies made the point that they only go a bit of the way because the current system still serves to guard and protect the privilege of parties, which to me is inherently undemocratic. It is inherently archaic and is hankering after an old system that is unravelling not only in Ireland but across Europe.  It is ironic that the people who made the point about an electoral mandate and a national mandate are members of the small groupings which comprise only a small number of Deputies. The larger parties did not tend to make that point because the national mandate was evident in the number of seats those parties got. In that sense, size does matter. In this matter, it is decisive. I am glad that this is being reflected in the concept of proportionality. It is accurate that this be done. What was being put forward by the groups was that in giving parties precedence it was not just parties that were being given precedence but parties with more than five members elected. For example, the Green Party could have a national vote in excess of that of the AAA-PBP but because it does not have as many Deputies it would not get party precedence, even though it could be argued that it has a greater national mandate. It is a nonsense.  The effect of these Standing Orders is to deal with an evolving situation and a new type of politics. I would like in that context to comment on the groupings. A mistake was made, in particular at the last meeting, to rush in changes to Standing Orders based on the arithmetic from this Dáil for narrow, petty, sectarian interests over the interests of what a Standing Order should be, which should be to deal with the business of the Dáil in a fair and transparent manner. I would like to thank the AAA-PBP, Fine Gael and the Labour Party for having such confidence in us that they are bothered to spend so much time trying to put us down the pecking order. We are flattered. I do not propose to focus on that issue now.  The scenario we are seeking to address by way of the amendment before us is the insertion of a particular section in the last minute of the last committee meeting. It is clear to me that this goes against the slant of Standing Orders, which is to facilitate the formation of groups. It is inherently undemocratic and negative in that it is being put forward to stymie people rather than do anything positive. In effect this means that if a party was to split and a large number of its members were to form a group which is larger than the party under the umbrella of which the original party was elected, then the latter group will rank lower and behind a Technical Group in the pecking order because it was not a party elected at the time of the election. Let us take the example of the Labour Party. Many people would argue that the Labour Party broke its national electoral mandate by going into Government on the last occasion. If a majority of Labour Party Deputies wanted to leave the Labour Party and form a larger group than the one they left, the latter group would be behind the original Labour Party which did not adhere to its electoral mandate. Another unintended problem is the fact that if as Deputies are saying the addition of new members cannot alter precedence then the opposite also applies in that a party cannot lose precedence as a result of it. We could have a situation whereby if a party of 50 people splits and 45 of them go one direction and the remaining five stay with the original party, the latter group will be higher up in the pecking order, which is a nonsense. Let us call a spade a spade. We all know why this proposal was put forward. It is not a good way of doing business. It goes against the grain of the type of approach that was adopted quite successfully on a range of issues. It is petty and it has no place in any Parliament setting or under Standing Orders. It is in that regard the amendment is proposed.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	150	There is an incremental approach to bringing forth Standing Orders as drafted. I, too, pay tribute to the people who make a complex issue appear easier to deal with than it is, in particular Noreen Banim who is one of the people who worked behind the scenes on the set of Standing Orders with which we are dealing today. The business committee will be up and running fairly soon. I believe this committee will be pivotal in reflecting the change of power in terms of that power being shared among Parliament as opposed to residing with the Government, with the Opposition having only influence in particular matters. There is a big difference between influence and power. It is in this regard we will see reform manifest itself. To allow this to play out all of the committees will need to be up and running. There is a real problem in terms of the size of this Dáil, which is almost a converse of the previous Dáil which comprised a large Government and a small Opposition. The reverse is now the case. This means it will be difficult for the Government to fill all of the positions on committees. We may well end up with a situation whereby members of the Opposition who want to be members of particular committees will be unable to be so.We have to find a way to reduce the amount of negative energy that might create. When writing Standing Orders we have to ask ourselves where we get our authority from. We get it from the people and the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution do the words "political party" appear. I have spoken on numerous occasions over the past five years on this point. Despite now being in a party, I have not changed my view. The mandate is given to the individual who stands for election. Sometimes the person stands within a political party system, sometimes as an Independent. The people decide who should fill the seats in this Chamber. The Standing Orders as they are written favour the party as having a preferred mandate. That is wrong. It will add another layer, if not two, of co-ordination that will make it very difficult to run this House. Some of the offices of the House are finding that there is additional work they had not anticipated in the temporary mechanism for co-ordination. Co-ordination in the first instance will be within the groups. Then there will be co-ordination between the groups and between the groups and the Government. That will make running this House much more difficult. The way it has been designed, favouring the parties over big groups, means that, instead of big groups coming together and co-ordinating, there will be a more fragmented arrangement with many small groups, making that much more difficult. I had some experience of that having been the Whip for the Technical Group, which worked pretty well in the last Dáil. There were 17 or 18 Members in it and no one missed Private Member's business or Leaders' Questions while Priority Questions were routinely taken. Members also sat on committees. The way it is being done here creates unnecessary fragmentation. I take Deputy Paul Murphy’s point about the reforms. They are reforms of the way we run this House but there are political reforms that need to be considered, for example, the Social Democrats put forward the idea of an anti-corruption agency, instead of having tribunals and commissions of investigation after the fact. There is a better way to do it and that is one of our suggestions. It is an example of what could be done if political reform was captured, as opposed to just Dáil reform, which is welcome but is only half way towards what is needed.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	153	We are discussing the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill on which we will vote at some point. The headlines surrounding the setting up of the board is that taxpayers will be protected from bailing out banks in the future and that the mistakes of banks will not be borne by the public. It has been said that under the new system bondholders rather than taxpayers will be on the hook for losses with the creation of a single resolution board. We are told that underpinning it will be a special system of rules to prevent a failure from spreading panic across the financial system. Ireland will contribute €1.8 billion and the total fund will be €55 billion when completed. The intention is that it will be a nest egg to protect us. The scheme is presented as a way of defending us against future bankruptcy or bank failure. However, when one looks at the figures, the sum of €55 billion is small fry. This State, which relatively speaking is a small one, coughed up €64 billion alone in bailout funding. Let us look at the cost of bailouts elsewhere. In the United Kingdom it cost £133 billion to save the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, and the United States spent $430 billion bailing out Citigroup and others. Therefore, the fund appears very flimsy when one considers the potential costs of the failure of a major banking institution. One could ask who would believe for a minute that it would protect our system from bank failure. Even on its own terms the system will not work. The ECB has been pumping €80 billion into the European financial system every month to try to get the banks to lend. The idea behind its approach is that the money will move from the ECB into the banks and on to businesses and households, thereby increasing demand and helping the economy to recover but
the reality is that much of the money is ending up being used for speculation as banks borrow to buy shares and currencies and anything else that will help improve their bottom line. If and when another crash comes, €1.8 billion will be quickly swallowed up and the State will be asked to pay out again.Funding this therefore sets an extremely dangerous precedent. Members should vote to make the banks responsible and if they do not have it, it should be the bondholders and speculators that are hit and not the ordinary taxpayer again. More important, Members should now be taking real steps to rein in the banks and the bonus culture that still goes on. I also am struck by the rhetoric of the Government and the Ministers about this Bill, which is that the fund is unlikely ever to be used and that this is just a technical Bill. They state it is highly unlikely to ever be used as the banks now are well capitalised etc. I am sure this sounds familiar to the people because it is the same rhetoric as before the crash. Moreover, the Government told people that such and such a bank - I will not say its name - was too big to fail, that it would pose a systemic threat to the economy, that the ATMs would close and the sky would fall in. Is this fund really going to stop the same thing from happening again for the same reasons? Will the Government and its Ministers not be terrified about burning the bondholders, about creditors going on strike, about market sentiment, the whole nine yards of capitalism etc.? The last crash was not caused by liquidity or well-capitalised banks and I do not believe the next one will be either. Moreover, I do not believe the threat of taking 8% of a bank's liabilities before it could seek public funds will be much of a protection for taxpayers or the State. Members have been asked to put in place a taxpayer-funded additional insurance scheme for banks, that is, for private banks and for the private sector, which is the sector the Minister and his party constantly eulogise as being the engine of growth and innovation. Members of course cannot do the same for health, education, housing, transport or the environment, as that would be subject to strict guidelines and they would be breaking all the European Union rules. Apparently, however, they can do it for the banks. Members are being asked to vote to potentially give yet more funding over to private banks that make money from speculating and taking risks. The amount certainly is significant, not in banking terms but in other terms, as €1.81 billion would pay for approximately 70,000 new nurses or teachers. It would open schools or three children’s hospitals and could build more than 10,000 houses. Deputy Wallace probably has better figures and one probably would get more houses out of him for the same money than the figures I have quoted. Before the crash, the Irish banks were making astronomical profits for some of the wealthiest people in the country. Even during the time of the Celtic tiger - this figure is amazing - they made profits of €1 billion per year and together with the Irish developers, they effectively had families in a vice grip. They sometimes handed out 110% loans or 150% loans, thereby pumping billions of euro of extra demand into the housing market and helping to fuel even higher housing and property prices. But the profits here will remain private and all that is public are the losses and the potential losses. This Bill is yet another part of the process of nationalising losses while ensuring profits remain private. Despite the lessons we have claimed to learn about the crisis, it is the same old story, that is, it is socialism for the rich and capitalism for the rest of us. This brings me to the need to consider this venture. Given the extent of the crash and the €64 billion Irish taxpayers put into the ECB and the EU, I note how destructive it is to let banks do their own thing and lend recklessly without a safety net. This is where the Single Resolution Mechanism is supposed to kick in with banks being brought under a single system for an orderly wind-down in the case of problems. Put simply, this is an insurance system for future reckless behaviour and the taxpayers are being asked to put up the policy, that is, the very people who never benefited from the bonus culture and the recklessness in the first place. It is a bit like if a boy racer crashed his car and forced the costs onto his parents - which would be an awful thing to do – only for them then to be told by him that he was going to continue to speed and continue to crash and they would be obliged to put up the insurance premium to meet that behaviour, which would be obscene. Why are Members not making the bankers pay for their own insurance and, more important, why are they not enacting legislation now to claw back all the money that was pumped into the Irish bank system for which the taxpayers paid? I am not convinced that the culture of banks and how they make profits has changed or will change. I am not convinced that the bonus culture is finished or that caps on bonuses will stay or be around for long enough for them not to regain the reward. For example, Members are aware the cap on bankers' earnings of €500,000 in pay still is in existence. They know that Richie Boucher of Bank of Ireland gets €840,000 a year and know there is constant bleating from banks about the need to reward their staff and to incentivise their entrepreneurs. Consequently, I am not convinced the culture has changed or that lessons have been learned.  Nor am I convinced the risk of banks failing has gone away. Members are told that all this is to ensure that something like that can never happen again and that we, as regulators, and the banks have learned their lessons. In reality, banks are even bigger and more opaque than they ever were and they continue to trade in highly risky and financially rewarding products, just as they did before the crash. Consequently, the volume of derivative trading worldwide has reached more than $700 trillion. Sometimes the figures are mind-boggling but Members should take note of that figure, namely, that derivative trading worldwide amounts to more than $700 trillion, which is ten times the size of the world's real economy. It stood at $648 trillion in 2011 and probably is even higher now. According to one report in Forbes magazine, “The market has grown so unfathomably vast, the global economy is at risk of massive damage should even a small percentage of contracts go sour". Alongside this, one can see the growth of shadow banking with vulture funds, a sector that thrives outside any regulation or State-sponsored insurance scheme and that makes up 25% to 39% of the total financial system. It is really scary to see where these firms are investing and the real estate and equity they are buying up around the place. I am sceptical about the ability of this fund to do what it is claimed to do and Members on this side of the House are sceptical about the right of this fund to be used to shore up profit-making for private institutions. The Irish rich are up to their necks in all of this and it is obscene that Deputies, the people’s representatives, are being asked to vote to potentially hand over more taxpayers' money to the reckless banks for reckless behaviour, were the economy to crash again. People Before Profit wishes to play a constructive role on this issue. We wish to socialise banking in the interests of the real economy and want all the money that was diverted away from schools and hospitals to be returned to the people by the private bankers. For this reason, we obviously will be opposing this Bill.

As I have 30 minutes, I was thinking of doing so at 3.30 p.m. The European Central Bank and European Union have inflicted a huge injustice on Ireland. Sadly, the Minister for Finance now wishes to compound it by getting Ireland to co-operate with the Single Resolution Board, which wishes to continue the current practice of regulating banks even though it is aware that banks are hiding losses from the regulator. Patrick Honohan has confirmed at various times that banks have hidden losses and also confirmed that it is difficult for regulators to ensure that banks are safe. It now is well recognised that the ECB was a major contributor to Ireland's banking crisis. In 2001, the ECB knew that banks were about to start hiding losses yet it simply stood aside to please bonus-hungry bankers, allowing them to amass substantial bonuses while destroying economies like Greece and Ireland. Members should not allow this to continue. In 2001, the ECB was aware that banks were going to hide losses but did nothing about it. It stated: "This approach would allow two criticisms associated with the current accounting standards to be overcome, notably that potential credit losses remain hidden until signs of deterioration are evident and that market participants have insufficient information about the interest rate risk profile of banks." In 2006, the ECB reconfirmed that the amortised cost system of accounting allowed banks to delay the recognition of losses. It stated "given that these assets could be accounted for at amortised cost – the actual recognition of a loss or an impairment of the assets may take longer to materialise". In 2001, the ECB and the European Union received warnings from a consortium of French banks and bank regulators that carnage would result. Does the Minister of State agree with the local authority pension fund in London which stated that financial statements of banks and their regulation must be comprehensively reviewed?Its report stated:The Forum’s analysis as set out in this publication leads to some radical conclusions, not least the need for a comprehensive review of financial reporting where we believe there are significant deficiencies. Yet, in reaching this view, we are driven solely by a desire to understand how major financial institutions appeared, on paper, to be solvent at one moment, only to require enormous taxpayer support at the next, just to survive.Mr. Michael Buckley, a former chief executive of AIB, told the banking inquiry that 99% of bankers knew that the practice of hiding losses would cause difficulty. Mr. Buckley is not alone in this view. Bank of Ireland also knew that the rules were a disaster. Its former group chief financial officer, John O'Donovan, stated:Once the EU adopted IFRS and by extension IAS 39, Bank of Ireland had no choice, as a listed entity, but to apply the new standard. Bank of Ireland understood the pro cyclical nature of loan loss provisioning under IAS 39, was not entirely comfortable with its outcomes but there was nothing the Regulator/Central Bank or indeed the Court or management of Bank of Ireland could do to change what had been adopted by the EU. The list of those criticising banks for hiding losses is never-ending. Even the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board confirmed that its members were hiding losses and, therefore, not showing the financial position correctly.  In April, I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance asking for his views on claims by the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board that accounting standard IAS 39 forces banks to portray an inaccurate financial position. I further asked for his views on his assurances provided in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 185 of 14 February that banks had not systematically overvalued loans in their published accounts, which could be misleading. I asked the Minister to make a statement on the matter. He replied:I have answered a number of Parliamentary Questions in the past in relation to rules adopted by banks when valuing assets including loans. These rules are determined by the relevant accounting standards and it is the responsibility of the directors of the respective banks to ensure these rules have been properly applied. To provide assurance that this is the case, the proper application of the rules is subject to an annual independent external audit review. As I have stated in the past, nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that these rules have not been correctly applied by the banks. In February 2014, when Deputy Pearse Doherty asked the Minister for Finance if the Central Bank had ever investigated any bank in the State for hiding losses in its accounts, Deputy Noonan replied: "I have been advised by the Central Bank that the Bank is not in a position to provide me with a response to this question." It is not very satisfactory.  I believe that these statements, along with the Single Resolution Board, are an attempt to protect the bonuses of destructive bankers who have caused such huge losses to the Irish economy. I also have a legal opinion confirming that the practice of hiding losses is a potential criminal offence. I believe that by making misleading statements, the Minister is representing the interests of bankers and their lobby groups. Speaking of criminal offences, I have just written to the Central Bank to report possible criminal offences under the Market Abuse (Regulations) 2005 by the former NAMA committee member Frank Cushnahan and former NAMA executive officer Ronnie Hanna. Both men were arrested in Northern Ireland last week.  The NAMA code of conduct-----

We do not have a very good record of holding banks to account. Not only did we rescue them when they collapsed, but we have not been able to tell them what to do since. If I had a site today that I owned fully and I had planning permission for 30 houses on it, I would not get money - and neither would anyone of my size, for that matter - to build on the site. The pillar banks are not lending, and that is one of the problems we have in the delivery of housing. The Government argues, and I have often heard it argued here, that the State should not be interfering with private businesses such as banks. First of all, I do not agree with that and, second, AIB is State-owned. The idea that a state has no control over or does not hold to account private institutions that work within that state does not stack up. It really does not make any sense. I will not name the individuals again, but the gentlemen I referred to both worked for NAMA. Is anyone even remotely concerned about the fact that they have been arrested by the National Crime Agency? The notion that these guys were only involved on the sale side has just been blown out of the water. The National Crime Agency is not investigating the sale side; it is looking at the purchase side of Project Eagle. We have the same attitude to NAMA as we have to the banks. It is as if we do not want to know, and they can do what they like. This is incredible. I guarantee that, in time, this is going to fall down around their ears. I have not said anything close to the full amount of information as we have around this whole area because I have been short of paper proof sometimes. I can tell the Minister of State, however, that the way NAMA operated left a lot to be desired, and it will be proven in time. The fact that it has nothing to say about the fact that the two gentlemen were arrested last week is mind-boggling. Why is the Government not asking them to come to the House and explain why this happened? Am I missing something? It just does not stack up. I do not know what way the Minister of State sees it. Over the last year, I have brought NAMA up eight times on Leaders' Questions and, every time, NAMA spokespersons came out and contradicted most of what I said. They said I was not being accurate, even thought I was. Most of what I said has been borne out slowly. This time they have nothing to say, which is very interesting. How can they defend the role that these two gentlemen played in this transaction?  Last autumn, I asked NAMA how it could still engage with Cerberus on Project Arrow, given the fact that it is part of a criminal investigation in the North by the National Crime Agency and is being investigated in America by the Securities and Exchange Commission. How can it still deal with that organisation? Does the Minister of State know what NAMA said back to me? "As far as we are concerned, we have no evidence that Cerberus are being investigated under any criminal charges." Last week, when the National Crime Agency arrested our two friends, it said this was part of a fraud investigation. The last time I checked, a fraud investigation has a strong connection to criminal activity. Am I right?I am getting my interpretations or words wrong if that is not true. It said that this is a fraud investigation. What will the Irish Government do about it? Is it going to wait? Nobody might be charged for 12 months and if it was in the South, it could be even 18 months. Are we going to stand idly by and wait that length of time? I am not saying that we shoot the two individuals but it is about time we checked things out. Has it bothered the Government that enforcement against Northern Ireland borrowers who were in Project Eagle was less than 30% of the enforcement against Republic of Ireland borrowers? How is it that Republic of Ireland based borrowers appear to have been far more aggressively treated than those in Northern Ireland? I am sure most Members saw the last "Spotlight" programme in which Frank Cushnahan said to Mr. Miskelly that only for Ronnie the lights would have been put out. Does it not bother anybody that he said that? Maybe he made it up. I doubt it but maybe he did. I am not saying it is a fact, even though I have good reason to believe it is. However, why do we not investigate it? Do we not want to know exactly what happened? This speculation surrounding the work of NAMA will not go away. There will be speculation about how NAMA has operated until kingdom come unless it is investigated. NAMA does not have to be accountable for what it does. Its representatives were able to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in July and October 2015 and say what they wished. That is no disrespect to any member of that committee. I am not saying that if I had been a member of it I would have been able to hold them to account. I would not. It is not a body that can hold them to account. They can say what they wish and we cannot prove them wrong unless we hold an investigation. To date, however, we have not wished to conduct one. Will that remain the case? During his employment at NAMA as head of asset recovery, how many connections did Mr. Hanna approve enforcement against? If it has been found that he has not behaved quite how he should have, it has huge repercussions for all of the transactions in which he was involved with NAMA. It is important that we look at this sooner rather than later. If Cerberus is found to have behaved badly in Project Eagle, what will happen to all of the deals Cerberus has done in the South? It has bought more than €20 billion par value worth of assets on the island of Ireland. There is huge activity with it either looking for its money, selling on assets, trying to sell loans and so forth. Will all of this stack up? Will it unravel if Cerberus is found to have behaved badly? I believe it will. We will save ourselves a great deal of hassle by starting early rather than late. Kicking this can down the road will cost the State a lot of money. I suggest that we establish a commission of investigation sooner rather than later. The Government should initiate it and should not wait until more pegs fall and it all becomes overbearing. Why not start now and do the State a favour? If this is allowed to drag on until somebody is charged, many things will happen in the meantime. NAMA is already considering selling Project Ruby, Project Emerald and Project Abbey. If Cerberus buys more of these, the problem will be amplified if it is found that it has not behaved well. Given the way everybody was carrying on, it was as if Cerberus was always going to get away with this and that NAMA was always going to get away with whatever it did and would never be held to account.

I accept your guidance. I checked this out with a legal individual in Dublin who assured me that what takes place in that jurisdiction is legally disconnected from what happens in this one from that point of view. There is no problem there. I have been interviewed by the National Crime Agency at length on two occasions, in August 2015 and in March 2016, and I can assure the House that it is not hearing anything new today. Trust me on that. I am very hopeful that the National Crime Agency will deal with this affair in the manner in which it should. I am confident that it seeks the truth and I will continue to believe that until proven otherwise. My appeal today is that the Government take action. There is more bad news coming down the tracks for NAMA. It will get a great deal worse before it gets better. The Government should act now. This has been ongoing for more than a year and the Government has stonewalled most of what I have said in this Chamber. I have asked so many questions it is not funny but I do not believe I received one answer from the Taoiseach or the former Tánaiste on NAMA. I got some answers from NAMA. I know now that some of them, to put it politely, are seriously inaccurate and will prove to be so. This matter will not go away. I am not seeking to be sensational. I could mention another dozen names of whom the Minister has not heard but I will not do it. However, I will quote from a letter that Cerberus sent to the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, one week before closing the deal on Project Eagle. It outlines the nice cosy relationship it was offering: "Cerberus will release personal and corporate guarantees as a key part of consensual workout plans with cooperative borrowers." That related to when it would take over Project Eagle. It was quite confident it was going to get it because it was not a competitive process. It was the only body in the game. The letter continues:Cerberus' underwriting of the Loan Books has not, to date, included the value of any assets other than the direct collateral assets securing the loans, and as mentioned above we would be willing to waive guarantees for cooperative borrowers who agree to execute a consensual workout plan. Assuming the applicable borrowers cooperate in good faith in connection with such a workout plan and their agreement regarding a consensual restructuring transaction, any and all contingent liabilities and or personal guarantees from the Borrowers would then be released in accordance with the terms of the plan. Consequently, only the assets which are the principal subject or collateral for the underlying debt would be retained as security. The existing guarantees would be released so they would no longer be an impediment to borrowers or grantors from undertaking new business ventures.It would have been lovely if the Irish people who ended up with Cerberus had received that offer. A different game has been played out in the North. What happened there is that a deal was done in advance behind closed doors.When Cerberus paid 27 pence in the pound for Project Eagle, with the other 73 pence being picked up by the Irish people in the South, it knew what it would get for the assets because the whole thing was sorted well in advance. It stinks to high heaven. It could offer a cosy deal like this because it was not a competitive process. It had people working for it in Dublin and the North to make sure this was one of the great deals of all time. That is a fact.

While various Departments have responsibilities in the area, I want to ensure that we have an effective approach across all sectors. In recent weeks, I have met with representatives from a range of organisations, including Focus Ireland, Threshold, the ISPCC, and the Peter McVerry Trust. Those meetings provided me with a valuable opportunity to become acquainted with those working directly with families who are homeless and to gain an insight into the key issues facing children who are in emergency accommodation with their families. Based on these discussions and those with the relevant statutory agencies, I am seeking to define a set of measures to better support children with their families in emergency homeless accommodation. I am committed to developing the most appropriate policy responses in conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues. My Department and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, have responsibility specifically for child welfare and protection concerns. The accommodation needs of children who are in the care of their parents, where the family is homeless, is the responsibility of the local authorities. Tusla is very much aware of welfare issues for families and has engaged in multi-agency working on this issue. Close working between agencies is vital. Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive are shortly to sign off on a joint protocol which includes guidance on working with families where child protection concerns arise within emergency homeless accommodation. I anticipate that the protocol will be in full operation this month. Tusla has also appointed a homelessness liaison officer to lead on its engagement with homeless services, particularly in respect of child protection issues. I will work closely with my colleagues in government and with all relevant agencies to ensure that we address this issue as a matter of major importance.

I am delighted that she referenced the role of the local authorities because on reading my brief, I could not believe that there was no role for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in respect of homelessness and local authorities. This is a major concern throughout the country, not just Dublin. We must look at taking Tusla into that because there are serious welfare issues. While there might not be child protection issues, there are welfare issues because there are profound effects on the development of homeless children in terms of access to school, the GP, the family and the social network. It even affects simple things like play dates. During a meeting of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, we heard about how one mother had to take four bus journeys to get her child to school. She could not afford the return journeys so she stayed there all day. The Department needs to work very closely with the local authorities.

The Deputy focused on local authorities. I know that Tusla is very concerned about ensuring that it works closely with local authorities. In addition, I had a meeting with the director of Tusla in order to look again at some of the measures it has put in place to be proactive in its care for homeless children. I have already mentioned the homelessness liaison social worker. An education welfare liaison role will replicate the education welfare home-school liaison service. A person has been identified and Tusla is working to get them in place. In addition, family resource centres provide a ready infrastructure to support families and are proposing a greater mapping of these vis-à-vis the locations where the families are being housed so that they can provide a more specific outreach to the families. Two organisations funded by Tusla within its existing budget are also coming together to provide a package of summer projects for children living in emergency accommodation.

I welcome any intervention the Minister can make in terms of giving it an active role to play in respect of children in emergency accommodation. According to an article in The Irish Times on 24 May 2016, more than 1,000 children are in emergency accommodation. I hope the Minister agrees that we can push this forward because Tusla has an important role to play in this area. In the past, it had a more dormant role in respect of homelessness and working with local authorities. I am glad to hear the Minister say that she is looking at appointing different people. We need to look throughout the entire country in our appointments.

This is what I would like to see as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Tusla plays a significant role in that regard. My officials and I also held a meeting with the Minister for housing, planning and local government and his officials this morning. We are looking to add significant value to the action plan for housing he is developing, particularly in respect of a chapter on children and homelessness that covers not just the policy commitments, but the actions in that action plan in which we will be involved. We have an ethical obligation to do more. We are trying to develop a whole-of-Government approach and will focus on family homelessness as well as young people in aftercare.

The programme is designed to improve school attendance and participation of young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage.It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 37,000 children. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has had operational responsibility for the school completion programme since 1 January 2014, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2016, Tusla allocated €24.7 million to the programme.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Economic and Social Research Institute reviewed the programme on behalf of Tusla and its report was published in October 2015. Tusla has taken a number of actions to address the findings of the review and to strengthen the operation of the programme for the future. It is a very important priority for me, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to improve attendance and participation in education, particularly for vulnerable children. The programme for Government commits to publishing a new school completion strategy to improve school completion rates further, particularly in disadvantaged areas. I will work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills in developing the new strategy and in the context of the Government programme commitment to a new action plan for educational inclusion. The aim is to secure good educational outcomes for all children, especially those who are at risk of educational disadvantage. The Government will consider further investment in the provision of supports for young people at risk of educational disadvantage in line with the programme for Government commitments and in the context of the annual Estimates and budgetary process. I hope to be in a position to bring forward recommendations in that regard.

I am very encouraged that the Minister is saying that supporting school completion will be a big priority of hers in this Government. As we all know, education is a hugely important tool in tackling disadvantage and taking people out of poverty. I am aware that the funding in 2016 was €24.7 million. However, the funding for that programme in 2010 was €31 million per annum and even at that level it was not an enormous figure. It has been reduced in recent years and I know the Minister would agree that these are young people who are among the most at risk in our society and who rely heavily on education in terms of their future prospects. These are some of the most vulnerable children and some of them are currently destined to be failed by an underfunded system. They face enormous pressures that are dissimilar to those faced in many other schools in the ordinary day-to-day classroom setting and they should be funded adequately if we are to get serious about preventing people falling through the cracks. This is a project and funding stream that needs to be expanded on. I am somewhat encouraged by the Minister's comments but it is absolutely essential the funding is increased.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	171	I assure the Deputy that I absolutely share his deep concern on this issue. The issue is our children and especially those who may not have had the same kind of start that the Deputy, I or others in this Chamber have had. There was a section on funding in the ESRI review of the school completion programme. I am aware that there has been widespread dissatisfaction with the current level of funding at local level and that the impact of cuts in this programme has resulted in reduced provision in the context of growing needs. I do not find that acceptable but, having said that, reductions in funding have been applied proportionately across clusters but this does not necessarily reflect the level of need and the concentration of greater disadvantage in some local areas. Currently they say there is a lack of clarity about how funding is and should be divided within clusters with many arrangements reflecting historic decisions rather than need. I will take this into consideration when I am looking at this issue.

There is much to consider and I am very glad the Minister is taking the detail of the ESRI review into account. This programme is being aimed at school attendance and is targeted at those deemed to be at risk, generally coming from a particularly marginalised and impoverished community. In that context, does the Minister consider that proposals currently in the public sphere to link child benefit to school attendance are counter-intuitive when one considers that the children who are diverted into the system tend to be there to support school attendance and are usually there due to insufficient support? It is a ridiculous proposal that children like this should suffer indirectly by linking child benefit to school attendance. In the last week a Minister has again floated this proposal. Many of these children come from homes that experience a plethora of issues and social disadvantages. There seems to be some ambiguity on Government benches on this proposal. I would appreciate it, as many in the sector would, if the Minister could clarify the Government's position on it and whether the Government will rule out any possibility of linking the two, which I think should happen.

I referred to this issue earlier in the debate on the Adoption (Amendment) Bill because it came up in that context. As I said then, I am aware of the fact that we have a commitment to reform the monitoring of child benefit payments by amalgamating school attendance monitoring systems in order to address poor attendance within some families. That is contained in the programme for Government. As my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, indicated in response to some questions on this issue, he, Deputy Bruton and I have talked with our Departments, and I have talked to Tusla, to see if looking at the reform of the monitoring of child benefit would be an effective tool to ensure the school attendance of our children. To date, what has come back is that it will not be an effective tool and we are listening to that advice. That is not to say that I will not continue to have discussions. The Deputy is aware that my colleague, the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources, Deputy Denis Naughten, has put forward some of these proposals. I will discuss and listen to him in that regard but as far as I am concerned I am listening to Tusla and the other Departments. It is not about cutting child benefit; it is about making sure all children who need our help with school attendance are given it. It is especially through the school completion programme that we can focus on that.

It is a time-bound, co-funding arrangement with resources of €29.7 million from 2013 to 2017. It aims to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage and to mainstream in existing services those interventions that have been most effective. A broad range of interventions have been trialled across all 13 ABC sites and from these, interventions which are supported by the best evidence of impact will be identified and the learning disseminated. My Department committed to aligning all 13 ABC programme grant recipients and ensuring that effective services provided in each area can be supported until mid-2017. We have committed to the provision of an additional €400,000 to each of the three initial sites in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, in this context. I know those sites very well in terms of my own professional experience. I want to ensure that the learning from these effective interventions in the ABC programme is harnessed and mainstreamed into existing services. We are developing plans to enhance prevention and early intervention in children’s services. Future decisions will be informed by an examination of evaluation results already available from previous work, an evaluation currently being undertaken by the Centre of Effective Services and recommendations by a group that is helping to mainstream the learning from the most effective activities. My officials are working to ensure coherent strategic next steps for prevention and early intervention in Ireland. This is an area I have been promoting and committed to for the past 15 years of my professional life.

One of them I am aware of is Young Ballymun but, needless to say, I have concerns. The €400,000 being released is for another 12 months but I am concerned as to whether that is enough for what we intend to do. This started in 2007 when the philanthropists got involved and funding of €15 million was provided. The project in Ballymun, which I am only using as an example, has not got to completion. When we talk about what we need to do in the area based childhood, ABC, programme in terms of early intervention, we must see it as a cycle from preschool through to the school completion programme, and I do not believe we have done that. I would like to believe we have a long-term plan in regard to any of the 13 centres, of which ten are in Dublin. We need to have a plan. The people who are providing the service for children in impoverished areas need to know that the Government has a long-term plan for delivery and that it is not just for the next 12 months. We should not be "Sellotaping" from year to year while wondering about funding. We need to know that from the time they enter into the parental programme they are brought through to the early intervention programme, that they get involved in the breakfast clubs and the schools programme, to completion of the leaving certificate and that we get the family support put in place. The Minister is well aware of what they have done in Ballymun because it is her area. Coming from east Galway I am not as aware but I do understand that with any amount of intervention, be it from our health service or educational system, regardless of how little, we will reap the rewards in years to come. The Minister and I, and other Members of this House, can give these children their best start in life but we cannot penny-pinch from them at the very beginning.

Having a life cycle plan is a great idea. There needs to be greater planning in terms of linking that prevention in early intervention through to school completion to keep our young people in school, with all the supports that are provided for that. In that regard I, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department are responsible for providing services across that particular aspect of the life cycle. That is a great idea which I will bring it back to the Department. Perhaps it is already being implemented but it is something to consider, particularly in the context of the national youth strategy that has just been published.

I believe the Minister and I are on a similar page when it comes to early intervention from the cradle to getting them to the leaving certificate and then to college or on to the jobs market. That is what we need to consider, and that is where we need to deliver. There is common political will, which is the most important aspect. The child must be the centre of our focus at all times.

It is much more challenging when we do not necessarily have that kind of philanthropic support but I would be very much in favour of advocating for that. Regarding the 13 sites, one of the aspects we are looking at in regard to the evaluations is whether we should continue to fund all 13 sites at the same level. Should we only fund those sites in the context of what are deemed to be effective services? Are there other areas that also require that kind of funding? I assure the Deputy that I would be very committed to an area-based approach to the reduction of child poverty and encouraging the potential of our young people to achieve what they wish to achieve, whoever they are and wherever they come from.

The clarity she brought to the question on the linkage between child benefit and school attendance was very useful because we did not get anything close to that from the Taoiseach yesterday. My question is on the plans in the programme for Government to tender out public school facilities for use as after-school child care by community and other organisations. I am delighted that public schools are being used for this purpose because it is essential, particularly for parents, and lone parents, who are in work but I am concerned about the use of public schools for potentially private enterprise. Would the Minister not be better off looking towards a publicly funded model for publicly controlled child care facilities? There are many problems with the private model and I may come back to them once I have heard the Minister's response.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	183	I believe I understood the core of Deputy Smith's question but it is important to note that thousands of private providers currently deliver child care through publicly funded child care programmes including the early childhood care and education scheme, the training and employment childcare scheme and, since February of this year, the community childcare subvention programme. My Department is also currently developing a single affordable childcare programme that will enable any public investment in child care, be it for preschool or school-age children, to be directed to families through community or private child care providers. As the Deputy outlined, the programme for Government indicates that community groups and private providers will be invited to tender to use school facilities, outside school hours, for child care purposes. A cross-departmental group has now been established to consider how best to implement this commitment. Officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are developing a joint proposal for my consideration and the consideration of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton. As part of this work, the group will assess, and this is part of the Deputy's question, the many issues surrounding this commitment and the funding implications of implementing an after-school scheme for school-aged children. Matters to be considered by the cross-departmental group include the demand for services and the capacity to provide these, the development of an appropriate quality and standards framework and the development of criteria for the capital scheme providing €3 million in support for after school child care services to be funded by my Department as announced in budget 2016. In addition, the group will gather data, including the existing use of school buildings, and to consider collaborative models with existing community or private service providers. I am also undertaking with my Department consultations with children to identify what children like and dislike about after school care and to identify the places where children most like to be cared for after school. A report on that consultation will be submitted to me shortly and I have asked the cross-departmental group to consider the voice of the child as part of its deliberations.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	184	I welcome that response but I reiterate that all the research shows that low income families in particular find it difficult to access child care and the average family spends more than 25% of their take-home pay on child care, which is twice what is paid in the European Union. My sister raised her two children in Sweden where the child care facilities were second to none, but it was all publicly run and publicly funded. One paid a small amount into it but it was run by the local commune and it was an excellent facility. There was talk in the previous Government of moving to that kind of model because there are many problems with private child care. I do not know if the Minister is aware of a strike in Kilcoole, County Wicklow in a privatised child care facility called the National Childminding Association of Ireland, which is in receipt of €340,000 of the Department's money annually but which is forcing redundancy on long-term staff with between eight and 15 years' service and there is talk of replacing those staff members. That is not redundancy. If it is getting rid of staff it is because the jobs no longer exist. I will ask the Minister a direct question on that later but I am using that example to illustrate that problems can and do exist with private child care providers and we would like to see us moving to a publicly provided model.

I have done much work in the area over the years and even in community settings for providing child care where there is public money going in, it is still not enough for the people whose children need to be cared for in a fashion that is completely publicly subsidised child care. A very important start was the free preschool year and we are now moving to additional weeks, which we call a second year. They are also provided in that context. The question also raises absolutely the need for a quality standard, which we are developing. The question particularly relates to after-school care. Allied to that is a way of monitoring and ensuring that those quality standards can be implemented and that those who do not comply will have to answer as to why they should be in receipt of public money.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	186	By now we should all see the evidence that the more we invest in our population at an earlier point, the greater the return at the other end. It is really well worth our while as a State putting resources into very young children in order to reap the benefits at the other end. There will be fewer problems with addiction, anti-social behaviour and repeated jail terms. It relates to the ability to have well-rounded citizens who can stand on their own two feet and see through their education. There is a need to invest in children when they are very young.

In the context of my Department's spend, I am delighted that developing a more sustainable, affordable and quality child care system, particularly regarding prevention and early intervention, is second only to the expenditure for Tusla. For the past 15 years, in my professional life I have been a crusader and campaigner for prevention and early intervention, encouraging that kind of investment. With the likes of area-based childhood programmes etc., we have had to draw on philanthropic support and that may not be as much of a possibility in future. That should not represent a barrier to us finding adequate investment, especially for earlier years.

I have been concerned about this for a very long time. I am asking the Minister to make a statement and clarify the number of applications made for supervision orders, indicating how many supervision orders were granted consequent on those applications to the courts and are consequent on the courts refusing a care order and giving a supervision order.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	189	I am aware of the Deputy's concern in this regard in light of other exchanges we have had. Perhaps we can tease this out a little more. The latest figures available from the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, are for 2014. They indicate that there were 435 children under new supervision orders throughout 2014 and that there were 413 children subject to a supervision order on 31 December 2014. These figures relate to the number of children and not the number of applications that may have been made and granted. Consequently, there may be several orders in respect of the same child over a period. Figures reported by the Courts Service are not counted on a like-for-like basis and are not directly comparable. However, I understand from cases reported as part of the child care law reporting project, conducted by Dr. Carol Coulter, that about 70% of applications for supervision orders were granted and a further 16% were adjourned by the end of 2014. The number of supervision orders that were granted in place of a care order is not available. Each child welfare and protection referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team. All referrals are screened by a social worker to see if the child needs a social work service. If required, a social worker works with the parent or parents to support them in providing safe care for their child. In some instances, Tusla may apply to the District Court for a supervision order to underpin the ongoing social work role within the family. These orders can be particularly helpful when dealing with adolescents living at home who may be at risk due to their behaviour. Such an order allows the young person and their family to benefit from a structured engagement with social workers. In many cases, where a child is being discharged from care a supervision order may be granted as part of the child's care plan to facilitate reunification with the family.

I welcome the figures provided by the Minister, indicating there were 413 children subject to a supervision order as of 31 December 2014. That is the first time I have got a figure and I thank the Minister for that. However, to understand the figure it must be placed in context. How many care orders were in existence at that point? I have had the privilege of working both in law and psychology and I can only give my experience plus what people tell me. It seems that care orders are applied for much more regularly than supervision orders, as supervision orders have implications for resources. We know that in each area, city and county that there is a lack of social workers. The easier option - I use the phrase with the greatest respect - is to apply for a care order and take the child rather than putting in a supervision order with the necessary resources. That is particularly relevant in light of the recent high profile case when a seven year old child who spent half his life with his grandparents was taken. I am not going into the detail of the case but simply indicating the child was taken. It is the same experience with children taken into care when a supervision order might be much more appropriate. I am trying to establish the frequency of one compared with the other and if the lack of resources is leading to an abundance of care orders instead of supervision orders.

I recall her referring to the issue in earlier exchanges. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that social workers apply for care orders rather than supervision orders because care orders are less time consuming. I acknowledge that the Deputy has a suspicion or an intuition in that regard but there is currently no evidence to that end. The application to the courts for a care order is an intensive procedure involving the holding of a multidisciplinary case conference, the preparation of legal applications, the development of a care plan and finding a suitable placement, with arrangement and facilitation of family access. When in care, the child continues to have an allocated social worker with regular care planning reviews.

We cannot say there is no evidence as there is an obligation on Tusla to have the evidence. The figures should be before us today and if that is not possible, they should come before us at the earliest opportunity. That should be before a Minister would make a statement that there is no evidence. I can only speak from my experience and the representations made to me, which suggest clearly that care orders are applied for more frequently than supervision orders. The question is whether that arises because of a lack of resources. It seems to be the case. Every Deputy in the House knows there is a lack of social workers for regular work, not to mention putting in resources for a supervision order. Ultimately, the welfare of the child is paramount in all the legislation, including the Child Care Act as amended. There was a referendum to put a special provision in the Constitution to protect children but none of this evidence was available at the time; it is still not available in 2016. In working with the Minister, I hope we can get those figures and make proper evaluations rather than statements that the evidence is not available.

I have argued there is no evidence and the Deputy has indicated that perhaps Tusla has an obligation to collect that evidence. I trust the context from which the Deputy speaks and her concern. I will commit to continuing this conversation and seeing how we can progress the issue.On that basis, if I believe there is a strong reason to go to Tusla to request that this be brought forward, I will do that. That is what I suggest.

There is no greater task ahead of the Minister than resolving this issue, and I would like to hear how she proposes to do that.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	196	I agree that this is a great concern for all of us and it is a priority for me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, both in terms of the specific aspect the Deputy raises in respect of adult homeless accommodation and the wider issues I referred to in reply to an earlier question. Recent reports of a number of families having to avail of emergency accommodation in facilities that are intended for use by homeless adults only are very distressing. I have been informed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that the placement of families into adult emergency accommodation in Dublin is a last resort. It only occurs late at night when no other accommodation can be sourced in the city through family accommodation or commercial hotels. Such a response is clearly undesirable, but it is sometimes the only option available to ensure a family does not sleep rough. In these circumstances, families are accommodated in secure and defined areas that are separate from other adult service users. I understand that Dublin City Council has confirmed that fewer than ten incidences of such placements occurred recently. Each family was subsequently contacted the next morning by a member of the family homeless action team which worked with the housing authorities to provide more suitable alternative accommodation. Still, it should not have to occur, and I am very cognisant that we must work to reduce the occasions on which this happens. I cannot imagine what it might have been like if my three brothers, one sister and I had to do something like that. With regard to the actions I have taken on the welfare of homeless children, as the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides family support and works with relevant services to maximise the supports available to children and families who are homeless. Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive are shortly to sign off on a joint protocol which includes guidance on working with families where child protection concerns arise within emergency homeless accommodation.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I anticipate that the protocol will be in full operation this month. Tusla has also appointed a homelessness liaison officer to lead on its engagement with homeless services, particularly on child protection issues. Issues related to homelessness are a key priority for the Government. In conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues, I am seeking to define a set of measures to better support children with their families in emergency homeless accommodation.

It is an absolute scandal in an EU state. There are 2,121 homeless children, and the figures have doubled. I have seen in Dublin West, where we have a homelessness crisis, that there are serious knock-on impacts on children from being homeless and from the housing crisis in general. Children are falling behind in school, for example. There is no hotel or homeless accommodation in the area and we have people getting two buses across the city. Children are losing their friends. They are incurring stigma, shame and depression from the situation they are in, which is living in a hotel. One family I know are there for one year and two months. Obesity is also a serious problem. How are families meant to get decent, healthy food when they cannot cook for themselves? Children are becoming seriously obese and there are also knock-on impacts on their parents. Has the Department done any audit of this or is it commissioning an audit on the damage that is being done?

All the issues she identifies are very distressing for me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but also just as a human being and a citizen of this country. I referred to some of this in an earlier question, but I have already had a number of meetings and conversations with many of the non-governmental organisations in this area, especially in respect of children in emergency accommodation and hotels. I am aware that often the children in the hotels are away from their schools and that causes a problem. Families also do not have the facilities to cook. As we approach the summer months, one of our great concerns is that hotel accommodation may not even be available because of what is going on in terms of the tourism industry. As I said earlier, I have gathered a number of people already to discuss this. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I are beginning to work on a plan specifically to address children who are homeless. In the next couple of weeks I will gather the stakeholders again to identify short-term measures as well as beginning to plan for medium-term measures to ensure children are cared for in that context.

One of the contributions to the committee came from SONAS housing association which reported that women and children are choosing to stay in violent homes rather than go into homelessness. The health of children and women is being jeopardised because of this situation. The Minister took a very controversial decision to join the Government which has overseen a doubling of homelessness. I assume she factored all that in when she took that decision. How does she see this situation being ended without emergency measures being taken to build homes for those who need them and serious tackling of the wealth that exists in this society? We have seen the rich list. The people at the top have doubled their wealth, yet we have people living in these situations. In 2014, there were 465 adults with children and there were 726 children homeless in Ireland. Now there are 1,570. Why did the Minister take such a controversial decision to join the Government that allowed this situation to develop in the first place?

It was not a universally popular decision and I am aware of that. I discerned it carefully. The Deputy is absolutely right in that there is a major challenge here. I have been describing to her and to Deputy Rabbitte earlier how this issue in particular is a key concern of mine, and I have already done a number of things in terms of bringing together some of the stakeholders and making a commitment to working closely with my Cabinet colleague in this regard. I am also very aware of some of the issues in respect of SONAS housing association. I did a great deal of research and work with it earlier in my career, so I am aware and I am appalled, as the Deputy identified, to hear that in those circumstances the alternative for women and children is to stay where they are, which is not a good thing either. I am deeply concerned by that. We have only a certain amount of time. Judge us on what we manage to do. I am happy to be judged on that.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	203	As part of its budget submission for 2016, Tusla identified a need for extra staffing to meet critical service concerns, including children with no allocated social worker. Funding of €6.1 million was allocated to Tusla for this purpose. Tusla has set a target of a net increase of 168 social workers by the end of 2016. It will be important to recruit other grades as well to ensure an efficient service with the right mix of staffing, including family support staff and administrative support. Tusla has been proactive in its efforts to meet its recruitment targets in a competitive environment for professional staff. Progress is being made, and at the end of April 2016, an additional 110 social workers were employed directly by Tusla compared with the same period in 2015. Tusla has also established its own in-house recruitment team, Tusla Recruit, which has engaged directly with third level institutions to promote Tusla as an employer of choice. While it is still early days, this approach appears to be working, with more than 290 expressions of interest in response to a recent graduate campaign. Tusla will commence interviewing these graduates during the summer. I assure the Deputy that all urgent and emergency child protection cases are dealt with immediately. Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker. Unallocated cases are often cases where a child has just come into care and is awaiting allocation of a social worker, or where a child is in a very stable fostering placement, provided perhaps by a relative. Cases are subject to ongoing reviews and, where appropriate, the level and nature of support being provided will change depending on the needs of the child. Tusla has advised me that there was a significant reduction of 17% in the number of open cases awaiting allocation of a social worker at the end of March 2016 compared to December 2015.

However, from talking to some Tusla staff members in Dublin I am concerned that they have a problem with holding on to staff because the workload is so heavy. I would like to know what is Tusla's level of staff retention. I do not remember the exact figure, the Minister said some 100 were recruited in the year to date. Are these positions temporary or permanent and how many are senior personnel within the organisation? Reference was made to children who are high, medium and low risk. I hope the 1,300 children who are in the high-risk category are getting full attention. However, medium to low-risk children are potentially high risk for future because of the current position regarding recruitment by Tusla. Some 25% of referrals have yet to be allocated a social worker across many of the areas and approximately 50% in Dublin. This is a huge concern and I am sure the Minister understands the problem. I know she is meeting representatives from Tusla but perhaps the Minister could clarify if this could be expedited so a full workforce could be recruited to use up the €6 million?

I will certainly refer back to many of them. With regard to the efforts to recruit and retain staff, especially social workers, Tusla has an in-house recruitment function. It is reducing recruitment timelines and is identifying bottlenecks and working, where appropriate, with the national recruitment service of the HSE. Tusla is proactively engaging with third level institutions and overseas recruiters. It is also developing an employee assistance programme and managing caseloads, which is a very proactive measure. In addition, there is an internal staff transfer policy in place across Tusla to facilitate geographical mobility. The HSE does not have that facility. We are ensuring that staff have the appropriate ICT equipment and infrastructure to support their work.

Importantly, it is not based on SNAs but on a system of seven levels of progressive support. This model is tailored to the specific needs of children - moving from universal to targeted - to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE model. It was recommended by an expert interdepartmental group and I believe it represents the best way forward. Some of the main supports offered under this model include: a new higher education programme in inclusion will upskill early years practitioners in inclusive early years care and education - my Department will fund a small capitation increase where service providers employ a graduate from the programme; a dedicated website containing comprehensive information resources for parents and providers; advice and support from a team of 50 experts in early years education for children with disabilities; a scheme for the provision of specialised equipment, appliances and minor building alterations; therapeutic intervention where this is needed to allow a child enrol, and fully participate in, preschool; and additional capitation to enable the preschool leader to buy in additional support or reduce the staff-child ratio where this is critical to ensuring a child’s participation. The new model focuses on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability, their strengths and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to preschool. Service providers and parents will be able to submit applications for supports under the new model this month to allow them to plan for preschool enrolment in September 2016. It will take some time for the model to be fully implemented and working to full capacity. In the meantime, there is a commitment that all supports currently available through the HSE and various agencies will remain in place.

I recognise what the Minister has said with regard to diagnosis. She is quite right that it is very likely that many children will not have a diagnosis by the time they access these services. The model is welcome as it incorporates many new approaches to enable full inclusion and meaningful participation for children with disabilities. Aspects of the model are certainly measures that Sinn Féin would support. If implemented correctly, these could address many issues facing children in the ECCE programmes. However, I am not convinced that the model is without its faults. I know this policy was not of the current Minister's making and that she is keeping it under review. That is why the question was tabled. Let us consider the sector as a whole. Obviously, there are family resource centres and private providers which provide ECCE programmes so it is a rather mixed sector. Our concern is that now, and potentially into the future, SNAs would be provided on an ad hoc basis which would not be adequate and we would not consider that to be a satisfactory situation.

What I have outlined in my measure is a move and a transition to a new way. It is a transition to a new way that was developed on the basis of extensive consultation, research and work with experts who are now designing around what the research indicates may be a better way to ensure inclusion and access of our very beautiful young children who have some form of disability. I am going to trust that process with regard to that body of work and research. The Deputy is correct to identify the importance of being very careful about watching this unfold and the importance of monitoring and reviewing it. I appreciate the challenge it will be for the current system as well as for the people who are part of that system and who are working as SNAs.

I am glad that the concerns will be taken on board and will contribute to the transition in whatever way is appropriate. Will the Minister indicate when this transition to a new model might take place? In the interim, does she anticipate that the HSE will consider any additional manner by which SNAs can be allocated in an appropriate manner, and even directly if necessary?

The full capacity will not be rolled out but it is going to be an additional resource, plan and implementation of efforts to be inclusive regarding children who are disabled. If I understand the Deputy's question, I am not necessarily anticipating any moves to look for additional SNAs because what is going to be rolled out initially will complement what is already there. As the process moves forward, there will be the implementation of that as a full approach to inclusion.

The reduction of children's poverty is a key political priority for my work as Minister. I informed the Taoiseach of that a couple of weeks ago. I have devoted all of my professional life in Ireland to the development of community based approaches to tackle children's poverty and to the design and delivery of effective prevention and early intervention strategies to do the same. I am fully committed to working with my colleagues in government, particularly the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, with whom I have had several discussions on which I can speak later, to ensure a collaborative approach to tackling child poverty. We will both be addressing a forthcoming conference on child poverty being organised by the Children's Rights Alliance and I am looking forward to what he will say at it. The Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two thirds by 2020, and that year is getting closer. The figure currently represents 100,000 children. I have asked to and will chair the policy consortium that leads the work of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to drive key actions but particularly, and the reason I asked especially for it, to drive the actions on children's poverty. The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in co-ordinating Government strategies on child poverty. It also has the lead responsibility for the national action plan for social inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed. Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the plan for this cross-sectoral priority. In February 2016, my Department, in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection, held an EU peer review with ten EU countries to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention to improve outcomes for children, in particular those who experience poverty. That is a lot of the policy but we are working towards complementing that with the actions as well.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	215	The Minister tells me about a general policy, but what specific direct actions does the Government plan to take to deal with this issue? Certain groups are particularly at risk such as children from lone-parent families, children in jobless households, Traveller and Roma children, children living in direct provision, children with disabilities and obviously those who are homeless. The measures brought in by the last Government had a significant direct impact on one-parent families and their children. For example, at 22.1% one-parent family households have the highest consistent poverty rate of any household type in Ireland but the cuts introduced in July 2015, which lowered the age threshold for the youngest child of new recipients to seven years of age, mean that one-parent families now have to fight even harder to make ends meet and God knows they face several barriers aside from that. A direct action would be, for example, to change that measure and go back to where we were. It was a draconian measure and one which was always going to have a terrible effect on lone parents and child poverty.

In respect of the commitments that I effectively put in and am pursuing in the programme for Government, particularly in relation to lone parents, which Deputy Wallace referenced in his question, the programme for Government commits to the design of a working family payment, particularly for low-income or even jobless households. In that regard, I am engaging in serious conversations and meetings with the Department of Social Protection to ensure, as provided in the commitment, that within the context of that design is the opportunity to raise those income disregards, particularly for lone parents, so that it will effectively be a measure that will not only reduce disincentives to taking up employment for low-income households but will also be a measure that will directly impact on children's poverty.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	217	Employment alone will not necessarily lift one-parent families or their children out of poverty. According to NERA, in the past 15 years there has been a gradual increase in the proportion of workers classified as being low paid in Ireland. For many one-parent families, the only jobs available are low paid and precarious ones. Other measures are required. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we now have more than 2,000 children growing up in direct provision. It is akin to State-sanctioned poverty. They get €9.60 a week; their parents get €19.10. We have been giving out about this for a long time but, sadly, it seems that it is still as bad as it was. When will something different happen? No one in the place would try to defend the direct provision system. It reminds me a bit of Guantanamo, which Obama threatened to close seven years ago but which is still open.

I referred to just one of the big commitments in the programme for Government and I hope in the context of my involvement that there will be a specific focus on the reduction of children's poverty. As we know, lots of things impact on it, but what would impact on it most immediately is potentially increasing some form of children's income support, which is something we are looking at as a possibility, perhaps in a targeted way, alongside supporting families to take up jobs. On lone parents, another commitment I placed in the programme for Government is to review access to higher education and the barriers for lone parents and, on the basis of that review and the recommendations that come out of it, to act in that regard. In looking at this working family payment and the way it is designed, we need to be aware, as Deputy Wallace stated, that this is not just about jobs but quality jobs and jobs that can ensure the parents' children move beyond poverty.

A similar question was raised earlier but I will say again, as it is important to place it on the record, that I am pleased to confirm that all the supports currently available through the HSE and various agencies will remain in place until the new model is fully operational. As the Deputy may be aware, the access and inclusion model is a cross-Government initiative led by my Department and involves the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and others. It will deliver seven levels of progressive support moving from the universal to the targeted, which I outlined a little earlier when I was answering another question, to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE programme. Work is well advanced across all elements of the model with a view to introducing this initiative later this month. As I have already stated, it will be introduced in phases and current supports will not be withdrawn until that is fully implemented.

The confirmation in respect of the supports is welcome but the core of the question refers to the status of the implementation. I tabled this question on supports for children with additional needs entering the free preschool year because there has been a massive information vacuum for both providers of these services and parents. Mums and dads anxious about the situation have been coming to or ringing me about the place in September for their child in Meath and elsewhere and whether the centres have the trained staff to take the child in September. In light of her response, will the Minister highlight how the Department expects to have the staff, some 4,000 in total, in these private early years centres fully trained so that they can provide the required support for children with additional needs? Does her Department expect every centre to have the trained staff in place in September? If not, can providers still avail of the additional two-year per child capitation funding which has been allocated to the centres, pitiful as it is, to provide children with additional needs access to the free preschool year?

This is what we want to achieve with this model. It is a critical aspect of that initiative as it is unfolding.

I welcome the Minister's confirmation on current supports. In County Meath, 100 children and their parents will be seeking supports from preschool services come September. Even though the €3,000 per annum for providers of special needs assistant, SNA, support is inadequate, at least it is a defined budget in County Meath. In the neighbouring county of Louth, there is no defined budget for children with additional needs. Until now, the free preschool has not been free for all. Some parents of children with additional needs have had to assist providers to pay for SNA support, with parents in some counties required to pay the entire amount. I welcome the Minister's confirmation about the supports currently available, but given we are only three months away from implementation of this initiative and there is a huge vacuum in terms of information about it, I am concerned whether the necessary level of trained staff across the 4,000 providers will be in place in time.

By way of background, current expenditure by the Department on youth work services decreased by 31.7% between 2008 and 2015. There is an enormous strain on youth services at a time when the needs of young people are growing and in the context of the expected 13% increase in youth numbers by 2021.

Any additional amount available will depend on the budgetary process in 2017. I will be closely involved in the decisions to be taken by Government in this regard. My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector to young people. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to 380,000 young people. The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities. Budget 2016 provided an additional €1.1 million in current youth funding to my Department, bringing the total allocation for youth services in 2016 to €51 million. This additional funding was a 2.5% increase over 2015. It will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. Next week I expect to announce details of youth work projects that are to receive funding under the new €600,000 youth employment initiative. This initiative and other supports for vulnerable young people are priorities in my plans for the further development of youth work services in line with the programme for Government. It will target those young people aged 15 to 24 years who are most at risk of unemployment and who are not in education, employment or training. It will be provided to voluntary youth services to support the provision of innovative programmes for young people to enhance their employability skills and competencies. All my decisions on funding for youth services will be informed by the National Youth Strategy 2015-2020.

However, it is not enough. I look forward to the announcement next week on the provision of extra resources and supports for 15 to 25 year olds. I draw the Minister's attention to the Indecon report of 2012 which estimated that for every €1 invested in youth work, the economic benefit to the State is €2.02. This helps to promote active citizenship and supports participation by young people in education and training. This investment also reduces long-term costs to the State in respect of health, justice and welfare services for young people, which is vitally important. In County Kildare there are 77,832 people under 25 years of age, which is the highest youth population in the country. Kildare also has the highest birth rate in the country, yet it is the county in which investment in young people is the lowest. Does the Minister plan to increase funding for the various agencies and stakeholders that collaborate well together in terms of our vulnerable youth despite huge gaps in resources and funding?

I agree with the Deputy that early investment pays off in the long run. It is one of the best ways to try to bring about change in this area. I would welcome the Deputy's input, and that of her colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, who is the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on children and youth affairs, in building a case for the areas of youth services that would benefit most in terms of the choices that have to made up to 2017.

Deputy Rabbitte and I are happy to work closely with her on this issue. I referred earlier to the excellent collaborative work, in particular by Newbridge Resource Centre and Teach Dara. Kildare has only three resource centres while Kerry has 13. It is clear that the money does not necessarily follow the demographic profile of a county. Kildare urgently needs investment in youth workers to help support the 40,000 volunteers about whom the Minister spoke. For example, yesterday we heard in a presentation from MOJO that it urgently requires resources and funding for those between 18 and 25 years, especially young men. While I welcome the Minister's commitment to collaboration and look forward to her announcements next week, will she commit to increased supports for existing organisations that need it?

I would be delighted to go to Kildare.

This project has been very successful in helping to improve the lot of children in this area and is a best practice model that should be rolled out across the State. Ballymun has suffered and continues to suffer from disadvantage and child poverty, but it has made significant strides to deal with these issues, in particular since the inception of Young Ballymun in 2007.Since then almost €20 million has been invested in rolling out a strategy to address the causes and effects of child poverty. This was made possible by the generosity and foresight of Atlantic Philanthropies and their partnership with the Department of Health and the Office of the Minister for Children, now the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. In December 2009 the Young Ballymun plan moved into full operation, investing in primary care health services, early years providers, primary schools and family and community services in a shared vision to improve learning and well-being outcomes for children in Ballymun. Working with teachers, principals and parents, literacy outcomes in primary schools have significantly improved. An analysis of school literacy test data has shown that the number of children in need of learning support halved from 2007 to 2015, and the proportion of children with reading difficulty decreased by nearly a third. In spite of the adverse economic conditions, the banking crisis, the recession and major reductions in public investment and public services, the plan has been, and is being, successfully implemented and the outcomes are remarkable. Improved outcomes for children in Ballymun have been measured with high levels of literacy improvement across primary schools, improved child social and emotional development and, crucially, measurable improvements in parenting know-how and in the mental health of parents. These measures have laid the foundation stones for long-term social regeneration and breaking the cycle of poverty. To achieve real change for communities experiencing social disadvantage, the realisation that this a long-term project is essential. However, extra funding is needed to complete the programme.

Deputy Ellis and I are long-time representatives of the Ballymun area, but we also work very closely with public, national and local representatives from all parties who are absolutely committed to the Young Ballymun model. We have long experience of the success of that model and are very conscious of the scale, depth and complexity of disadvantage within an area like Ballymun, a town of 18,000 people. It is important to bear in mind that huge scale. We are very conscious that since 2007 Young Ballymun has made an enormous difference to the lives of many children and their parents within Ballymun. That is because it is not a single project but an area-based change programme that works very closely with everybody involved in children's lives: parents, public health nurses, preschool leaders, primary school teachers and everybody who interacts with children. That is the secret of its success. There are some 4,000 children, parents and service providers involved in the Young Ballymun project this year alone. It has been hugely successful and has made an enormous difference to the well-being of children and families in the area. That is why we are so disappointed that funding is running out for this project. All of us, at a political level, met with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. We made the case and were told that consideration would be given to extending the funding to allow Young Ballymun to continue for another year. We were very disappointed when the Department came up with €1.2 million and split it three ways, even though the Young Ballymun project is on an entirely different scale from the other two projects that received funding. This project is supported by many different people, from Danny McCoy to Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, Tony Fahey and Fr. Peter McVerry. This is a tried and tested programme. We want to retain it, and it needs to be expanded to other areas. That model is there and can be used. I ask the Minister, please, not to close it down.

I have read some of the opinions of the very esteemed people Deputy Shortall identified and, as she is well aware, I watched the origins as well as some of the earlier growth of Young Ballymun and its impact. I welcome the opportunity to explain the state of play from the Department's perspective. I indicated earlier to Deputy Shortall that I have spent some time reviewing these issues in the early days of my ministry. The area-based childhood programme, ABC, runs from 2013 to 2017 and is a prevention and early intervention initiative jointly funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Atlantic Philanthropies to the amount of €29.7 million. The aim of the ABC programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in 13 areas of disadvantage in Ireland. Young Ballymun is one of the 13 organisations participating in the ABC programme, and was allocated €5 million of the overall €29.7 million ABC budget - the highest recipient of programme funding. Prior to the ABC programme, Young Ballymun received €15 million under the prevention and early intervention programme, PEIP, which ran from 2007 to 2013. In respect of the need for additional funding which the Deputies raised, three organisations participated in the PEIP, moved into the ABC programme at an early stage and were due to conclude operations in mid-2016. Deputy Shortall indicated that the Department has committed additional funding of €400,000 to each of the three organisations: Young Ballymun, the childhood development initiative in TaIlaght and the Preparing for Life programme in Darndale. I acknowledge what she has said about how disappointing that amount of money is for Young Ballymun, but this base level funding-----

This base level funding will go towards aligning the completion of programme activities for all 13 ABC grant recipients to August 2017. In the meantime, the funders and the three local sites are exploring further funding arrangements to ensure continued service provision. It will also ensure that Young Ballymun can inform the national evaluation of the ABC programme, which is extremely critical, prioritise those aspects of its service delivery that demonstrate compelling evidence of significant positive impact, and progress the transition of these programmes and services into the mainstream locally. Young Ballymun has welcomed this additional funding and has indicated that it will submit a board-approved proposal outlining a prioritised programme provision in the coming weeks. A broad range of interventions have been tried out across all 13 ABC sites. Rather than rolling out a model for any one particular ABC site across the State, a strategic approach will be taken whereby interventions supported by the best evidence of impact will be identified and the lessons from these disseminated. Several evaluations are continuing which will inform this approach. First there is a national evaluation of all the sites participating in the ABC programme, conducted by the Centre for Effective Services. Second, alongside that national evaluation, many sites are conducting local evaluations of their work. Very promising evaluations are already available from other sites in the original PEIP. In the case of Young Ballymun, as part of the funding arrangement under the ABC programme, the funders requested that it develop further its evidence base supporting its range of interventions. In response, Young Ballymun commissioned a performance story report in 2015 to assemble an evidence base to support its work, produced a draft report and assembled a jury of international experts to review it. They concluded that there was evidence of change in a range of outcome areas in Ballymun and acknowledged the contributions of the programme and other initiatives to these changes. It also concluded that some areas of evidence required strengthening before firmer conclusions could be drawn. I want to ensure that the lessons from effective interventions under the ABC programme are harnessed and brought into the mainstream of existing services nationally. Officials in the Department are working to ensure coherent and strategic next steps for prevention and early intervention in Ireland, and this work will be given added impetus given the range of programme for Government commitments. I hope to have that well advanced in the coming months and to have a clearer view of the next steps. We are considering lots of different issues in that regard and will examine evaluation results and the recommendations of the group to help bring the lessons into the mainstream. In the meantime, the officials continue to liaise with Young Ballymun to ensure priority services can be secured until mid-2017.

My Adjournment matter relates to the event centre proposed and planned for Cork. It is a crucial project for Cork city. The lack of such a facility during the years has led to any number of events, incuding corporate events, party political Ard-Fheiseanna and concerts, being lost to Cork, with the potential economic benefits. It is welcome that the previous Government committed to funding the project. It was, by and large, an exception to the lack of investment in Cork in recent years. The M20 project was not delivered, which was a scandalous decision and the most notable example. It is believed the centre would be able to facilitate approximately 200 performances a year and mean about €50 million for the local economy and 500,000 visitors to Cork city per annum. It is an enormous project of significant value which is very important to commerce and the leisure industry in the city. Not only that, there would also be food and retail aspects, as well as apartments. It has the potential to revitalise substantial parts of Cork city, from Barrack Street to North Main Street and South Main Street, right into the marsh, to which parts of the city it would make a major difference. There would also be by-products such as employment creation. I am aware of the Government's commitment of €10 million, as well as the €6 million committed by Cork City Council, both of which added €2 million subsequently, which means that the level of public funding for the project stands at about €20 million. The project was given the green light in December 2014. It is now four months since the Taoiseach turned the sod and it is becoming increasingly clear that it was just a farce and a stunt in the context of an election. There has been absolutely no progress since. The people of Cork are beginning to wonder about the current status of the project and what will happen next. As yet, there has been no construction. We are all aware that it will be a lengthy project which will probably require 26 months to complete and the only sod that has been turned on the site is the one that was turned by the Taoiseach. There is some confusion in Cork about the project. I do not want to say there is significant concern because there is no intention to create panic. My understanding is the Government commitment still stands. I hope the Minister of State will affirm this in the strongest possible terms and that the Government will not only follow through on it with funding but will also be actively involved in the process of ensuring the project is delivered and progressed. Heineken BAM is one of the largest partners involved in the project, but we have received no update from it since March. I understand the design has not yet been completed, nor have the contracts, never mind the construction phase. There needs to be a clear commitment to drive the project which is both significant and expensive, involving a cost of some €53 million. Aside from the €20 million in public funding, €33 million is required from the various partners involved in it. A significant job of work needs to be done and it is vitally important that we have a better understanding of how the project is progressing, in terms of financing, design, planning, contracts and, most importantly, construction. Things have dragged on for far too long. As I said, in the four months since the Taoiseach turned the sod we have seen no progress. The people of Cork are becoming frustrated and concerned.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  In the context of the Government's infrastructure and capital investment plan for the period 2016 to 2021, Building on Recovery, the Minister has allocated a grant of €12 million to Cork City Council towards the development of a multifunctional event centre in Cork city, the Cork event centre. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately €50 million and the centre will be built on the former Beamish and Crawford brewery site in the city centre. The grantee, Cork City Council, not the Department, is responsible for the management and delivery of the project. A service level agreement has been signed between the Department and the council which sets out the terms and conditions of the grant. Cork City Council undertook a competitive dialogue tender process in 2014 and a preferred bidder was selected, namely, Heineken BAM Consortium, for the construction of the centre and Live Nation limited as operator. Competitive dialogue is a procedure designed to provide more flexibility in the tendering process for more complex contracts. A competitive dialogue procedure was adopted in order to open a dialogue with suitable candidates to identify and define the means best suited to satisfying the council's needs. I understand from Cork City Council that negotiations with the preferred bidder are at an advanced stage and that it expects construction to begin in 2016. It is estimated that up to 250 people will be employed in the construction and design stage. The objective of the grant is to facilitate the council in delivering the design, construction and operation of a new multi-functional event centre in Cork city centre, with a capacity of 6,000 persons. It is envisaged that the event centre will, inter alia, be capable of accommodating a range of events, including concerts, festivals, family entertainment, cultural, sports, exhibitions, conferences and trade shows. The project supports the high levels goals of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, namely, to promote and develop Ireland's world-class artistic and creative strengths at home and abroad, maximising their societal, economic and reputational value for the economy and to support cultural tourism as one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product, thus stimulating job creation and economic regeneration. The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and creative industries to our society and economy. As a nation, we have a distinctive tradition of storytelling, image-making and music which complements many fields of the arts. The arts are and always have been fundamental human enterprises. In understanding art we understand ourselves. The arts are central to cultural identity and our identity as a nation. Irish people have a deep affinity with the practice of the arts. Arts and culture are important in the strategy for marketing Ireland and economic growth. In some respects, our culture is our international calling card. The Cork event centre will play its part in attracting visitors and promoting cultural tourism on the island of Ireland. It will add significantly to the cultural infrastructure of Cork for the enjoyment of citizens and tourists alike. The importance of the arts cannot be overstated. They help to foster creativity and innovation. In Ireland we are conscious of the role of the arts and culture sector in providing vital opportunities for self-expression and participation. We are determined to do our best to provide the conditions in which creative expression can flourish and are committed to enhancing access to the arts for people of all ages and income levels. The grant provided for Cork City Council for the new Cork event centre is critical to the delivery of the new centre and will help to underpin and grow the already vibrant arts and culture sector in Cork and its surrounds.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	My first duty is to congratulate Deputy Seán Canney, an east Galway man, on his promotion to Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. There is no doubt that he will have one of the most difficult jobs in the coming year and he will share the portfolio with the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran who, no more than the Minister of State, knows quite a lot about the impact of the floods. Flooding is still a major issue throughout the western region, particularly in counties Roscommon and Galway. Many homes, businesses and individuals are still bearing the brunt of the devastating consequences of widespread flooding.The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, acknowledged on local radio recently that we have major difficulties. The floods have disappeared to some degree in certain areas, but many parts of County Roscommon in particular are still badly affected by flooding such as Castleplunkett in west Roscommon, Knockcroghery just outside Roscommon town and Dysart in south Roscommon. I have spoken to individuals in Roscommon County Council who informed me that the estimate to repair the damage caused by the floods of 2015 and 2016 is €11 million. That is the amount required to repair the damage caused to roads, buildings and land. The allocation received from the Department to date is €4.9 million. The council faces a shortfall of more than €6 million. Roscommon County Council could apply for funding through the non-coastal mitigation measures available from the Office of Public Works of which the Minister of State is aware. However, the funding is based on a cost-benefit system, which means areas with a greater population density are favoured as they can be proven to be better value for money. For example, an application to address flooding issues in an estate of 16 or 20 houses would be favoured above an individual house in a rural area. Given that Roscommon is a sparsely populated county with significant distances between houses, it would be difficult to get the Office of Public Works to favour what we need in Roscommon. That is our biggest problem. If the situation is not rectified, it will have a detrimental effect on the constituency as many areas are sparsely populated and many homes and businesses which were devastated by recent floods are still suffering the consequences and trying to get back on their feet. Now we have the added issue of not being able to get insurance cover, which is another matter that must be faced by the Government. A total of 133 different areas throughout County Roscommon were affected by the floods. Many home owners and business owners are becoming increasingly frustrated as they become the forgotten story in this land. There are stories behind the headlines whereby farmers face a bleak winter as they cannot cut silage or hay because some of their land is still flooded. The grass on the land would not be fit for use as fodder because, as the Minister of State is aware, all of the nutrients have been taken out of the ground by the flood water. For several months people have had to make long round trips to bring their children to school. Six months on, one house still requires to have water pumped out. The situation in another two or three houses has just been sorted out in recent weeks. I have invited the Minister of State to come to County Roscommon and I know he will do so. We will plan the visit and do it right. It is important that the Minister of State visits County Roscommon. The allocated funding does not address flooding in and around turloughs, which is a major issue in the constituency, in particular in areas such as Lough Funshinagh outside Knockcroghery where 250 acres of land is still covered by water. The Minister of State will see that when he visits the county. The water level has only dropped by 16 in. A 92 year old man told me he has never seen such a problem in his lifetime. He cannot understand what has gone wrong. As the Minister of State is aware, agriculture is the backbone of the county. The economy of the county is important to us. In the context of the 250 acre area that is flooded, a number of farmers are affected as the land is divided into smallholdings. I urge the Minister of State to do all in his power to introduce a scheme straight away that would give sufficient money to Roscommon County Council to carry out at the very least fire brigade action as the county is in a desperate state.

I look forward to working with him as Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on flood relief. I congratulate him on taking on that position. Like Deputy Murphy, my constituency has been well and truly doused with water since 2009 and again in 2012 and 2015, and I share his concerns. I am grateful to Deputy Murphy for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the response of the Office of Public Works, OPW, to the challenges posed by the risk and actuality of flooding. I am very aware of the impact on communities of the severe flooding events of last winter and the continuing risk that flooding will recur. During those flood events, a co-ordinated response was provided in line with the Government's national emergency framework. The broad-ranging response targeted the immediate needs of people and communities through the delivery of sandbags and pumps to prevent flood waters entering properties, the deployment of Defence Forces personnel to assist local authorities, the provision through the humanitarian assistance scheme of funding for food, clothes, accommodation, the replacement of household equipment and structural repairs for the households worst affected by flooding, and the provision of special supports to businesses and farmers to ameliorate the consequences of the floods. The OPW, as the lead State body for the co-ordination and implementation of Government policy on the management of flood risk, is committed to a planned and structured approach to the issue. The core strategy for addressing the significant flood risks nationally is the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme of the Office of Public Works, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with local authorities. A total of 300 locations nationwide are being assessed which have been designated as potentially being at significant flood risk. The CFRAM programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each of the 300 locations, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. The draft flood mapping is now being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation on 23 December 2015. Work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is under way. Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated flood risk management plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified. The draft plans are scheduled to be made available for public consultation in the coming weeks. Following the public consultation process, the finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective manner. The Government's Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021 includes a significant increase in the levels of investment in the area of flood relief, and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the flood risk management plans. A total of €430 million has been made available in the investment plan. Progress has continued this year on the existing capital works programme of the OPW through ongoing construction works on five major projects and the advancement of many others through design and procurement stages. Works have commenced on the Claregalway flood relief scheme in County Galway, and works will shortly be commenced on schemes in Skibbereen, where the contract was signed only last Tuesday, and in Bandon, County Cork, Foynes, County Limerick, and the Dunkellin river and Aggard stream in County Galway. In addition, several schemes have been advanced through design and will be progressed into the confirmation stage under the Arterial Drainage Acts or planning under the planning regulations later this year. These include Blackpool, Clonakilty, Glashaboy and Douglas in County Cork and Templemore, County Tipperary. The OPW and Cork City Council have also agreed in principle to advance flood relief works in Cork city as part of a public realm project being undertaken by the city council on Morrison's Island. Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each local authority to investigate and address, and local authorities may carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources. The OPW also funds local authorities for small-scale flood relief studies and works up to a cost limit of €500,000 under the minor flood mitigation works scheme. Already in 2016, the OPW has approved 25 projects in various parts of the country.

The Trinity Adult Resource Group for Education and Training, TARGET, is based at St. Kevin's national school in Donaghmede and has been at this location since 1993, that is, for 23 years. It provides vital services to the community of Donaghmede and surrounding areas. These services include adult literacy for early school leavers and other adult learners experiencing difficulties in this area, a counselling service, counsellor training, community child care, English classes for non-nationals, community education and computer classes for the elderly. A community employment scheme with 30 participants also is based at TARGET. Some of these community employment scheme participants are outsourced to other community groups in the parish and play a vital role in community development. It appears that the host school, St. Kevin's, is under pressure for space. There was a previous agreement whereby TARGET would cede two classrooms back to the school for September 2016. However, TARGET received a letter from the school at the beginning of this month requesting that all the space be returned to the school by 30 June this year. In short, TARGET has been asked to vacate the building at very short notice. This has come as a severe blow and could lead to the loss of vital services in this area. Funding streams will be put at risk and employment could be lost. I thank the Minister for Education and Skills for his attendance this evening. He obviously is a local Deputy like me and I ask him to use his good offices to try to reach a negotiated agreement with the various parties with a view to solving this problem. At the very least, TARGET needs more time to try to deal with this difficult situation. It is clear that St. Kevin's national school requires more space. Perhaps a different solution can be found to ensure the school has the necessary capacity and I believe this must be explored further. It may also be that alternative facilities can be found for TARGET. I understand that a formal letter will be sent by TARGET in the near future to St. Kevin's school asking it to reconsider the matter. In a previous life, I was Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills with special responsibility for adult and further education and training and I am, therefore, very much aware of the importance of adult literacy and community education. This plays a crucial role in disadvantaged areas in particular as regards personal development and has positive benefits for society as a whole. The loss of these services in Donaghmede would be devastating. Consequently, I ask the Minister to use his good offices to try to sort out this matter as the situation is urgent. He also, for example, could consider asking the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, to intervene with a view to solving these difficulties. This requires a diplomatic solution and while I do not wish to tread on any toes in this regard, the services are well worth saving. With a little goodwill on all sides, a practical solution can be found. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to this urgent matter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23097	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-09 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	245	I thank Deputy Haughey for raising this important issue. I note neither the education and training board nor the Department had any advance notice that this issue was likely to occur. The City of Dublin Education and Training Board has been working with TARGET for a long time and, as the Deputy noted, it has been providing further education and training in Donaghmede for more than 20 years. It was located in St. Kevin's school, Newbrook Road, Donaghmede, and it provides a wide range of courses which the Deputy has outlined and I do not believe I need to repeat them. As he indicated, they include services that go well beyond the remit of the Department of Education and Skills into counselling, child care and many community services but it is supported specifically in respect of adult education provision by the CDETB. I am aware of the pressure of school enrolments on St. Kevin's junior school because it has experienced a 57% increase in the period between 2011 and 2015 and that trend is continuing. In that context, the school submitted an application in June 2015 to provide for the refurbishment of existing spaces to create two classroom-sized spaces to create a mainstream classroom and a resource room for special education. My Department examined and approved that application and the funding was provided. This latest decision by St. Kevin's, which has written to TARGET informing it that the school is not in position to renew the lease into the future, has come as news and obviously creates difficulties for TARGET in continuing its work. I have been in touch with the CDETB and it will make contact with representatives of TARGET to discuss the possible options, bearing in mind the pressures that exist. As the Deputy requested, I will explore what solutions can be found to ascertain whether the service can be continued, as it has been delivering a valuable service for a considerable time and the notice received has been extremely abrupt. I undertake to pursue this matter, as the Deputy suggests, to establish whether a solution can be found that would allow this to continue. While I do not have a specific course of action I can recommend to the Deputy at this stage, I thank him for raising the matter and I assure him I will give it attention.
