A scheme like this is needed to help these people and maybe save their lives.  These people are going into schools asking for help, but no provisions are in place to teach them or get anybody to answer or understand questions they ask.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to 1,000 jobs at the Xerox facility in Ballycoolin, Blanchardstown, Dublin; and the worry for the workers and their families.  In view of the importance of this issue, I hope the Chair will agree to this request.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach.  I understand that 14 matters will come before the House without debate next week.  A total of eight of these are motions back from committees without debate, while the remainder are before the House but are not to be discussed.  This is not acceptable and the Taoiseach might like to deal with it.It is perfectly obvious from the recent study that the prison system is not working and is breeding new crime and misery for the society it purports to serve.  This party produced a fines Bill on a number of occasions which was voted down by the Government as far back as 1998.  The study shows that 85% of those who have already done time for not paying fines will reoffend in some way.  We have a situation where criminals are running loose from prison.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Yes.  Will the Government introduce a fines Bill which will deal in part with this issue?  If the Taoiseach finds that the pressure of work on the Parliamentary Counsel is such that he cannot do that, I would be happy to reintroduce the fines Bill drafted by Fine Gael, to be amended by Government if that is appropriate.Under the legislation governing the Taoiseach's appointment of Ministers of State, will the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is not here, go today to the parents of Jordan Kelly and deal with the situation?

The fact is that for four years, those parents have been given tablets, a sheet of paper and told to raise their child.

Deputy Kenny has made his point.  I call the Taoiseach to reply to the first two questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	17	If there is any compassion or sense of competency, I ask the Taoiseach to advise the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to go down in his State-sponsored car to those parents and speak to them today.

However, in November of last year, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated the heads of a comprehensive new coroners Bill would be published to facilitate discussion.  When will it be before the House?Does the Taoiseach intend to make any appointments to the positions of Minister of State before the end of the session?  If so, when is he likely to make them?

Will it be part of the health Bill?  Will the Taoiseach, in light of the limited impact of the measures exposed by the information he provided last night, bring forward the Bill as a result?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	112	This budget is designed to sustain the strength of the economy over the next few years, as well as making a further substantial contribution to a fairer and more socially friendly Ireland.We are living in the midst of an astonishing period of national development.  We are at last bringing about the realisation of the immense potential in the land and people of Ireland that generations of patriots hoped for and dreamed of, but which sadly they never lived to see.This is a budget of commitments, meeting them and making them.  It is a budget for workers, enterprise, pensioners and family.  In the past 20 years, employment has virtually doubled to well over 2 million people.  Involuntary emigration is a thing of the past.  Instead fellow-EU citizens and some people of other nationalities have come to make their indispensable contribution to our economic life.  We continue to have consistently the highest growth rate in the eurozone.  Inflation has been held at low single figures, in line with the rest of Europe, despite much higher growth rates, and it is well controlled with the help of the social partners.  From being one of the least healthy countries financially, our national debt relative to national income, after taking account of the national pension fund reserve, will be brought down to under 15% of GDP next year.The budget is an entirely responsible one, designed not to overheat the economy and to give us a substantial safety margin if the existing environment should disimprove.  External conditions permitting, uninterrupted momentum can be maintained through next year and beyond, provided our broad strategy is adhered to.Yesterday's budget from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, marks not just another milestone towards substantial reform and development, it is, in key respects, the culmination of the coherent strategy of a series of budgets in recent years.  Inevitably, public attention has concentrated on some of the specific measures announced in the budget.  While these are important and worthy of comment, I want to focus this morning on the bigger picture, the results which our overall budgetary strategy is producing and the foundation which has been laid for further sustained progress in the years ahead.I emphasise the extent to which I have always seen my Government's strategy as being at the service of our people, those who are working hard to raise their families and create the best possible future for their children, our entrepreneurs, who are building world-class businesses in the face of stiff world competition, our older people, who have seen far too many days of long struggle and hardship in the past and who now deserve comfort in their retirement, and our vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens, who badly need our support if they are to live with dignity.There is no Government presumption in this.  We know that the consistently good revenue performance of recent years is due to the new investment made in world-class projects, small and developing businesses, professional and business services, tourism ventures and farm and agribusiness across the country.  It is due also to the hard work, flexibility and skill of the more than 2 million people at work in this State.  We know that their efforts and those investment decisions need the right policy framework.  The responsibility lies with Government to create that environment, through our economic policies, budgetary arrangements, our approach to flexible and smart regulation and our willingness to listen and respond.  It is for Government to provide confidence in the future and in our capacity as a country to manage the relentless change sweeping the global economy.Far from believing that it knows everything, the Government has been at pains to listen and to take on board what it hears.  We listen to those struggling to compete in world markets, international investors who have options to locate major projects almost anywhere in the world and our universities and international research experts about how to create a new platform for knowledge-based activity.  We listen to technical experts and project managers about how to get better value in our massive commitment to infrastructural improvement.We listen in particular to the social partners.  Earlier this year, we concluded a ground-breaking ten-year framework agreement with the social partners.  We have continued and deepened the partnership process as the most effective way of marshalling all of our resources for the benefit of all our people.  The Government knows what is required to sustain and develop this approach, which is the envy of governments and societies around the world, large and small, because they understand the critical part it has played in the Irish success story.If there is arrogance in the Irish political system, it rests with those who think that democratic government has to be some sort of merry-go-round, where parties have an automatic entitlement to take their turn at the levers of government at regular intervals. Democracy does not involve any such entitlement that is not earned.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I believe that the people deserve the best in terms of reliable and experienced leadership, capacity and hard work.  In this budget, the Government has shown again why it merits the people's continuing confidence in its commitment and capacity to serve them.In framing his budget, the Minister has been aiming for an outturn which would sustain the strong performance of the economy, continue on the path of fiscal sustainability and increase the impact of positive redistribution on those in need.  The remarkably strong revenue performance in the current year has led some Members opposite to make extraordinary claims.  On the one hand, they argued that our strong performance showed that taxes should be lower, that the Government did not need the money because public spending was high enough and could be funded through lower taxes, and on the other hand, they argue that there should be higher public spending because the resources are now available for an unlimited spending spree, except, of course, that it would be irresponsible of the Minister to embark on such a pre-election splurge.  These contradictory statements are sometimes expressed back-to-back by the same Opposition politicians.Some, who definitely know better, choose to ignore altogether the economic effects of fiscal policy on inflation and competitiveness as if the only issue that mattered was balancing the books by spending up to the limit.  Happily, we have a Minister for Finance and a Government that have a fine record of delivering what the economy requires in the present and for the future.A targeted general Government surplus of 1.2%, a forecast debt ratio of 23%, an increase in gross current spending of 11.5% and an increase of 13% in gross capital spending are budgetary parameters which are the envy of Europe and indeed further afield.  They represent a fiscal path that will underpin the future strong performance of the economy and sustain progressive real improvements in incomes and living standards, which the Government is committed to achieve in its agreement with the social partners, Towards 2016.The budget continues the strategy of investing approximately 5% of our GNP in developing and modernising our infrastructure.  Since 1997, and by the end of this year, 400 kilometres of motorway and dual carriageway will have been completed and opened.  Our public transport system is being transformed through investment in buses, rail and Luas.  We are doing in half a generation what other societies implemented over decades.  The national development plan, which the Government will publish in January, will chart the way to fulfil our ambition to have a world-class infrastructure appropriate to our needs, developed in a timely and cost-effective way.This budget is not just concerned with building for the future through responsible fiscal policies and ambitious investment programmes, important as they are.  On the contrary, it is equally concerned with our current needs.  I want to stress four key features of the budget in that regard: it completes a transition to a more equitable tax and welfare system; it maintains and deepens our strategy to reward work and enterprise; it provides real support for families with particular needs at critical stages of the life-cycle; and it provides incentives to deepen our competitiveness on a sustainable basis.I take particular satisfaction in knowing that the Government, in this budget, is achieving, and indeed exceeding in many cases, the targets which we set to attain, a better standard of adequacy in the social welfare payments for the most vulnerable people in our society.  The full year cost of the measures announced yesterday is a record €1.4 billion, and is a demonstration of our commitment to the less well-off in our society.  The Government had committed to increase the old age pension to at least €200 per week and, in this budget, it has more than delivered on that commitment.  By increasing the non-contributory pension by €18 per week, we are doing this, not just for recipients of contributory old age pensions, who will now receive €209 per week, but also for non-contributory pensioners.We also committed to increasing significantly the lower rates of social welfare and agreed with the social partners a target to be achieved by 2007.  In this budget, we are completing the transition to this substantially better income support for the most vulnerable in our society by increasing these rates by an unprecedented €20 per week.  This means that these lowest rates have increased by over €50 a week in the last three budgets.A particularly important measure in promoting social and gender equity is the decision announced yesterday to achieve, over three budgets, the transformation of the current qualified adult allowance for the dependants of non-contributory old age pensioners into a full pension of equal value and paid in their own right.  This new entitlement recognises in particular the role of those women who, because of social conditions in the past, did not have the opportunity to qualify for a social welfare pension in their own right, but who made a major contribution to their families and communities.  This is proper recognition of the role and entitlements of a most deserving group in society.The balanced nature of this budget package is also reflected in the tax provisions.  Through the increases in personal tax credits of €130 for single people and twice that for married couples, and the increase of €270 in the employee tax credit, we are continuing to ensure that those earning at the increased minimum wage level remain completely outside the tax net.  That means nearly 40% of earners are protected from having to pay tax, compared to 25% of earners in 1997.This significant achievement, despite the further increases in the rate of the national minimum wage which was introduced by this Government, will cost €657 million in a full year.  In addition, the entry point for payment of employee's PRSI is being increased, as is the threshold for payment of the health levy.  These changes are evidence of our commitment to maintaining a very low tax environment for those on low earnings.  It has long been acknowledged by the European Commission that we have the most favourable tax conditions for the low paid, which are incentives to take up work.By increasing the standard rate income tax band by €2,000 per year for single workers and pro rata for married earners, the Government is ensuring that those earning the average industrial wage in 2007, estimated at just over €33,000, will not be liable to pay tax at the higher rate.  Accordingly, 80% of income earners will continue to pay an effective tax rate of not more than 20%, in line with our commitments to social partnership and our programme for Government.In reducing the higher rate of tax by 1%, but increasing the health levy by half of 1% for those earning in excess of €100,000 per annum, the Government is honouring its commitments in the context of strong economic performance and recognising the importance of those who can do so making an appropriate contribution to the cost of caring for our older citizens and others in need of our support.  It contributes to the balanced and well judged character of the budget in achieving equitable and sustainable outcomes.Turning to our strategy to reward work and enterprise, I again highlight the critical importance of maintaining tax and welfare systems which reward effort and enterprise.  This is particularly important when we have made such progress in achieving our goals of improved adequacy of income support for those not currently in employment.  Such incentives must be substantially overhauled if higher income supports are not to turn into a poverty trap.The substantial resources applied to exempting those on the minimum wage from the tax net and ensuring that those on average earnings do not face the higher rate of tax are very effective in achieving precisely this result.  The strong employment performance reflected in last week's household survey figures, showing employment growing here at twice the rate in the rest of Europe and especially strongly for women, provides clear evidence of the continuing success of the Government's strategy in that regard.I particularly wish to refer to one aspect of the social welfare package, namely, the decision to abolish the waiting time for the back to education allowance in the case of workers made redundant who qualify for statutory redundancy and social welfare payments.  This may not impact on many individuals, but for those who face the very difficult experience of being made redundant, in this measure we are providing a direct support for the acquisition of new skills and knowledge.  It is right that we should support individuals who make the effort to improve their own employability in the face of difficult employment experiences.By increasing the incentives for investment in seed capital and venture capital targeted at small business, the Government is also increasing the availability of finance to those who take the initiative to establish their own business.  The dynamism of the small business sector and especially the willingness of people to establish new ventures is a critical test of the strength of any economy.  We are fortunate in having many who are willing to invest their time, talent and energy and, above all, to take risks in putting their ideas into practice in the market.The budget shows real flair and commitment in regard to support for families at critical stages of the life cycle.  This budget is good for all families.  For those with child-rearing responsibilities, the further increase in child benefit of €10 per month, the significant increase in child dependant allowance for families in receipt of social welfare payments and the doubling of the back to school allowance represent important practical support for the costs of child rearing.  The increase in the rate of maternity benefit in the reckonable earnings threshold for payment of that benefit and the increase in the duration of paid and unpaid maternity leave by four weeks each represent significant improvements for women at a particularly challenging time in the balancing of work and family commitments and important social progress for society as a whole.I am particularly proud of the improvements which are being made in the supports available to those with caring responsibilities within families.  In addition to increases in the level of payment of the carer's allowance and the increase in the respite care grant, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is introducing an entitlement for recipients of other social welfare payments to be paid a half rate carer's allowance in appropriate caring circumstances.  This is a major innovation which will redress what many had come to see as a serious anomaly.  It will recognise and support the invaluable work done by many people around the country who have assumed great burdens in enabling older people and people with severe disabilities to remain in their own home and community, and it will be rightly welcomed for that reason.Another critically important issue facing many families is the need to care for those with disabilities.  Last month, the Minister for Finance provided an increase of 10% in planned spending on disability-related services in 2007.  This has been increased in the budget by a further €100 million in support of residential, respite and day places, as well as the centrepiece of our new national disability strategy, the independent assessment of need and the provision of service statements, commencing with children under five from 1 June next.  It also enables substantial progress to be made in implementing our commitment to improved mental health services, set out in A Vision for Change.For those families with caring responsibilities in respect of older persons, there is the important provision of €255 million in full year terms to enable a total of over 5,000 comprehensive home care packages to be offered to older people and their carers to enable them to stay in their own homes.  There will be increased provision of residential care places and improvements in the nursing home subvention scheme, which the Minister for Health and Children will announce next week.  We will provide assurance to older people and their families about the availability of care, the standard of care and the cost of care.  With a further €40 million provided in the budget for improved health and personal social services, total spending on health will reach almost €15 billion next year and provide real supports for families and individuals across the whole spectrum of need for health and social care.  In that context, the increase in charges for private beds in public teaching hospitals and the small increase in excise duty on cigarettes are entirely reasonable provisions.On the needs of families at different stages of the life cycle, I wish to refer to the very important support now being given to first-time buyers.  The doubling of mortgage interest relief provides real and valuable support for those who are facing the financial pressure of mortgages taken out on first homes over the past seven years, as well as those who are about to take on that responsibility.  The Government is entirely right to provide support for all those who are facing this financial pressure and not just those signing a contract after the date of the budget.  Furthermore, by providing support in this way, the Minister is seeking to ensure that it benefits the purchaser and is not taken by the seller in the form of higher house prices.  Taken together with the substantial provision in the Book of Estimates for social housing and the continuing strategy to increase the volume and accessibility of affordable housing, the Government is showing its determination to continue the extraordinary record of achievement in housing output and increasing the capacity of young people to buy their own homes.Our capacity to continue to improve the quality and range of our public services depends on the strength and performance of the economy.  The budget recognises that a supportive environment is critical if we are to meet that challenge.  Through the significantly improved regime to support investment in research and development through the tax system, through support for investment in energy efficiency on the part of business and through the very significant improvements in administrative arrangements and in increased VAT thresholds for small business, in particular, the Minister has acted to address issues which are of concern to Irish firms of all sizes in all sectors, such as the reduction in the regulatory burden.  The improved conditions applying to the BES will be particularly welcome.In addition, through the budget's support on a joined-up basis for the development of renewable energy systems, it is providing support not only for more secure and cost effective energy supplies, but for greater environmental sustainability at this time of heightened awareness of the importance of addressing the problems of climate change.  Keeping Ireland green is an ambition common to all of us, but it needs to be done in a way that enhances living standards and quality of life.In addition to these improvements in the tax environment for all businesses, I wish to mention briefly a couple of specific initiatives, which, I know, will be widely welcome in the sectors concerned.  First, the decision to allow deductibility of accommodation services for conferences is a major boost for this important and growing segment of the tourism market.  This will give a major boost to a segment of activity with great potential to support employment and income in the tourism sector.  The dynamism of the tourism sector, which has seen visitor numbers comfortably exceed the 7 million target this year, gives the lie to the prophets of doom.  We are not losing competitiveness and market share and the economy is firing on all cylinders, not just the construction industry.  Government has got definite value for money from its expenditure on market promotion in the tourism sector.The package of measures to support developments in farming will be rightly seen as important for those facing the challenge of adaptation to the new agricultural environment.  The continuation of stock relief, improvements in the conditions applying to long-term leases of farm land and new arrangements for the purchase of formerly leased land will facilitate the necessary restructuring in farming.  The increase in the farmer's flat rate refund of VAT to 5.2% will benefit all farmers.  These measures complement the very substantial provisions agreed with the farm bodies in the context of Towards 2016, which provide a firm basis for rural and farming development in the period ahead.  Additional support for the establishment of bio-fuel crops is a welcome boost to necessary diversification at farm level.  Today, the spending that supports farm income comes as much from Government as the European Union.The various measures which I have briefly summarised represent the transition to a more equitable and sustainable tax and welfare regime.  Having achieved our targets, we approach the future from a position of strength and can judge the appropriate allocation of future resources to an appropriate mix of reductions in tax burdens, where surplus to requirements, and sustainable improvements in public services.  Our choices will continue to be informed by responsible fiscal policy underpinned by the competitive success which generates the resources for allocation in future budgets.  The measures announced yesterday provided clear assurance that competitive success can continue as investors at home and abroad respond to the supportive conditions created by the policies of the Government.I am proud that the Government has committed well over €5 billion to increased social welfare expenditure since 2002.  In the period, real social welfare rates to those on the lowest levels of benefit have increased by approximately 25%.  Payments to those in receipt of contributory old age pensions have increased by €62 and by €66 in the case of non-contributory pensions, bringing them to €103 and €110 respectively in the case of pensioner couples.  Having met our benchmarks, we can commit to maintain at least these real improvements in the years ahead and have the resources to address other priorities in the social welfare area at the same time.We will commit resources year by year to the improved infrastructure and support services which our economy and society require in line with the priorities of the national development plan to be published in January.  We are focused clearly and effectively on the goals for the long-term future of society which we set out with the social partners in Towards 2016.  I am confident the continued pursuit of the strategy set out in this year's budget and the qualities of leadership and effective management which the Government has displayed will ensure that together we build a society, every aspect of which we can be proud.  It will be a fairer, stronger Ireland.  It is possible that by the time we reach the historically resonant date of 2016, the vision and aspirations of the founders of the State will be capable of realisation.  I commend the budget to the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Yesterday's Budget Statement was the defining moment of the Government's attempts to win the next general election.  No Minister for Finance in the history of the State has addressed the Dáil with as much financial giftware as Deputy Cowen.  No previous Government has had such an opportunity to prepare our people for the future challenges which lie ahead but unlike this one no previous Government has wasted the opportunities it had.The budget provides an opportunity each year for the Government to signal the policy directions required to address the challenges our economy and society face.  Those challenges should have been the priority yesterday.  It is fundamentally the job of Government to protect the structures and observe the imperatives which drive economic growth and sustainability to ensure the society we want is funded properly.  What is required is the protection of the taxation and Revenue regime built up since the 1990s to allow us to sustain and develop it to ensure Ireland remains competitive and among the world's most successful economies.  We need a regime in which enterprise and commercial creativity are encouraged and rewarded and an Ireland in which jobs and opportunities reflect our community and future shape of society.It is also the Government's job to create the environment in which a successful society can prosper.  We must build a new Ireland from the bottom up in which family and respect for values are fundamental and in which care for each citizen is central in the context of the correct balance of rights and responsibilities.  Such a society is one in which the innocent are protected and anti-social trends and criminality are punished and dealt with.  Such a society is one in which the sick, elderly, mentally ill and young are served by a well-managed, planned and effective care structure.  Such a society is one in which local services and administration are reorganised to support the creation and development of real communities with amenities, access to essential services and meaningful transport systems and in which effort is directed as much to the creation of decent, stress-free lifestyles as profit.The Government's job is also to future-proof the country by organising its planning and investment to underpin long-term sustainability.  We require proper planning and identification of future needs in the medium and long terms across all sectors and social, education and economic infrastructures.  Education must be placed at the very core of our sustainability planning to equip the leaders of tomorrow with the skills and capacity to succeed and the standards and ethics to make wise judgments.  We require a safe, sustainable environment for all and the putting in place of structural mechanisms and processes to protect and build that environment into our economic, financial, physical and social infrastructure.  The function of accountable Government is to provide an equal and sustainable Ireland for all and it is against these criteria that yesterday's budget must be measured.I welcome two budgetary measures especially.  These are the increase in the old age pension and the package for small businesses, both of which are long overdue.  I wish like other Members to pay warm tribute to our pensioners who were for so long the backbone of the economy.  They built the country when times were tough and jobs and money were scarce.  It was a time, ironically, when keeping a family together meant fathers and mothers taking the boat to England from where they could send money home.  It was a generational reality which is unimaginable for families today.  Their pension increase is, therefore, welcome and deserved.  Overall, however, the budget is about dealing with the incompetence of the past rather than the needs of the future.The budget takes little account of how families are struggling and people on good incomes are finding it harder to make ends meet than before.  Its context is ten years of budgets, in which time, opportunities and billions of euro were wasted, and the achievement of two Irelands, one private and one public.  One of those Irelands is very successful while the other is chaotic.  Private wealth is met with public waste.  Ten years, ten budgets and tens of billions of euro later, people who try to access vital services find themselves tangling with a system which is hopelessly out of step with the lives they lead, the standards they expect and the taxes they pay.  We have seen €1 billion after €1 billion come and go.  Never has a Government had so much money or achieved so little in its spending.  Maximum spend has, in many cases, brought minuscule return.  In private life the world is always on while in public life it is too frequently off thanks to Government incompetence.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, said the budget was about reform and placing the citizen at the centre of our concerns, but the Government cannot deliver the necessary reform because it lacks the courage to make tough decisions.  The mindset and practice that created the problems in our public services is not the mindset that can fix them.  In the ten years and ten budgets the parties opposite have not been able to figure out or understand that when a Government spends money without exercising accountability and responsibility, without expecting and demanding reform, it ends up subsidising problems and not solving them.Real reform will require a change of Government, a better Government and above all a Government for public services, working in the public's interests.  Delivering those public services entails three fundamental requirements — competence, accountability and responsibility.  We need to set a new gold standard in each.  Every Minister should stand up and be accountable.  We can have no more disasters of accountability like e-voting and PPARS.  Every Minister should know that the hard work starts when the press conference ends and not vice versa.  Every Minister should be able to take the credit and blame in equal measure.  Any Minister reckless with the public’s money or clearly incompetent should be dismissed.  If people want to see the difference between me and the Taoiseach, that is one.  He did not act, I would have done.What have the people got for their billions?  They have got the reality of public life in Ireland in 2006, namely, waiting.  They are waiting in their cars for hours on the way to and from work as happened this morning — two and a half hours from Lucan.  They are waiting for hospital beds on lists that were promised to have been eliminated two years ago.  They are waiting four and a half years for an assessment for a child with mental illness.  They are waiting for neurosurgery, and cancer and brain surgery.  They are waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency units.  They are waiting for criminals who are running loose to be caught.  They are waiting for gardaí to show up on the beat and deal with escalating crime.  They are waiting for programmes to tackle the persistent literacy and numeracy problems in our schools.This was a budget of missed opportunities.  The budget continues the reckless expansion of Government taxation and spending without the necessary public sector reforms to ensure value for money.  In the period 2000 to 2007 the percentage of national income devoted to Government current spending has increased by almost 7 percentage points from less than 25% to almost 32%, hardly the record of a low-tax, low-spend Government.  The total tax burden is now approaching 38% of GNP, reversing a pattern of steady decline that characterised both the former rainbow Government and the early years of the present coalition.  This places Ireland in the upper third of OECD economies in terms of the size of Government, debunking the myth that the Government has offered a low-tax low-spend economic strategy.  As pointed out by Deputy Bruton, of the past four Government combinations, Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats from 1989 to 1992, Fianna Fáil and Labour from 1992 to 1994, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left from 1994 to 1997, and Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats from 1997 to 2006, the only Government in that period to reduce the overall tax take was the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government from 1994 to 1997.This money is being poured into an unreformed public sector.  The public will not see any significant impact.  A recent study by the European Central Bank found that Ireland ranks poorly in public sector efficiency.  The Government's national competitiveness council has also reported that "the rapid rise in current and capital public spending in recent years...has sometimes reflected not an increase in the quality or quantity of public services, but instead inflation of pay and non-pay costs".The Government has not honoured its income tax commitments to ordinary families.  In delivering its final budget, the Government will be acutely aware of its failure to deliver on its most specific tax promise in the programme for government, which was to ensure that no more than 20% of income-earners pay tax at the higher rate.  The Minister has changed the basis of his calculations to disguise the fact that 31% of taxpayers will pay at the higher, 41%, tax rate next year.  This means that 235,000 people have been let down by a Government that has failed to honour a clear commitment.  It is indicative of the Government's priorities in this area that its other specific tax promise to complete the extension of the single low 12.5% rate of corporate tax for exporters to all companies was delivered on time.  The Government has kept its promise to give more profits back to banks and property developers but not its promise to ordinary families on average incomes.  This means that 1.4 million income-earners, approximately 65% of the total, who are not paying tax at the higher rate, will see little if any benefit from the budget as the impact of the small increases in the credits and bands will be offset by the rising cost of living.It was also a budget in which the Government could have taken action in a targeted way on stamp duty.  It was an occasion to relieve first-time buyers in particular without any adverse interference in the housing market.  This is not a budget for hardworking families.  An increase of €10 euro per month or €2.50 per week in child benefit will not put any dent in the €1,000 per month child care costs — the baby mortgage.  Nor will it make any dent for families with a second or third child in child care.  The Taoiseach made no reference to child care in his speech.  These child care costs represent the major public priority in every major city in the country and the hardship being felt by hundreds of thousands of families is not addressed in this budget.  The lesson was not learned prior to and since the Meath by-election.  The stay-at-home spouse is still being severely discriminated against for making that choice, which was more than likely made in the interests of rearing children and is now being punished.  The allowance and extension in respect of widows and widowers is miserly in the extreme.The Government could have faced up to the reality of climate change and given some slight hint that it was aware that we now live in a carbon-conscious world.  However, the budget does nothing of the sort.  It displays the short-termism and the shocking casualness that goes from the very top to the very bottom of this Administration.  Even apart from living up to our international responsibilities, particularly to the poorer countries which will be hardest hit by climate change, though they contribute to it the least, there are the stark economic consequences for us at home in fines, higher costs, higher emissions and eventually greater failure.  Clearly action could have been taken in respect of heavier fuel using vehicles.  However, this has been put off to another day with another kite to be flown for rebalancing within the overall tax system.We are witnessing the early stages of a transformation of the global economy, driven the by the integration of 2.5 billion low-wage Chinese and Indian workers into the international trading system, rapid improvements in information and communications technologies, declining transport costs, climate changes and environmental degradation.  Many developing countries have replicated the strategies that made Ireland successful — low corporate taxes and skills availability — and can now make the goods and services that higher cost companies in Ireland make.  Camouflaged by a debt-driven property boom, the impact of these changes has appeared limited to date.  That will not remain the case.  The competitiveness pressures facing Ireland will become more intense than anything ever experienced before.Already, our international competitiveness has deteriorated under the Government's watch.  According to both the World Economic Forum and the IMD, Ireland's competitiveness rankings have dropped seriously over the past five years, reflecting a number of negative developments.  Ireland is now the most expensive country in the eurozone and prices here continue to rise faster than in most comparator countries.  Our share of world trade peaked in 2002 and has since been in steady decline.  While world trade grew by an average of 6%, in value terms, per year between 2002 and 2005, the value of Ireland's exports grew by an average of just 2% per annum in the same period.  Our manufacturing industries have lost over 32,000 jobs since the Government entered office.  As a share of total employment, manufacturing has declined from 15% to 11% and has been overtaken by the construction industry as the single largest employment sector in this country.  Ireland's balance of payments with the rest of the world shifted from a surplus as recently as 1999 to a deficit of €4.2 billion — 3% of GNP — in 2005.  According to the Central Bank, the latter will deteriorate to a deficit of €6.9 billion — 4.25% of GNP — in 2007.  These are not the achievements of a Government that takes the competitiveness of our industry seriously.The Minister for Finance suggested that the budget measures announced yesterday will help to restore some of the competitiveness lost over the lifetime of this Government.  Some of the individual measures are helpful.  I welcome them and they are to be commended.  A number of them were suggested by Fine Gael in recent months and years.  I welcome, for example, the tax simplification measures for small business and the incentives for the provision of risk capital for entrepreneurs and other innovative small businesses.However, much more needs to be done.  Tinkering around the edges will do little to address the cost competitiveness pressures faced by struggling Irish manufacturers and other exporters.  Some of the pressures to which I refer are as follows: the escalating costs from the badly-regulated electricity, gas and waste sectors; the escalating costs of delays from an under-developed transport system; and the exorbitant costs of office space and industrial accommodation that are a result of our dysfunctional planning system.  One must also consider the escalating costs that are emerging as a result of the effective privatisation of water and sewerage schemes.  The latter will become a serious political issue in the near future, particularly when one considers that charges in Sligo are €5.14 per 1,000 gallons and that small businesses, ratepayers and farmers whose supplies are metered will be obliged to pay continually increasing charges going forward.Where are the policies to control Government imposed-costs in these sectors?  Where are the measures to support the retraining of those put out of work by import substitution?  If anything, the budget threatens to further undermine the competitiveness of small businesses and exporters.  The relentless and uncontrolled increases in current spending and taxation, the extra pressure on inflation, the further stoking of the property market and the construction sector, the failure to do anything about the dangerous rise in household debt are all bad for small businesses and exporters and they give rise to a deeper fragility in the vulnerable manufacturing and business sectors.  Construction inflation has risen and productivity and exports have fallen at a time when these sectors face critical challenges.This budget represents a missed opportunity to advance the changes in the tax system that are required to ensure Ireland plays its role in protecting the global environment.  Climate change, in particular, is one of the greatest economic and environmental challenges faced by Ireland and other high-income countries.  Instead of making difficult decisions, however, the Government prevaricated and delayed, and has promised to take action only after further analysis, consultation and reflection.  We are another report away from action.  It is as if the Government has only just realised that Ireland's energy consumption patterns are unsustainable from a competitive, environmental and security perspective.  The only significant commitment the Government has made is to set aside €270 million of taxpayers' money for the fines that Ireland will be obliged to pay for this Administration's failure to meet its emissions obligations under the Kyoto Agreement.  This is an appalling admission of failure on the part of the Government to honour the commitments to which it signed up in respect of that agreement.The Minister for Finance could have implemented proposals put forward by parties on this side of the House.  I refer, for example, to those contained in Fine Gael's policy document, Energy for the Future, which could have helped bring about real progress.  Among our proposals are the following: the introduction of legislation to compel all fuel retailers to blend bio-fuel into fuels such as petrol, diesel and home heating oil; the removal of all excise duty on bio-fuels produced from renewable energy crops — in practice, this would mean that producers would not be obliged to pay excise duty on the bio-fuels, which they produce, with the knock-on effect being that consumers would enjoy cheaper fuel at the pump; an open public competition for capital start-up grants for the establishment and operation of bio-fuel processing plants; and a requirement that all public transport and public service vehicles to convert, where practical and feasible, to using forms of bio-fuel, whether in their pure or blended forms.In his budget speech, the Minister did not refer to the appalling situation that obtains on the M50.  I refer here to the upgrading works, the opening of the port tunnel and the development of the new terminal at Dublin Airport.  This matter has not been addressed.  I recently put forward a number of practical proposals to the Taoiseach but there is no reference to them in the documents relating to the budget.Disposable incomes and private wealth are rising, but what all the new challenges to which I refer have in common is the need for competent public action across a range of areas, namely, education, health care, crime prevention, environmental protection, transport and urban planning.  Addressing these challenges will require private sector enterprise, combined with political leadership and competence.  However, the Government has lost the trust of the population to solve problems that require public action.  Confidence in public action has bled to death from a thousand cuts.  I refer here, for example, to the following: the culture of unaccountability, at official and political level, in respect of delivery; a lack of reforms to accompany benchmarking; a lack of investment in staff training and better management; the bungling of IT projects; and the shambles that is decentralisation.  With regard to the latter, the Minister's Budget Statement refers to a "presence" in the locations originally chosen in respect of the movement of 10,000 public servants, on a voluntary basis, inside three years.  The decentralisation project has been a complete and utter failure.The Government is comfortable with private affluence and public inefficiency.  These challenges require a relentless pursuit of efficiency across the economy, in both the public and private sectors.  The people of Ireland have been playing their part but the Minister for Finance and the Government have not.The Progressive Democrats appear to have been suffocated in the fumes given off by SUVs.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	117	It seems that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, still has doubts about them and took his own advice from many years ago by leaving them out.I understand that the prison system, which comes under the remit of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is seriously dysfunctional.  I also understand that the design capacity vis-à-vis bed capacity is completely out of proportion.  Spike Island, Shanganagh and the Curragh were closed.  There is one sniffer dog for the entire country and cocaine is the new recreational drug for people throughout the country.  There are over 250 prisoners in Cork Prison, which was designed to cater for 150.  I understand that there are 300 prisoners on early release who did not return when they should have done and many of them are running loose.  That is an appalling situation.  Also appalling are the number of attacks on elderly people, the most recent of which was perpetrated against a priest in County Kerry.The Minister for Finance stated that the concerns of the individual have been placed at the centre of the budget.  I hope I will not be obliged to raise again the incompetency of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in commenting on mental health.  As has been pointed out by spokesmen of the Fine Gael and Labour parties, the proportion of the health budget allocated to mental health has declined under this Government.  There is no fully equipped, multi-disciplinary unit in the entire country, 20 years after one was first recommended.It has been said that the budget places the individual at the centre of its concerns.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, feels that he can act to reduce waiting lists only on the basis of representations, let him speak to the parents of Jordan Kelly and understand their frustration.  Let them be a guide to the many others who suffer the same frustration, telling him face to face how all they got from the Government were boxes of pills and sheets of paper detailing how one should rear one's child.  That is the situation in 2006 in the area for which Deputy Tim O'Malley is responsible, and he should be ashamed.  If he wishes to make any reparation for his half-hearted apology, he should visit those parents and understand what they must deal with.The budget has not dealt with the problems of the homeless, and the Simon Community said in a press statement that 40,000 persons on the social housing list would receive very little support from the Government.  Some 5,000 families are currently homeless, 1,361 of them in this city.  I sometimes have occasion to walk along streets in the vicinity of Leinster House, and those huddled in doorways on a bad night in 2006 are an indictment of policy on homeless people in this country at a time when we can spend €5 billion on the day of the budget.I also very much regret that the budget has ignored something I view as a great challenge and opportunity for Ireland today, namely, immigration.  We have special responsibility in this matter, having exported our people not by the planeload or boatload but by the generation.  Now it is our turn to do our bit and live up to our responsibility to welcome the stranger.  It is not merely a matter of altruism, since the harsh reality is that we now need immigrants, those men and women who make such a dynamic contribution to our economy, and we will need more workers from overseas to sustain economic growth and prosperity in the years ahead.  Growth rates for the next ten years are forecast to average 4%, meaning there will be a requirement for at least 300,000 immigrants to work in the country's service industries.The budget proves that the Government is not planning for that challenge or opportunity.  Consequently, Ireland has already admitted hundreds of thousands of new residents without putting in place the services they and everyone else need to make our daily lives function.  The Government has effectively already added a new county to Ireland, the equivalent of the entire population of County Kilkenny.  That was completely unmanaged and unplanned.  True to form, on the benches opposite there is no one in charge.  For that reason, we now have the equivalent of 27 counties vying for public services already hopelessly incapable of meeting the needs of 26.The health service is already in crisis, and schools are unable to offer children a place.  It is our children, Irish and immigrant, who are paying such a high price for failures here.  There is a school in Tallaght with 200 children from overseas.  As Deputy Rabbitte has pointed out, many of them do not have English as a mother tongue.  Those children have been granted only two additional teachers to help them with their English.I understand basic numeracy, and according to the Department of Education and Science, if one has 14 non-national children in a school, one is allocated a language support teacher.  If one has 28 non-national children, one gets two such teachers.  However, if one has anything over that number, one still receives only two language support teachers.  Therefore, in a school in Tallaght with 200 children from overseas, the Department of Education and Science, whose job it is to provide for education, allows only two language support teachers.  As a consequence, teachers standing in front of those classes are unable to do their job, and the children are unable to reach their potential.  Such archaic, inflexible and restrictive conditions imposed by the Department of Education and Science should be scrapped forthwith.  If the conditions are not flexible or functional, none of the children can learn properly.Regarding immigration, we must create a system of public services that are fair both to Irish people and to those coming to work and live here.  We must ensure that living standards are protected, that our streets and roads are kept safe, and that our country remains wealthy and strong for generations to come.  It must be fair to the Irish and fair to the immigrant.  This budget does not achieve that, since it signally fails to recognise the reality.  In that alone, it is a singular failure.  I recommend to the Taoiseach that when he appoints his new Minister of State, he give that person responsibility for immigrant affairs attached to his own Department but acting cross-departmentally so that the many underlying problems can be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner.That is important, as we should learn from the mistakes of other countries.  We are currently attempting to deal with a situation in 15 or 20 years with which the United States contended for 200.  The Netherlands, once liberal, have now become introverted, and France has serious assimilation problems.  Ireland can now learn and provide the world with an example, based on our Christian and Celtic heritage, of how assimilation and real social integration can take place.At the end of the next decade, Ireland will celebrate the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  Those ten years will see further great change in our country.  They will also herald enormous change globally: the inexorable rise of China and India; the emergence of Russia as an energy superpower; the continuation of the problem of Israel-Palestine; and the outcome of struggles in Iran, Iraq and the Middle East generally.  There will have been two further presidential elections in the United States, with changes of direction and policy determined by the will of the American people.  We will have dealt with the consequences of Europe's decision on the EU constitution and on whether Turkey should join.  The African population will have increased by 50%, and 40 million English-speaking Indian graduates will have emerged into the marketplace.  People with a PhD or a master's degree can now be hired for relatively little in Irish terms.The Government has not planned for any of those challenges, and the budget has attempted to address only the Government's failures to care for its people, and only for now.  It demonstrates yet again an inability to plan properly, target strategically, and implement successfully.  We introduced individualisation and did not plan for its impact on child care.  We failed to plan for the consequences of immigration, and when introducing tax systems to provide for nursing homes, no plan was put in place for a parallel system of high-dependency care that might be monitored with a degree of integrity regarding the level of decency, comfort and attention offered to the elderly.This budget demonstrates an inability to plan effectively, target strategically and implement successfully.  It does not correspond to my vision of an Ireland where the Government is accountable and there is an equal and sustainable society for all.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Expectations around a budget have never been so high and the reasons for this are straightforward. The revenue yield from taxation as compared with forecasts at the time of budget 2006 were further out than a lighthouse. No Minister for Finance since independence had so many resources available to him.The Government deliberately and calculatedly leaked its substantial contents in the days immediately preceding the budget.  Different audiences were targeted day by day.  The rhetoric was downbeat but the headlines were large. The pension would be increased to €208, the top tax rate would be reduced by 1%, mortgage interest relief would be increased and social welfare recipients would get an additional €20 per week. It is scarcely surprising that expectations were so high.  Hard-pressed families believed they were getting the trailer.  It turns out, however, that it was a matinee showing.The end product lacks sparkle. There is no innovation, nothing novel and nothing risky. There is no imagination, just a safe targeting of interest groups that might show an electoral dividend.  I welcome the positive features but I cannot help regretting what might have been achieved with €4 billion, a growth rate of more than 5% and a debt to GDP ratio of 25%. Once again, this Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government has favoured super-high earners in our economy and has failed to use the resources to relieve the strain on our society.The Labour Party welcomes any reduction in taxation that will improve the living standards of people on low and modest incomes.  Economic growth in our economy, coupled with wage and price inflation, means the tax code can and should be adjusted each year.  That is the natural order of things.  The question is not whether the tax code should be changed but how best to use the resources available. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have made their choice.  They have chosen to target resources at the better off and the super-wealthy. For years, they have delayed, obfuscated and delayed again in closing off tax loopholes that allow millionaires to pay no tax. In this budget, they have gone a step further by introducing tax cuts which skew resources to the better off.Let us be clear. A 1% cut in the top rate of tax delivers more than €2,000 to a person with an annual income of €250,000. It gives nothing to someone on €32,000. The ready reckoner published by the Department costed a 1% cut at €228 million in a full year.  This money is disproportionately targeted at people on high incomes. It provides some €2,000 extra for the person earning €250,000 but nothing for the person on the average industrial wage.The budget tables tell their own story. Regrettably, the fictional families no longer have names; we all miss Duncan and Mary.  Taking all the tax, PRSI and levy changes together, a married couple with one income of €30,000 gets €530 from the budget.  The same couple on €200,000 gets €1,953. A married couple with two incomes on €30,000 gets €680, while the same couple on €200,000 gets €3,370. A single person on €30,000 gets €400, while a single person on €200,000 gets €1,913, almost five times more than his or her counterpart earning €30,000.The motivation is purely political. There is no efficiency case for this cut. Where reform is needed is in the standard rate tax band, where people on or just above the average industrial wage are this year paying tax at 42%, PRSI at 4% and the health levy at 2%.  Last year, a single person with a salary between €32,000 and €46,600 faced a marginal tax rate of 48%.  The budget has increased the standard rate band by €2,000, or 6%, and the PRSI threshold by €2,200, or 4.7%. Wage inflation next year is forecast to be some 5.5%. This problem, therefore, remains unaddressed.  The Minister's estimate for the average industrial wage for next year is €33,000. This means a person who earns only 3% more than the average industrial wage will next year again pay nearly half of any overtime or bonus in tax and PRSI.Of the 50 stealth taxes introduced or increased by the Government after the last election, the non-indexation of the standard rate band was the greatest of them all. Psychologically, this means people have limited incentive to add to their income because almost half of any overtime or bonus is paid in tax.  That is bad economics. It is a pressure point which directly results from the Government's need to hoover up money in 2003 and 2004 to pay for the last pre-election splurge. It is a pressure point which is not addressed by cutting the top rate of tax.If cutting the top rate of tax is so important and helps to reward work, why not reduce the bottom rate also? Why was it so important to cut the top rate of tax but not the bottom rate? Why were the available resources not focused on increasing the standard rate band?  One of the most striking elements of the budget is that the Government has decided to completely jettison its promise to the electorate that only 20% of taxpayers would pay tax at the higher rate. This was a promise made in the programme for Government and to the social partners in the recent partnership agreement. It has now been simply dumped.  Instead, we are treated to a magnificent piece of sophistry which runs to six full pages, C23 to C28.  This is fantastic stuff that merits close reading. There are two wonderful pages of dense, learned-sounding exposition and a further three pages of sums.  It is complete balderdash; first-class, grade A, 18-carat balderdash.  Let us reduce this to the simple arithmetic that it is.  Average tax rates equate to one's tax bill divided by one's income. Marginal rates are the amount one pays on the last euro of one's earnings.  The Government promised, clear as crystal, that only one in five would pay tax at the top rate. This promise was not made in terms of average tax rates, effective tax rates or anything else. It is that simple.Before the budget, it was expected that 34% of taxpayers would pay at the top rate.  Since the standard rate band increase is close to the expected rate of wage inflation, that position will not change after the budget, no matter what balderdash is cooked up for the Minister.  I find it disappointing that the Department of Finance would go along with this kind of deceit.  The Department has rewritten the time-honoured presentation of the different categories of taxpayer to meet a political purpose — a broken political promise.I hope we have not reached the stage that because of one-party Government the Civil Service is beginning to feel the pressure and the need to bend the knee to every political whim of its masters.  For as long as I have been a Member, the presentation was simple.  There were essentially three categories of tax band — those exempt, those paying the standard rate and those at the top rate.  This year the entire presentation of the tax bands in the Budget Statement has been changed.  There has been a redesignation of the categories — those exempt, those paying at 20% or less and those paying at greater than 20%.  The fiddling of the presentation allows the political promise that only one in five taxpayers would be paying the top rate to continue.  Will a person above the average industrial earnings of €34,500 be liable to pay tax at 41%?  The answer is "Yes".  No amount of dividing it into income changes will alter that.  If I have the wealth I can pay €50,000 to my pension scheme.  What is my average tax payment?  This is a fundamental misrepresentation.  The Government promised only one in five taxpayers would pay at the top rate.  The figure is closer to 34% or one third.  The Department of Finance protects itself of course in carefully argued sophistry in the Budget Statement.  For example, it states:Based on the latest historical data ... an estimated 31.7% of income earners ... are liable to income tax at the higher rate for 2006.  [That is my understanding too.] The corresponding projected figure for 2007 on a pre-budget basis is that 34.7% of income earners are liable to tax at the higher rate...Given that the amount of increase in the standard rate tax band is approximately the same as projected price and wage inflation, about one third of taxpayers will continue to pay at the top rate.  Some Members have been around long enough to remember Gene Fitzgerald and Mr. Haughey.  I hope having one party permanently in office does not bring us back to the ways of the ancien régime.One feature of the budget that has received little attention is the continuing progress of the individualisation agenda.  Before individualisation, a married couple could fully transfer their tax allowances or bands to reduce their tax bill.  It meant a couple could pay tax at the 20% rate, up to €68,000.  Today, they pay tax at the high rate on €25,000 of their income, up from €23,000 last year.  This issue is a real source of annoyance to many couples, including those with young children.  Where one partner makes the decision to take time out of the workforce to care for children, they feel discriminated against by the tax system.  It is, or should be, a principle of child care policy that we respect the choices of parents in how they care for their children.  If a parent makes the choice to reduce their income in order to spend time with their family, the State should respect that decision.Last year, the Minister for Finance pretended to the House that he was tackling the phenomenon of millionaires who do not pay tax, a matter which Deputy Burton raised consistently.  The Budget Statement contained a heading, A Minimum and Fair Tax, in which the Minister stated:We cannot stand over a situation in which some high-earning tax residents, through the use of incentive reliefs, can reduce their taxable income to nil.  This is simply not fair...I agree with those laudable sentiments.  The Labour Party, and my colleague Deputy Burton, made the case for years.  We were delighted that we had finally pressurised the Minister into acting.It turns out, however, that he had a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem of millionaires who pay no tax.  First, he produced a new way of presenting the data, ensuring no one could be reported as paying zero tax in future, partly by including DIRT in the calculation of income tax.  Has one ever heard such a blatant contrivance?  It is as if these millionaire tax avoiders were the little old widows with a few bob in the post office and were liable to DIRT.  They are not paying zero tax anymore, they are paying tax on DIRT.  Many of them were not paying tax on DIRT when they should have been but that is another story.  Second, the Minister produced a complicated formula to restrict the extent to which individuals could avail of reliefs.  The spin was that it was essentially a minimum effective tax rate on people earning €250,000.  Of course, it was nothing of the sort.  The formula, when the detail appeared in the Finance Bill, does not apply to all reliefs, and particularly not to the much favoured relief for super private clinics.  In any case, the formula would not apply until 2007.  So, once again, the super wealthy will get to pay no tax.In that context, we should be cautious about the range of incentives being opened up by the changes to the business expansion scheme.  I do not want to be in any way dismissive as there is a need to look at the available sources of venture capital, particularly for high-tech start-ups.  There is a new breed of entrepreneur who has worked in the high-tech sector, perhaps in a multinational.  They understand the enterprise culture of the high-tech area and are willing to make a go of it on their own.  My colleague, Deputy Quinn, has been concerned for some time that there may be an issue with early seed capital for such ventures.  If the Minister's proposals address that problem, then I will welcome them.  However, if this is simply another way of opening up tax breaks to replace those he is talking about shutting down, then I will not.Those fears could be simply allayed by introducing a minimum effective tax rate of 20% on incomes over €250,000.  The tax code could be used in a selective way to promote socially desirable ends.  It should not allow, however, individuals the chance to avail of those schemes to the point where they pay little or no tax.  Equity is an important principle in taxation.  The system should be fair and seen to be fair.  As Fianna Fáil has systematically undermined the fairness of the tax system, we are entitled to consider the changes to BES in that light.We also look askance at the proposals on mortgage interest relief.  The further anticipated increase in interest rates today will wipe out the effect of yesterday's mortgage interest relief measures.The Labour Party welcomes the increases in social welfare announced in the budget.  Progress has been made on the adequacy of payments, which is important.  However no attention has been given to reforming the social welfare system, which is badly needed.  We have gone from having Deputy Dermot Ahern, whose lack of interest in the portfolio was manifest, in charge, through the savage 16 cuts of Deputy Coughlan, to Deputy Brennan.  He talks a superb game and I have admired his PR for more years than anyone in the House.

The time has come for additional resources to be targeted at families with children on low incomes as the Minister professed to do.  The NESC is considering a proposal to institute a targeted income supplement, either as a supplementary child benefit or as a refundable tax credit.  That proposal has been sent to the NESC to be studied.  This means it will probably die a slow and quiet death.  If the Government were serious about this it would have adopted the idea as its own.  However it has no intention of introducing the scheme.The children's author JK Rowling put it eloquently when she wrote:Poverty is a bad place to be on your own, but the worst place on earth if you have a child with you.  We will never know how much talent and ability has been stifled in poverty over the centuries but we can be sure that we will continue to live with ill health, crime and addiction until we succeed in eradicating it from as many children's lives as possible.There is a direct link between child poverty and the poverty of imagination in our Government.There is the question of how lone parents are treated in the social welfare code. Deputy Brennan has published some proposals on this, and while there are genuine concerns about how they might be implemented, they have merit. It is past time that we got beyond the anachronistic idea that being a parent is a problem, and the farcical situation that prevents lone parents from entering into long-term relationships for fear of losing their incomes.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	158	As I said, there were welcome features in this budget, but the imagination deficit meant that the real issues which affect real people in their real lives were dodged.  The budget contains few reforming measures, either of specific spending areas or the budgetary process.  Once again, the budget confirms that Fianna Fáil and the PDs are determined to privatise health care. More money has been provided for home care packages, rather than for running a proper system of home helps.  The Government could have used the budget to set out a new direction for the health service. It could have set useful targets for the building of new hospital beds, and new step-down facilities. It could have set out capital envelopes for these objectives and started to get on with the job. Instead, we will have to wait until January for the new national development plan, which will be a cross between Transport 21 and the last national health strategy. These were both great works of fiction, which could have been written by JRR Tolkien for all the relevance they had to the real world. Lavish promises will be made, and huge sums of money will be mentioned.The people queuing in accident and emergency departments tonight do not need glossy plans and lavish promises. They need hospital and community care beds. This budget should contain detailed plans and funding for both. It contains neither. Instead, we are told to depend on tax-financed construction of super-private clinics on scarce public land. Once again, instead of treating health care as a community service, we will get more for-profit medicine, and more tax breaks for the wealthy. That is what Fianna Fáil now stands for.The budget should have announced the ending of the disastrous scheme to build super-private clinics with taxpayers' money on scarce public land.  It is a scheme that will fundamentally alter the nature of health care in Ireland, and for which the Minister for Health and Children sought no mandate and has no mandate.The so-called national child care strategy stalled yesterday.  There was nothing new to announce but the priority should have been pre-school education.  The Labour Party is committed to universal free education at primary, secondary and third level.  It should also apply at pre-school.  The benefits of pre-school education for children, and for society, are well researched, well established and considerable.  The Government will find no better investment than investment in our children.Such an investment would also have made a huge impact on the problem of poverty and disadvantage.  It sounds as if it could not be done but it would have cost approximately the same as cutting the top rate of tax.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten, or should I say eaten cake given that the Minister has chosen to favour the wealthy few.  Investment in free pre-school for all would still be paying dividends in 50 years' time but that would have required imagination.  The extension of maternity leave is welcome although it was promised last year.  It is a pity the Government did not see fit to bring forward proposals for a right to part-time work or to take a career break.This budget was also silent on education.  It is a sad commentary on how this Government functions that it can be committed to a knowledge economy but have nothing in the budget about education, particularly at primary level.  There is no understanding of the funding crisis that faces so many primary schools.  Education should be free but it cannot be cheap.  Irish primary schools are run on a shoestring through a confusing system of grants.  Inevitably, the energies of school principals in particular are devoted to fundraising and keeping the show on the road rather than to educational leadership.  A modest amount of money, about a third or less of what was spent on cutting the top rate of tax, would have revolutionised the funding of primary education in Ireland.  It would have a truly transformative effect on schools but the budget did not show that degree of imagination.The budget was also virtually silent on transport.  Is the Government ideologically hidebound or is it just disconnected from the everyday lives of people who rise at 6.30 a.m. to produce €4 billion for which the Minister for Finance expects so many plaudits by returning €1.6 billion to them?  Once again the money spent on the top rate tax cut would have paid for the 500 buses that Dublin Bus needs.  The Government persists in its refusal to provide buses while it waffles on about bringing in the private sector in the never never.  People want to get to and from work today and, whatever the merits of Transport 21, people need buses today.  We have quality bus corridors with no buses.  The Government speaks of bringing in the private sector.  Does it matter if the bus driver is wearing a private or public sector jersey as he tries to drive through the streets of Dublin?  That is not the issue.  The only immediate solution, as proposed by Roisin Shortall in the document published by the Labour Party, is more buses now.  There is no reference to that in this budget.  The list goes on.  There is no understanding of the real needs of real people.Issues, vulnerability and uncertainties confront the economy.  There is over-reliance on construction for jobs growth and the property market is delicately poised.  Growth relies on domestic demand rather than on export-led demand to a far greater degree than it did before.  Inflation is too high and needs to be managed.  In a small open economy in a monetary union, excess inflation means loss of competitiveness and loss of employment.I would like to have heard the Minister for Finance address those issues.  I would like to have heard a meaningful presentation on the medium-term prospects for the economy and how we can ensure more and better jobs through investment in people and infrastructure.  I would like to have heard some real thinking on climate change, not just a proposal to pay for our failure to address it.  I would like the Minister for Finance to address the question of economic management in anything other than a patronising manner.Value for money is one element that he really should have addressed.  In a small open economy in a globalising world, the competitiveness of the Irish economy depends on having a lean, agile Government, capable of responding to emerging needs.  It means having a system of public expenditure management that can deliver value for money.  Failure to do so imposes competitive costs on the economy and reduces the standard of living for our citizens.  This budget made no mention of reform in this area.  The Minister has disregarded the report published by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The record on budgetary reform amounts to publishing the economic review and outlook in the autumn rather than in the summer and leaking the details of the budget for electoral advantage.  That is regrettable, a missed opportunity and a cost to the economy.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Tá mé ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis na Teachtaí Morgan, Cowley agus Ó Murchú.  Bhí a lán daoine ag caint faoin gcáinaisnéis mar cháinaisnéis a bheadh, ar bhealach amháin nó bhealach eile, glas.  It is clear we did not get a green budget.  It was a half-hearted, short-sighted and profoundly conservative exercise and, given the amount of expectation, quite disappointing.  Many commentators have described the budget as unimaginative.  It is worse than that, it is not prudent.  It lacks direction and does not address the fundamental economic and social challenges that have been staring our society in the face for many years.There are many explanations for the Government's failure to deliver the promised green budget.  Perhaps it is due to this Government's deeply rooted inability to plan ahead or because the Government has lost sight of the national interest, instead prioritising its narrow, partisan electoral interests, defined by its main backers.  Perhaps the Government's failure stems from its Ministers being unwilling and unable to comprehend what it means to be ecological or think in a green way.Green means sound economic, social and environmental policy based on solid analysis.  It means securing economic development and social inclusion for children today and their children in future decades.  Green means dependable, efficient public services.  Green means decent services, not handouts to the most vulnerable in society.  If yesterday's budget was green the Minister would have taken substantial measures to reduce the cost of child care and ended the means test on children's allowance.  Green means warm well-insulated housing and high quality, accessible acute health care services.  It means smart reforms of stamp duty to help first-time buyers, those who are downsizing and those with disabilities who need to move to an accessible house.  Unfortunately, that has been overlooked by the Government.It would mean progressive rather than regressive tax changes.  This is not to say I do not welcome a number of aspects of the budget.  Grants for planting bioenergy crops have improved, there are much-needed social welfare increases and measures to support small business and remove much bureaucracy are also very important.  We depend on small businesses and I hope they will be the survivors when other economies, particularly in Asia, rob us of much of our foreign direct investment.In addition to these specific measures, I welcome the Minister's admission after ten years in Government that environmental protection and economic progress can go hand in hand.  Any economist knows that without a healthy environment or secure energy supply, a thriving economy  is impossible.  The Minister is at least paying lip service to this important principle.To be clear, this budget is not green, and any attempt by the Government parties to paint it so is disingenuous and politically mischievous.  In speaking about energy security and climate change, Nero would have been proud of the Minister's performance yesterday.  The Minister, wrapped in a toga, should have been holding a small musical instrument, most likely a lyre from the time, while he made his speech.  Climate change and energy supply are the biggest economic, social and environmental issues facing us and the Minister is, in effect, fiddling while Rome burns.The Minister put the environment section of his speech high up in his script yesterday, but when I looked at the substance of the budget I was profoundly disappointed.  The Minister spent most of his time speaking of past schemes and those which are simply being continued.  Of the €300 million in new money announced yesterday relating to climate change, €270 million is being put into the carbon fund.  Due to its own failures, the Government is sending the money out of the country instead of investing it in establishing a secure energy supply, creating jobs and supporting enterprise.Where is the cost-benefit analysis on this expenditure?  Like so many other elements of this Government's expenditure, there is none.  For example, there was no cost-benefit analysis on the runway plan for Dublin Airport either.  The €270 million being sent out of the country can be juxtaposed with the budget from 1987 when the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, was declaring how scandalous, regressive and objectionable it was for money to leave the country.  The current Minister is boasting about sending €270 million out of the country, which is scandalous.This is precisely the type of ex post facto expenditure referred to by the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.  It is too late and too much, with no economic, social or environmental return.  I note the Government will attempt to shoehorn the Carbon Fund Bill into next week’s Dáil schedule, pushing it through without any serious debate.  Our Ministers are so embarrassed by this policy failure that they would not have any substantial debate on the floor of the House.I should make the Green Party's position on this legislation very clear.  It is a symbol of the Government's complete failure on climate change policy.  The Government's figures predict a 35 million tonne overshoot for the five-year Kyoto commitment period from 2008 to 2012, and while the EU is meant to cut transport emissions by 5% on 1990 levels, Ireland's transport emissions have increased by 150%.We must invest money in combating climate change in Ireland.  We should invest money in warm and well-insulated houses for first-time buyers, and we should also transform the Carlow and Mallow sugar factories into ethanol-producing plants that would give us some fuel security, as well as helping our Kyoto commitments.  Dr. Mike Hopkins of Dublin City University has pointed to several alternatives, stating for example that more money could have been invested in biofuels, bringing savings in reducing heating and wastage.The investment of €20 million in the greener homes scheme is spectacularly underwhelming.  In a €60 billion budget and a country falling short of its Kyoto target by 35 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, it is a drop in the ocean.  To be honest, it is spin and nothing short of fraud.The Minister's promises to consult on VRT and motor tax show a distinct political weakness.  Is the Minister afraid to take his courage in his hands and make a decision before consulting the motor industry?  The Minister's so-called environmental measures even fail the green-wash test.  Responding to yesterday's budget, Friends of the Earth observed that the Government's cop-out is complete.  If Deputy Brian Cowen was meant to be Santa Claus, the Irish people must be wondering what they have done wrong, as all he has given future generations is quite literally a lump of coal.  The Government pays lip service to "the polluter pays" principle but the taxpayer is footing the bill in a completely irrational and unjust way.The tax measures introduced are typically regressive, giving €150 to a single person earning €150,000 but only €35 to those earning €20,000 per year.  This budget is exacerbating inequality and is failing to assist the working poor.  The Government's attempt to obscure that it has broken its promise that middle-income earners would not pay tax at the higher marginal rate is desperate, transparent and pathetic.  The promise was made on the basis of nominal rather than effective tax rates and I urge the Deputies opposite to stand and acknowledge that the Government has broken this promise to voters.The would-be first-time buyer, those on social housing waiting lists and the hard-pressed young family trying to keep up with spiralling mortgage repayments are being squeezed by this Government's failures.  I agree with Focus Ireland in its comments that the budget has failed to create a fair society.  I see nothing in it for the 43,000 households on social housing waiting lists and I do not see the Government implementing the National Economic and Social Council's recommendations to build 10,000 social housing units each year from 2007 to 2013.  While the extension of mortgage interest relief is welcome, it is simply necessary as the European Central Bank's probable decision to raise interest rates today will negate any value from the announced relief.Measures to help parents providing care for their children were conspicuous by their absence, and the Minister announced the extension of what is effectively a failed scheme.  We were waiting for some reference to education as we have the second-highest class sizes in primary school in OECD countries and the worst campus accommodation in Europe for third-level students, but we got nothing.  The M50 again came to a standstill this morning with just one accident, and the indications are there that the Government is living in a parallel universe when it comes to people's daily lives.I note the Minister for Health and Children is planning to spend €15 billion next year but with all this money being spent it is amazing the Government is getting it so wrong.  My father told me somebody rang him out of the blue saying they were raising funds for a major children's hospital in order to purchase a scanner.  My father asked me how after paying years of tax, he as a retired man was being phoned to be asked to pay for basic facilities in a hospital.  There are 13,000 people on waiting lists.  Why is the Government not implementing the national carers' strategy and why is there is no national positive aging strategy?  We have documents but no action.The Carers Association has observed that the budget does not go far enough, and full-time carers who do not receive the carers' allowance due to the means test are still left without any financial reward after the budget.  I have no doubt we will continue to get representations in this area.Why is the budget conducted in this way?  Why is there no debate in the Chamber in the months leading up to the Estimates and budget, as that is when the Government would get some level of awareness of what is happening beyond the rarefied confines of Government Buildings.  It would get an idea of long-term thinking, particularly from the Green Party, of how we need to plan ahead.  The Government would also hopefully see the point of our climate change targets Bill, which would set down what needs to be done if we are to ensure our economic well-being, quality of life and survival.  We could then plan around our limitations living on a finite planet.  The Government seems to think it can buy its way out of every problem but that will not continue.  The Stern report stated that unless 1% of global GDP is targeted at climate change, the world will face a recession on a scale that would put the First and Second World Wars in the shade.  Is that what the Government wants?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	160	A budget is not about winning elections.  It is not even about making everybody happy nor is it about satisfying the tiny minority of privileged individuals who support the Progressive Democrats.  It should be about understanding what is needed and meeting those needs where the revenue is available to do so, prioritising the least well off and ensuring high quality accessible public services to meet the needs of the population.  Is that what the budget does?  Does it prioritise the least well off?  Do those on low and average incomes gain most?  Is delivering public services a priority?  Does the budget set down a marker to address the deficiencies in health care and housing?  The answer is a resounding "No" to all these questions.Many aspects of the budget involve smoke and mirrors.  The Government is attempting to give the impression that it is doing things it is not.  The Government parties would like us to think that those on low incomes are the main beneficiaries of the budget.  While the lowest rates of social welfare, pensions and the minimum wage will increase, these are all long standing commitments, which were made before recent increases in the cost of living.  They are, therefore, not sufficient to keep people out of poverty.  Above all, these are deserved and overdue increases.Top earners do not deserve the windfall that will result from the reduction in the top rate of income tax.  Have they been paying more than their fair share of taxation?  The Government has tried to wrap this measure up and present it to us as "rewarding work".  Do those who are more than well rewarded deserve more than hard working people on low and middle incomes?  High income earners will share a €1.25 billion personal tax package.  They will receive the cumulative benefit of the increase in personal tax credits, the benefit of the widening of the standard tax band and they are the beneficiaries of the 1% reduction in the top rate.  High income earners will gain the highest increases in weekly pay as a result of this budget.  As IMPACT stated yesterday, they are "three-time winners" and if that is not enough, the Minister made a commitment to further reduce the top rate next year if returned to Government.As my colleague Deputy Ó Caoláin said last night, a remarkable feature of the budget is that those earning the average industrial wage — €30,000 per annum — gain least per week from the budget.  Workers on €30,000 per annum gain €8 per week compared to gains of at least twice as much per week by those earning more than €35,000.  This budget clearly increases inequality between the low paid and the high paid.  While those on the minimum wage are being taken out of the tax net, the key question is the increase in the minimum wage.  ICTU had argued for a minimum wage of €9.03 while Sinn Féin had put forward a proposal for €9.30.  The minimum wage will only be increased to €8.65 and this will be staggered in two instalments in January and July.It is disappointing that the Minister did not increase the restrictions on the use of specified tax reliefs for high income individuals.  Restrictions announced in last year's budget did not go far enough.  Ensuring that high income individuals pay their fair share of taxation demands that such restrictions be significantly increased.  No high income individual should be able to write off more than 10% of his or her earnings through such exemptions.  The Minister seems to think he has done enough on this matter but he has not.I welcome the introduction of the higher rate health levy of 2.5% for high income individuals earning more than €100,000.  It is an acknowledgment that high income earners do not pay their fair share.  That is not their fault because Government policy is the problem.  Sinn Féin has long argued for the introduction of a higher rate of income tax for earners on or above €100,000.  It is surprising that the Minister would choose to increase the health levy for higher income earners while failing to remove the PRSI ceiling.  The PRSI ceiling is fundamentally unjust, as it means that those whose income exceeds the ceiling pay a smaller proportion of gross income in PRSI than those earning less than the ceiling.  The increase in the health levy will raise €34 million a year whereas the abolition of the PRSI ceiling would raise €282 million.  This money would have augmented the social insurance fund and funded more significant increases in welfare rates or pensions.  It could have been used to ensure better redundancy entitlements for workers in vulnerable sectors whose jobs are increasingly moving to low cost economies.Another astounding feature of this budget is that it fails to help those hurt by increasing prices, particularly low income families who can least absorb these increases.  The €4 increase in the fuel allowance is paltry.  At a time of unprecedented energy price hikes, those struggling to afford to heat their homes will be shocked by this minuscule increase.  While the Minister announced an increase of €20 million for the greener homes residential renewable energy scheme, no specific measures were introduced to help low income families move to renewable energy systems.  Sinn Féin has called for full cost renewable energy grants for those on low incomes.  The costs involved in installing renewable energy systems remain prohibitive for those on low incomes while these grants cover only a small proportion of the cost.The Minister made no announcement yesterday regarding the warmer homes scheme, which provides funding for insulation and other energy efficiency measures in approximately 2,000 eligible homes each year.  Sinn Féin proposed additional funding to enable the scheme to meet the needs of 10,000 homes a year, which would have cost only €8.45million.  It would have reduced heating costs for low incomes families suffering as a result of ESB and gas price hikes and reduced energy wastage but the Minister chose to do nothing.  A total of 62,000 families live in persistent fuel poverty and the Minister has utterly failed them.He was at pains to give the impression that the environment is a priority for the Government.  The Minister tried to convince us that the purchase of a further €270 million worth of carbon allowances is an environmental measure but that is a stunt.  Taxpayers should not have to bear this cost.  Had the Government acted to reduce emissions, it would not be forced to purchase these allowances.  Ireland should aim beyond the Kyoto Agreement, which merely represents a minimum level with which all states should comply.At first the changes in VRT sounded promising.  Sinn Féin has long demanded that VRT be based on emissions output.  However, the Government will instead engage in consultation on this and it will not do anything.  The higher rate of motor tax announced for high emitting vehicles will not be introduced for more than a year and, even then, it will apply to vehicles registered after January 2008.  Why is the Government purposely giving people a year's notice of this measure?  It amounts to giving people a year to purchase their SUV and face no penalty in increased motor tax, which is ludicrous.Lest Sinn Féin be accused of being entirely negative, the Government has done much for small business and indigenous business in the budget, which is welcome.  Sinn Féin has consistently argued for the Government to shift the focus from foreign direct investment to supporting the development and expansion of indigenous industry.  It is clear that there is a need to develop indigenous industry. The economy has become dangerously over reliant on both FDI and sectors such a construction, which cannot continue indefinitely.  We welcome the increased focus on research and development.  The levels of research and development in Irish industry have not been what they should have been.  However, if the Government was serious about supporting small business, as it pretends to be, it would not allow the disgraceful way that the agenda of liberalising the energy market is damaging small business.  ESB prices are being pushed up to entice others into the market to compete with the ESB.  Prices are being pushed up to bring in competition, supposedly to bring prices down.  It does not make sense.  The increases announced by the ESB will hit low-income people hardest.  The increases demonstrate that the regulator is not upholding its duty to take into account the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and the elderly.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is not serving the interest of the people or of business.Before I conclude, I will make an important point in respect of spending in the health service.  The Minister announced record spending of €14.3 billion on health next year.  We have had record spending every year during the lifetime of this Government, but it has failed miserably to deliver efficient and equitable health care services to the people.  Money is being poured into a two-tier system that discriminates against the patient dependent on the public hospital system.  The health strategy has been binned.  The Minister for Health and Children's silly and illogical private hospital collocation plan is starting to unravel with the news that the proposed hospitals at Letterkenny and Galway will not go ahead.  The Government and the HSE cannot agree how many additional hospital beds we need.  Public money should be spent in the public system only, with equal access for all based on need alone.I hope the Government will recognise the shortcomings it announced with yesterday's budget.  I look forward to a change of Government this time next year when, hopefully, those low-income families can be prioritised and we can get some more equality into the system.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I know there are some good things in this budget, but it lacks other things.  The opportunity to do so much for our people who are suffering has been squandered.  These are the people whom it was said the budget was aimed at.  However, compared to what is still undone, this budget has failed in this regard.I am very concerned because there are so many things to be done.  The greatest question of all concerns the billions of euro that were there to be spent.  Why was this money not used to good effect up to now?  Will the Government direct the money to where it is really needed?I am very concerned about older people in my constituency who must borrow money, maybe several hundred euro, to go to a basic hospital appointment.  It might be an older person who has nothing except a pension, yet he or she must borrow possibly €110 each way to go from Achill Island to Galway to have a pacemaker checked, which is absolutely ludicrous.  It does not make sense.  Yet, this person has nothing else.  This Government is failing this older person and so many others.  I asked a question in this House as to why this was happening.  I was told by the Minister for Health and Children that this was the responsibility of the HSE.  After questioning the HSE and receiving information from it, it was very clear it is not getting enough money to be able to provide the necessary transport.  Transport is limited to a number of categories, such as people receiving treatment for cancer, people with severe ischaemia of their lower limbs and dialysis cases.  These are very deserving cases, but even allowing for the transport of those in these categories, others do not have transport when they need it because provision for the categories I mentioned have eaten so much into the budget provided.  The pie is limited and even acute services are being jeopardised.How can we come out of a budget like this with such glaring inequities in our system?  A section of the population of older people must go into nursing homes.  Yet, the terrible position is that they will not have enough money to support themselves in a private nursing home, having been refused a place in a public facility because there are not enough public facilities.  This Government has managed to abdicate its responsibility to older people.  Therefore, they must search for a room at the inn in a private nursing home towards which the State will not give them adequate funds.  I welcome the increase in the subvention rate, but if it is not sufficient to cover the cost, what is the point?  Those people still face a glaring deficiency in their ability to even exist so this is a major problem.Older people waiting for five years simply to be called for an urology appointment and who maybe get up five times a night need an operation that would take 20 minutes.  It does not make sense.  This would be sorted out by the appointment of a urologist at Mayo General Hospital, which is not going to happen.  Neither do we do have a rheumatologist so people have to become completely crippled and miss that two-year window of opportunity to get the treatment they need to prevent them becoming totally seized up in the case of rheumatoid arthritis.  This is unacceptable.I do not know how the budget will address these issues.  I raised the position regarding psychiatric services in Mayo in this House.  Children there must wait for two years for a psychiatric appointment because there is only one child psychiatrist in Mayo, which is a massive county, the third largest in Ireland, with a population of over 110,000 people.  Yet, it has only one child psychiatrist.  Surely, all the billions of euro available could have been used to provide those services.  It is a question of prevention.  We saw this on television over the past few days.  Prevention is better than cure.  Older people and, above all, children who have their whole lives ahead of them but whose lives may be jeopardised or even prematurely ended by suicide, must wait for services.  These children urgently need to be seen by someone.  It is completely unacceptable and I ask the Minister to examine these issues.The recruitment embargo is continuing, despite all the billions of euro.  The embargo means that not enough staff can be employed to ensure, for example, the beds we need are available.  I questioned the Minister about this and received word about the transit lounge being set up in Mayo General Hospital where 15 beds will be provided.  However, this is just pending transfer to the ward.  In other words, transit lounges in our hospitals are the answer to the deficiencies there, which is unacceptable.I welcome transit lounges to the extent they are better than the totally inhumane situations found in accident and emergency departments where I have seen older people cry out of sheer desperation.  I once met a man of over 90 years of age in a hospital who was crying.  When I asked him what the problem was, he replied it was his birthday yet he was on a hospital trolley.  It would certainly have been better for him to have been in some kind of transit lounge, but he deserved to be in a hospital bed, which will not be there for him even after this budget.  I am very concerned about that.There is a major missed opportunity here.  Helicopter emergency medical service are so important and every other country in Europe has them.  Yet, children have died gasping for breath from diseases like meningitis trying to get from peripheral hospitals to the centres of excellence on the east coast for essential life-saving operations.  They cannot get there in time because of the lack of helicopter emergency medical services.  These are glaring deficiencies.I reiterate the call I made to the Minister for Finance after the last budget for some kind of tax incentive scheme to help businesses in the west in particular.  These businesses are struggling with such a short season, particularly the tourism season.  I asked that some consideration be given to VAT-free conferences in Ireland and I am glad this is happening and that concessions are available.  I am glad to see the improvements in the business expansion schemes, namely, the €2 million ceiling per company, which is much better, and possibly €180,000 per individual.  It helps smaller industries, which is good because the Government is very much regarded as a Government that favours big business.  The west deserves these measures.There is a total underspend in the BMW region, bearing in mind the €500 million allocation for roads.  According to the Minister for Finance, the deficit will not be made up until 2008 although the national development plan is to expire at the end of this month.  Between now and 2008, the east and south will continue to surge ahead, as they have done.  We must wait until 2008 for an even playing pitch, but even then the south and east will have moved on and 60% of graduates from the west will still have to go to the greater Dublin area to find their first job.  This could easily be sorted out if the Government put its money where its mouth is and supported very worthwhile initiatives in the west to ensure its competitiveness.  The west should be provided with the necessary road and rail infrastructure, broadband, etc.Coastal fishermen are receiving a pittance in compensation for the rest of their lives, amounting to approximately €2,000.  In the United Kingdom, drift-net fishermen were similarly compensated but at least they received an equitable amount.  This must be borne in mind.Post offices in rural areas depend so much on the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I recognise that efforts were made to improve postmasters' incomes.  However, EU competition law is such that their services will be put out to tender and this will seriously jeopardise their incomes.  The Government should consider how it can help in this regard.I welcome the 5,000 home care packages.  The defined revenue funding scheme for sheltered housing has great potential to keep people at home and out of hospitals and nursing homes, yet less than €1 million was allocated for the scheme last year to help people remain in their communities.  The ongoing revenue cost should be subject to support so that people could be employed to help the elderly stay at home or in sheltered housing in their communities for a longer period.  However, I heard no reference to this in the budget speech and I hope it will be considered because it is necessary.  It is a very important issue.The Government has totally destroyed the very clear vision of former Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, that 20% of all houses be made available to those in need of social or affordable housing.  The former Minister's vision was very equitable but we see in the newspapers that it is being watered down all the time.The need for social housing has increased as never before and there are 48,000 people on the waiting list.  Those who are making money are making more than ever before.  While private housing is thriving, social housing is in the doldrums.  House prices are such that one requires ten times the average industrial wage to reach the entry point for housing.  This is a terrifying statistic but indicates the current reality.  The recommendations in the NESC's report are being ignored.  Local authorities require resources and voluntary housing associations need sites on which to build houses.  They would build them if they could get the sites.The private rental housing subsidy serves as a blank cheque for private developers and really operates at the expense of the homeless and destitute.  We need more social housing targeted at low-income groups and vulnerable people, such as the elderly, homeless and disabled.  Ireland has the smallest social rental housing stock in Europe, with the exception of tiny Luxembourg.  I do not know what the Government is doing in this regard, given that it claims to look after those who really need help.This country has been asset-stripped of social housing and this process is continuing.  If the Government agrees with the NESC's targets, it must provide adequate resources.  The targets were identified in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, which is to expire at the end of this month, but they have not been achieved.  I hope the Government is prepared to avail of the great opportunities that exist.  It has a major responsibility in this regard but has abdicated it.I do not recognise the difference between older people requiring high-dependency care in a nursing home and requiring care in a hospital.  I do not know why the former should not be entitled to free care.  The Government should consider this aspect.The provision of free medical cards to those over 70 years was very important, even though there are millionaires with medical cards.  Older people who are totally disabled and require high-dependency care should be looked after at the State's expense.  It is their legal right in any case.  I hope this is taken on board.Not-for-profit housing enterprises should be supported very much by the Government, and much more so than at present.  While I welcome the home care packages, the defined revenue funding scheme really needs to be examined.The Government needs to reconsider the housing targets and complete 73,000 new social rental homes by 2012.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2002 should be re-examined.  These matters should all be addressed before the need to consider land swaps or cash payments in lieu of complete housing units arises.  The Government should undertake to provide building sites for social housing to local authorities and housing associations.  The Government needs to adopt a housing-first policy to resolve the homelessness problem.  Housing should be provided before the associated services pertaining to health, education and training.Significant additional revenue should be provided by the Government for housing associations to provide on-site care and support services in sheltered accommodation projects for the elderly.  This is extremely important.  So much more needs to be done and I ask the Government to consider the areas about which I have spoken.  The people deserve more.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	162	By any standards, this was a fairly historic budget.  With a package of over €1.4 billion, it delivers the largest increase in social welfare spending in the history of the State.  It is also a reforming welfare budget with a number of significant and fundamental reforms of social policy at its core.  Total social welfare expenditure next year will be €15.3 billion, or €1 in every €3 of day-to-day spending by the State.  Next year, this funding will directly support and benefit 1.5 million people.This budget is also about delivery and in that regard we have delivered on our commitments in the programme for Government by increasing the basic State pension to €200 per week and realising the 2007 target for the lowest social welfare rates.  The contributory pension has increased by €16 per week to €209.30 and other social welfare rates by €20 a week to €185.80.  A couple receiving the contributory pension will be almost €40 per week better off.The lowest rate of social welfare payment has increased by 12.1%, which is approximately three times the expected rate of inflation.  We are delivering on the pledge to tackle any remaining child poverty, which is simply unacceptable in the Ireland of the 21st century.  Reforms in this area include combining three rates of child dependant payments into a new single high-rate qualified child allowance of €22 per week, which will benefit over 340,000 children of families on social welfare.  This is in addition to increases of €10 in child benefit to over 1 million children, thus increasing the universal support available to at least €160 per month.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance has been increased by 50%.  The measures taken by me, and my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, in respect of carers have laid the foundations for a sustainable long-term care strategy.I have introduced reforms designed to make the social welfare code fairer to women and to bring about greater social gender equality.  It is only right that women should have a social welfare entitlement of their own and I have initiated several reforms to address this situation and also to facilitate them in entering the workforce.As well as massive income support improvements of over €970 million, another €430 million, or nearly one third of the total package, is being directed to support a range of reform measures.  These measures are, in particular, being shaped and aimed at confronting and tackling remaining child poverty, at recognising and supporting carers, increasing income supports for all pensioners and increasing the status and incomes of women pensioners.Everyone is entitled to a basic standard of living.  I have repeatedly stated my conviction that this generation will be judged on how it used the fruits of the economic miracle of recent years to help those most vulnerable in society, those most deserving of our support.  We have a responsibility to assist those who for reasons of age, health or other circumstances need the financial lifeline that is welfare support to help them through bad times and to offer hope and encouragement towards better times.  The principles of social solidarity underpin our social welfare system, and the programme of this Government which has committed itself to delivering a number of specific and ambitious improvements in social welfare rates by 2007.  At the core of these pledges was the commitment to bring the basic State pension to €200 a week.  I am pleased to have been able to deliver on that promise by increasing the non-contributory pension by €18 a week to €200 with effect from next January, and the contributory pension to over €209.The needs of older people have been, and will remain, a priority for this Government.  That has been repeatedly demonstrated by the numerous initiatives which have been taken over the years in the area of pensions, supports for carers and household benefits such as free electricity, gas and telephones.  For instance, since 1996, and including increases granted in the current year, pensions have increased by almost 119%, or approximately 57% in real terms, far ahead of both price and wages growth over the period.All the more recent indicators, including the latest EU survey on income and living conditions for 2005, show that progress is being made in significantly improving the well being of older people.  The survey found that consistent poverty rates for older people were at approximately 3.7%, and that was before the many benefits flowing from budget 2006 were taken into account, and the significant increases and improvements announced in yesterday's budget.I am also making significant progress on the Government's commitment to increase the level of the non-contributory State pension, the qualified adult allowance, QAA, for the spouses and partners of contributory pensioners.  The budget increase of €23.70 per week in the qualified adult payment will benefit some 35,500 couples.  These increases will bring the rate of qualified adult allowance payments for those aged 66 and over to 86.5% of the target rate contained in the Government commitment.There is now a €60 million commitment to reach that target rate inside the coming three years.  I also intend to introduce legislation in the spring which will provide for the qualified adults entitlement to the QAA for the duration of the entitlement of the State pensioner.  As most qualified adults are women, this decision will be of substantial benefit to them and will, in most cases, transform the QAA into what in effect is a woman's pension in her own right, as distinct from being a dependant.  I have also decided to include in the upcoming Social Welfare Bill the decision to have the payment made directly to the qualified adult.  It will, of course, remain open to any qualified adult to continue to have her portion of the pension paid jointly with the personal portion of the pension, if she so wishes.In budget 2006, for the first time in many years, I increased the basic income disregard for the purposes of the means test for non-contributory pensions to €20 per week.  At the same time I introduced incentives for pensioners on means-tested payments, who may wish to earn extra income to continue in employment, with €100 per week earnings disregard.  I am happy to be able to build on these improvements by increasing the basic means disregard to €30 per week, and at the same time building on the employment incentives provided this year by increasing the earnings disregard to €200 per week.  These measures will benefit approximately 26,000 pensioners a week who are in receipt of a reduced rate of pension.  As a consequence, for them the additional increases in the personal rate will be up to €10 per week while the qualified adult rate will further increase by up to €6.60 per week.These pensioners will also benefit from the general €18 per week increase in the personal rate of payment and, where relevant, the €11.90 increase in the QAA rate.  In other words, some non-contributory pensioner couples will gain by over €46 from these combined measures, with effect from next January.Over the past few years several improvements have been made to the household benefits package for older people and I have been pleased to be able to introduce further enhancements in this budget which, for instance, take account of changing trends in society and technological advances.With effect from next April, it will be possible for pensioners and others who qualify to have the free telephone allowance paid in respect of mobile telephones as well as fixed landlines.  This will allow older people to have more flexibility.  In all, over 320,000 people benefit from the telephone allowance this year.  Lest there be any confusion about this, the allowance is paid either for the mobile telephone or the fixed line, not for both.I am also extending the automatic entitlement to a free travel companion pass to pensioners aged under 75 who are medically unfit to travel unaccompanied.  I am also pleased to confirm that early 2007 will see the start of the introduction of all-Ireland free travel which will allow all Irish pensioners to travel throughout Northern Ireland free of charge on public transport, while Northern pensioners will be able to do likewise here.The Government is concerned about retirement income in general, now and in the future.  I do not need to remind the House of the demographic pressures our pensions system will face but while we face a pensions problem, many other countries with less favourable demographics, face a crisis.  It is important that we use the time we have available to act now to find the solutions for tomorrow.Everyone is entitled to adequate income, dignity and security in his or her retirement.  I am determined that we work towards delivering adequate retirement income to all our citizens which does not place an unsustainable burden on future taxpayers.  In this regard, the two reports published by the Pensions Board over the past year, The National Pensions Review and Savings for Retirement, require serious debate and analysis before we decide finally on the type of retirement income we want for our older people and the contribution we will make during our working lives to that future.I was very pleased at the prominence afforded to pensions in the social partnership negotiations for Towards 2016, and the final agreement features several commitments in this area.  As part of the agreement, the Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions by next March outlining the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.  After a consultation process, the Government will develop a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.  This is the end of a process, commenced over two years ago, and I am confident that it will deliver a system that will command broad acceptance and provide the way for people to accumulate adequate resources for their retirement.Before I leave the whole area of older people, I would like to refer briefly to an issue about which I have received many representations, namely, the difficulties confronting people, especially older people, in adequately heating their homes in an era of rising energy prices.  Last year, I increased the fuel allowance by €5 a week to €14 and this year I am increasing it by a further €4 to €18 a week.  This means that the level of the fuel allowance, which had not moved for many years and is paid to 274,000 recipients, will have doubled in the past two years.  I am also taking the opportunity virtually to double the means test from €51 to €100, the disregard taken into account before one is refused the means test.This is not the only measure being taken to address fuel poverty and to alleviate the worries of elderly people.  As the Taoiseach announced last September, and as and from next January, the number of free units of electricity and gas paid under the household benefits scheme will increase by 600 units a year to 2,400 units at a cost of €50 million.I am particularly keen to reform the social welfare system so that it reflects the changes in our society in recent years and keeps pace with the changed nature of working and living conditions that we have witnessed.  In this regard, the social welfare system should be responsive to the changing nature of the role of women in society.  Many women, because they do not have a history of social insurance contributions or a recent attachment to the labour market, are not entitled to a social welfare payment in their own right.  Rather, their position is recognised by way of the qualified adult allowance or increase which is added to their husband's or partner's payment.  Some modernisation has already taken place.  Since 2002, couples can apply to have the qualified allowance paid directly to the spouse or partner rather than as part of the primary payment.  There is already full entitlement in terms of the non-contributory State pension where, subject to meeting the means test, both partners may receive a pension in their own right.  As I previously indicated, I intend to establish the qualified adult's entitlement to the QAA for the duration of a pensioner's entitlement and to have the QAA paid directly to the qualified adult.I also propose to significantly reform the manner in which spouses and partners are assessed as qualified adults across a range of social assistance schemes and, in particular, the treatment of part-time and low-paid work undertaken by qualified adults.  The proposed reform involves assessing both members of a couple in a similar manner, with common disregards and assessments applying to both.  Additionally, I will be removing the poverty traps that are present in the current method of assessment.  For example, currently, at certain income levels if a woman increases her income from part-time employment to over €100 per week, her spouse or partner can lose €1.20 from his jobseeker's allowance for every €1 she earns in excess of the disregard.  Clearly, this situation has no place in a modern system of employment supports.Under the proposed reforms, increases in labour market participation will instead be rewarded and this will facilitate women to move beyond the occupational cul-de-sac of indefinite part-time employment with earnings kept below €100 per week.  Both partners will now be able to claim jobseekers allowance in their own right, although subject to certain conditions.  This will also facilitate women, in particular, to access the range of employment supports and training opportunities that go with receipt of the jobseeker's allowance.  I am confident these proposals will significantly reduce the complexity in the present system while recognising and rewarding increased labour market participation, especially by women.I have taken the opportunity presented by the budget to address an issue raised with me recently by several Members in regard to the earnings thresholds for recipients of deserted wife's benefit, DWB.  In response to these representations, I considered it appropriate to introduce a new single earnings limit of €20,000 gross earnings, even though the scheme has been closed to new applicants since January 1997.  In addition, once claimants' earnings go over this limit, they will now be entitled to a new half-rate, transitional payment for six months to ease the impact of losing entitlement to the payment.  Over 2,300 DWB claimants will benefit from these revisions to the scheme which will bring it more into line with other social welfare schemes.Finally, I am pleased to be able to introduce two small but beneficial measures which will assist widows and widowers at a particularly difficult time in their lives, in the immediate aftermath of the death of their spouse.  Financial worries add to the stresses experienced at such times.  Not only do widows and widowers have to cover the cost of a funeral but often they also have to cope with the loss of an income as well as deal with the personal trauma.  The six weeks after-death payment paid to the survivors of social welfare recipients are intended to ease this financial strain.  In addition, my Department makes once-off payments to assist with immediate costs.  I am pleased to be in a position to announce two significant improvements with effect from today.  The widowed parent grant will be increased by €1,300 to €4,000 while the bereavement grant will be increased by €215 to €850.  I hope these increases will help in some way.Carers play a valuable, and much valued, role in our society.  It is important that we support and care for them.  Since taking office in 1997, the Government has been committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum extent possible.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.As a result of these improvements there are now almost 28,500 carers in receipt of either carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  These carers also receive a respite care grant, as do over 8,300 other carers who do not qualify for carer payments.  Our commitment to carers has been further reinforced in the new national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, which includes significant commitments in the area of caring.In particular, the development of a national carer's strategy has been identified as a priority action in terms of supporting people with caring responsibilities.  This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason, all relevant Departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  This type of cross co-operation is also reflected in the Towards 2016 commitment that my Department lead a structured consultation process involving all relevant Departments and agencies as well as carer representative groups.  This process is to involve an annual meeting of these stakeholders.  I am pleased that the first such meeting has already been held and that the issues raised there have informed the package of measures for carers which I am announcing today.In 2005, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children and I established a working group on long-term care which was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprised senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my Department.  The task of the working group was to identify policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care.  I am pleased that the role and needs of family carers were recognised in that group's work and this influenced not only last year's budget package but also the commitments in Towards 2016 and this year's budget package.In the context of continued developments in areas such as needs assessment and home care packages which are designed to facilitate people in being cared for in their own homes for as long as possible, I am delighted to announce further improvements to the income supports available to carers which build on the significant improvements made in recent years.  As I stated on many occasions, the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support.  As a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  The rule has been that people qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of one social welfare payment when they become carers.  The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs made very specific recommendations in this regard.Accordingly, I am delighted to announce the introduction of fundamental structural reforms in this area.  In future, people in receipt of another social welfare payment, who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, equivalent to a half-rate carer's allowance.  The precise details of this arrangement are currently being examined by my Department and will be set out in legislation next year.Abolishing the old rule that one cannot receive two welfare payments means that, for the first time, people who are caring can have some real recognition of their caring duties.  I thank the joint committee for its unanimous recommendation along these lines which I am pleased to accept.  Under this new dual payment system we will start to recognise the carer's allowance less as a welfare payment and more as a support for caring duties.  I consider this reform to be an important step forward and I am determined to press ahead with other needed reforms in this area.As in previous years I am also increasing the rates of payments for carers so that, with effect from next January, the rate of carer's allowance will increase to €200 for carers under age 66 and to €218 for carers over 66; and the rate of carer's benefit will increase by €20 to €200.70 per week.  In addition, I am pleased to announce an increase of €300 in the rate of the respite care grant to €1,500 from June next year.  This will allow up to 40,000 carers to have a well-deserved break from their caring duties.  I have also increased the level of income disregards for carer's allowance to €320 per week for a single person and to €640 per week for a couple.  This means a couple with two children can earn up to €36,240 and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.  Similarly, I have increased the level of the income threshold for carer's benefit to €320 per week.  These improvements in the income supports available from my Department, together with the improvements in home care and related services announced by the Minister for Health and Children, represent a further realisation of our vision of a co-ordinated approach to services and supports for carers in the community.  The full package of measures I am announcing for carers will cost in excess of €107 million in a full year and are further evidence of the Government's commitment in this area.On various occasions I have described child poverty as an unacceptable blight on society.  Childhood deprivation can leave lasting marks on children by stunting their development and limiting their life chances.  It is not just the child who suffers — society also loses, for its children are its wealth.Since my first days in this portfolio I have been determined to make a lasting impact on child poverty.  It is a complex area that does not lend itself to easy solutions.  Overall, it requires an integrated, whole-of-Government response as envisaged in Towards 2016 which lays out an ambitious programme of priority actions over the years.  However, in the meantime, I am committed to an even stronger and more focused campaign in an all-out commitment to end child poverty in 21st century Ireland.In recent years we have lifted more than 100,000 children out of poverty and now we must strive to complete the task.  I have long held the view that implementing a second tier of payment for children in low income and welfare families is the most effective method of targeting child poverty.  I see this improved and targeted allowance as representing a substantial move in that direction and that is why in this budget I have deliberately taken the decision to focus increased child supports in this area.In recent years, resources have been directed towards alleviating child poverty via substantial increases in child benefit, CB, which, as the House knows, is paid right across the board, rather than through the other mechanism of child dependant allowances, CDA, which are paid to recipients of social welfare payments.  While these have not been increased since 1994, the combined value of child benefit and CDA has increased over that period by more than three times the rate of inflation.In terms of tackling work disincentives, the shift towards child benefit has been significant, from a position in 1994 where it represented only 27% of the combined CB and CDA payment for a four-child family to today where child benefit now accounts for almost 70%.  In other words, a family now loses only 30% of its child income support through loss of child dependant allowances when a welfare recipient moves into full-time employment.In this budget I am increasing child benefit rates by €10 per month.  This increase will apply to all children, benefiting over 560,000 families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children, and will be effective from April 2007.  While child benefit remains the main support for families with children, I recognise that the labour market has changed greatly since 1994 and that other supports to low income families have also been brought to bear.  The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000, allied with the refocusing of family income supplement last January, has served to further reduce the impact of the loss of CDAs in the decision to take up full-time employment.  Also, the introduction of the national employment action plan in 1998 has greatly assisted unemployed persons in making the transition to work and education.In this context, I now propose to simplify the present system by standardising for all children on the highest of the current three CDA rates a new single child dependant allowance of €22 per week that will now apply to all social welfare schemes.  For those on the current lower rates of €16.80 and €19.30 per week, this represents a substantial improvement.These are not the only measures being taken to address the position of children in low income households.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance provides additional income support for the poorest families and is highly targeted.  With this in mind, I am increasing the allowance by €60 for children aged between 2 and 11 and by €95 for children aged between 12 and 22, bringing the rates of payment to €180 and €285 respectively.  As a result of the past two budgets, this allowance has nearly doubled in value.  My Department will advertise the scheme widely in a publicity campaign to begin in July 2007 so as to maximise take-up.Family income supplement, or FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and provides an incentive to enter or remain in employment.  I am pleased with the impact of this year's FIS improvements and the response to the awareness campaign undertaken by my Department which resulted in an increase of more than 20% to 21,400 families receiving FIS.  As research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families, last year's budget refocused the FIS weekly earnings thresholds in favour of such families.  I have followed this approach again this year.  Consequently, average payments per child will increase to nearly €50.  It is also anticipated that the changes in the thresholds will entitle approximately 5,600 additional families to the payment.Before I leave the subject of child income support and child poverty, I will comment briefly on the one parent family payment.  Last March I launched the Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, which put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of child care, improved information services for lone parents, the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children and the co-habitation rule.One of the proposals in the report was that the upper limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week.  In budget 2006, I increased the upper income limits on the one parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week, moving a substantial way towards this limit, and this year I am completing this element of the proposal by increasing the upper income limit for the one parent family payment to €400 per week.The new social assistance payment, currently being developed by officials in my Department, will have the long-term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment, because employment offers the best route out of poverty.  Once I am convinced that all of the issues have been fully worked out I propose to bring legislation to the Dáil.I fully realise that the proposed new payment cannot be introduced without co-ordinated supports and services being put in place by other Departments and agencies.  Accordingly, the Government has instructed the senior officials group on social inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce the new payment scheme to replace the lone parent allowance.I have outlined in some detail the principal elements of my budget package but a range of other measures are also being taken, which are listed in the budget fact sheet published yesterday.  I am taking a number of steps to further encourage social welfare recipients to take up employment, education or training.  There are improvements in the back to work allowance, the back to education allowance and rent and mortgage interest supplements.The means test for rent and mortgage interest supplement is being reformed so that recipients retain at least half of any extra income they get from employment, education or training allowances, subject to a limit of €200 in extra income.  This means that they may be better off by up to €100 per week by availing of such opportunities.  These arrangements will also apply to people on rent supplement who take up full-time employment while they are awaiting transfer to the rental accommodation scheme run by the local authorities.I have also been able to achieve one of the principal commitments in my Department's disability sectoral plan.  People in residential care prior to August 1999, or those who entered residential care subsequent to that date without an entitlement to disability allowance, are disqualified from receipt of the allowance solely because of their residency.  This situation was partially addressed in budget 2005 when I introduced a new disability allowance, a personal expense rate currently payable at €35 per week, to 2,700 people in residential care who qualified for this payment.  This payment replaced the pocket money spending allowances that had previously been paid to some of these residents by the Health Service Executive but at a standardised and higher rate.  I am pleased to announce that I am now making these people eligible for full disability allowance as a matter of right, subject only to the same conditions as apply to others.  This will ensure that all persons with disability in residential care have an entitlement to an income maintenance payment and are treated in the same way as other social welfare recipients.As with other social assistance payments, capital held by a client in receipt of disability allowance is assessed with a disregard of the first €20,000.  However, I recognise that persons in receipt of disability allowance may not have had the opportunity to accumulate savings or other income through participation in employment and that disability may, in some cases, hamper a person's ability to live independently.I am also aware that in such circumstances families may wish to make future financial provision for a child or sibling but are concerned that such provision might adversely affect their entitlement to disability allowance.  Similarly, in cases where a compensation award has been made to a client as a result of accident or injury, he or she may be concerned about a reduction or loss of payment of disability allowance and secondary benefits.  I am therefore introducing a higher threshold of €50,000 as the capital disregard specifically for the disability allowance scheme.  This means a client with disability may hold this amount of capital, or provision can be made for the client up to this amount, and still retain full payment of disability allowance.  This measure is designed to address, to some extent, the issue of future financial provision for some of our most vulnerable citizens, particularly by parents or other family members.  Approximately 500 people are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of disability allowance who will benefit from the proposed increase in the disregard level immediately.As Deputies will be aware, the Citizens Information Bill 2006, which is currently being debated by the House, lays the statutory foundation for the provision of a personal advocacy service to people with disabilities.  I am providing for a further €1.9 million to Comhairle, soon to be known as the citizens information board, assuming the legislation is accepted, to continue the development of this and related services next year.As our welfare system matures, considerable efforts will be made to ensure our social insurance system is inclusive and that it remains relevant to the lives and needs of workers.  More than 2.8 million people are now insured, an increase of 1 million over the past ten years.  While social insurance contribution rates have fallen over the past decade, the benefits paid on foot of these contributions have risen.  Social insurance payments now account for almost half of all social welfare payments.  Over the next decade, we must continue to ensure the social insurance system continues to be relevant, flexible and affordable, while also continuing to serve our wider economic circumstances.  In this context, two important reports will be published next year, the Green Paper on pensions policy and the actuarial review of the social insurance fund.  These reports will be critical to mapping the future direction for social insurance and will assist in defining our national policy of sustainable incomes for all.  In the meantime, I am prepared to consider certain necessary measures to ensure the system remains responsive to emerging situations.

I will begin where the last Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, left off three years ago when he was banished to Brussels.  Yesterday, we reached the three year deadline for his promise to decentralise 10,000 civil servants.  When he made his promise, he said the Government would be judged on the delivery of that commitment, and so it will.  The Government subsequently announced that the original timeframe was overly ambitious and it extended the deadline by an extra year.  However, when asked about what has happened to that second deadline, the Government claims that decentralising Departments and offices will have a presence in a total of 29 new locations around the country by the end of 2007.  It is anyone's guess, however, how "presence" is defined.  In my home town of Birr, the presence consists of two FÁS staff, enticingly described as an advance party.  We have been promised that the presence in Birr will be increased in the new year to 20 in an office the responsible Minister hailed as having capacity for 30 people.  The site purchase arrangements are unclear, with the owner having returned FÁS its deposit in order to sell the site to another developer.  We have been told the latter developer will sell the site to FÁS but we do not know whether that is a contractual obligation.  Long after we were promised that the entire headquarters of 400 staff would be moved to Birr, staff numbers have reached 5% of the target.  The Minister for Finance might outline for the House what he means when he claims to have put in place plans for decentralisation.  In the case of State agencies, a more individualised approach has been recommended by the decentralisation implementation group.  What will that approach involve, when will we know more about it and when will it be delivered?  These are legitimate questions that need to be answered.I regret the Government failed to use budget 2007 to overhaul vital psychological services in the education system.  Figures released to me today by the Minister for Education and Science confirm that the number of primary schools lacking access to services provided by the National Educational Psychological Service increased by 160 between February 2005 and December 2006.  These schools have dropped off the NEPS radar because of the failure by this Government to live up to a promise it made almost eight years ago.  When NEPS was established in 1999, a target was set to have 184 psychologists working within the service by 2004, by which time all schools were supposed to be able to access the service.  However, the Government is short of its target by 60 posts and the fact that the number of primary schools covered by the service is declining is an indictment of the Government's failure to keeps its word.  The figures released to me confirm that 51% of primary schools are not covered by the service.  In County Longford, 82% of primary schools remain outside the service, which is the worst record in the country.  In counties Carlow, Donegal and south Tipperary, 74% of primary schools lack cover.  Some 71% of primary schools in County Laois, which I represent, and County Westmeath are not covered by NEPS.  I acknowledge that increases were announced in the Estimates but these will be insufficient to address the scale of the problem, particularly given that the service only received an additional €2,000 last year.  As the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 begins the process of implementation and the multi-disciplinary meetings to which the Act commits are established, the workload of NEPS psychologists is becoming even more demanding in terms of meeting parents and schools.I want to addresses the claims made by the Taoiseach that schools have access to private assessment.  He is correct only in so far as they have access for no more than two children.  Parents will judge that for themselves, as will the school principals who are left to try to decide who most needs the service.  I have spoken to principals who have had little choice but to find the extra money needed to allow access for more children through fundraising, juggling their budgets or even dipping into capitation grants.  Therefore, when the Taoiseach refers to access, we know he means to say "access for two — tough luck to everybody else".  The second assessment these children will need before they leave the primary system must also be met from the limit of two.  That, according to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, is access, so it is no wonder the Taoiseach was shouted down when he made his claims earlier this week.  I presume he deliberately confuses psychologists with psychiatrists, whose services are also under funded.The Government should stop pretending the matter is all right.  It is not all right that a child cannot get an assessment because his or her parents cannot afford it and children who are not assessed cannot get the dedicated services they need.  An additional allocation of €5 million in 2007, along with the amount set aside in the Estimates, would at least provide funding to cover every school by NEPS.  Such funding is needed immediately because access to the service is vital for children and young people with special educational needs.It is a pity the Government did not use the budget to underpin the development of Ireland's knowledge economy by supporting mathematics, science and information technology in the education system.  This Government constantly refers to the amount of money being spent by each Department and in each area but never mentions the outcome.  The continued growth of the economy must be enabled.  The Government of 2006 must plan for our needs in 2016 and beyond.  There is universal agreement in this House that Ireland must move in the direction of developing a knowledge economy.  We must recognise that scientific and mathematical understanding will play a significant role, as will developments in information technology.  I am concerned that the Government consistently undervalues the role of post-primary education in setting the foundations for these subjects.  As matters stand, 14% of junior certificate students do not take science.  This year, 12% of students failed ordinary level mathematics.  More than a third of our secondary schools fail to offer all science subjects to leaving certificate level and 5,500 school computers are beyond repair, not to mention the substandard science facilities provided in many schools.The seeds of scientific development are sown at an early age, so the Minister for Finance should have made a clear policy decision to underpin science mathematics and information technology at secondary level by focusing budget resources on these subjects from 2007.  He should have begun by auditing and completely overhauling the science infrastructure in all schools and allowing for the recruitment of laboratory technicians on a cluster basis.  He should have ensured that the full complement of science subjects is offered at leaving certificate level in all schools and that science is made a core subject at junior certificate level.  He should radically improve the information technology equipment in schools and establish an agenda whereby all secondary schools and teachers have access to laptop computers.  He should instigate a process of reform of curricular content and development and teacher training, a need which is borne out in reports in today's newspapers that leaving certificate examiners have noted a decline in standards among those taking ordinary level science papers.  One of the problems identified by examiners was poor mathematical abilities in pupils who took the combined physics and chemistry paper in 2005, with weaker students unable to complete the required number of questions.  The ordinary level standard was lower than in previous levels and there was a strong tendency among candidates at both levels to avoid questions on specific areas, such as electricity and organic chemistry.  According to the reports, the examiners stressed the need to improve basic mathematical skills and the understanding of basic chemistry and physics.  However, such improvements will not occur by accident.Yesterday's budget effectively ignored education.  I welcome the increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, which was badly needed.  Every year, I am approached by families who simply cannot afford to kit out their children for school.  The thresholds for these allowances need to be investigated because many families in genuine need are refused, advised to apply for exceptional needs payments, which they are also frequently refused, or given amounts so paltry as to make them irrelevant.Some 30% of children from disadvantaged backgrounds have serious literacy problems and almost one in five young people leave school without a qualification.  An unacceptable number of buildings are substandard, with exceptionally poor science labs, computer facilities and sports infrastructure.  Absenteeism is rife, with 7,000 children missing more than 20 days per year, which is equivalent to a full year of school during the primary cycle.  Some 111,000 primary school children are in classes of 30 pupils or more despite promises to the contrary.This is not just a matter of spending money.  Budget 2007 should have set out priorities in education for the coming year and funded them accordingly, such as improving literacy, keeping children in school and equipping young people with the knowledge and skills they will need as adults.  Instead, education is overlooked, showing where the real priorities lie.It was interesting to hear the Government recommit to Transport 21, which is behind schedule in its first year.  Transport 21 ignores some of the most important roads, including in my constituency, which I share with the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  At a committee meeting last month, I raised the issue of the conditions of the N52, N62, N80, the Laois orbital route and the Tullamore bypass with the National Roads Authority.  The development of those routes is vital to the opening up of counties Offaly and Laois to investment and new and better opportunities.  The NRA stated clearly that it must work within the remit of Government policy, which effectively begins and ends with Transport 21.The CEO of the NRA stated: "Given that we have been set certain objectives which we will achieve, there is a limit to the funds available to pursue other projects at the same time."  Regardless of the position of Athlone-Mullingar-Tullamore as a regional gateway town in the national spatial strategy or of Portlaoise's designation as an inland port, we must wait.  We do not know for how long we must wait, but the date will be after 2010 at the earliest due to Government policy.  The CEO also stated: "If more money is made available, we will gladly take it and do more".I cannot stress enough how important the upgrading and improvement of those major secondary routes are to the development of the midlands as a whole and not just my constituency.  The N52, N62 and N80 are the main links to the N6, N7 and N8 national primaries.  The major towns on those routes are being hampered by the lack of progress.  Likewise, the lack of progress in respect of the Tullamore bypass and the Portlaoise orbital route are affecting the development of towns.I wish to impress on the Government the need to develop our rail infrastructure, which is part of Transport 21.  All stations in my constituency need more car parking facilities.  While some are receiving necessary improvements, others such as Tullamore are not.  It is beyond belief that several train stations do not provide proper disability access for customers of Iarnród Éireann.  How much is it to ask to support the basic right to use a train service with dignity and ease?  When one of the Ministers present or the Minister of State is next in my constituency, I ask them to watch how someone in a wheelchair must get on and off a train.  The situation is disgraceful and disgusting in this day and age.I remain disappointed by the Government's attitude towards farmers whose lands have been compulsorily acquired by the NRA for the building of our national road network.  No farmer wants to see the NRA call to his or her door because it wants his or her farm and, sometimes, home.  While the improvement and upgrading of roads is part of life, the abolition of roll-over relief in the first budget after the last general election was a considerable blow to many farmers.The reality of life under the CPO system is that one is deprived of the use of one's land and of one's livelihood, but one does not receive compensation for a considerable period thereafter.  One is compensated at the value of the land when notice to treat is served, not when the money is received, which is several years later in a number of cases, and one pays capital gains tax of 20%.  If one is lucky enough to find replacement land, one has lost 20% of the amount one can spend and must pay stamp duty of up to 9% on the new piece of land.  Consequently, one cannot buy a parcel of land of the same size without losing 29% of the compensation.  It is a financial impossibility.It is a pity that a farmer cannot set himself or herself up as a company like National Toll Roads and treat his or her payment as profits, thus avoiding capital gains tax or being able to opt for the lesser corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Allowing farmers to avail of farm consolidation, which was improved somewhat by the budget, would have been a good start.The Government has failed to understand the problem of child care and seems to believe that last year's token gesture was sufficient, but it was and is not.  Increasing the income disregard might encourage a few more people to care for children in the home, which I hope will be the case, but that is all it will do.  Increasing maternity leave by four weeks will be welcomed by some, but many women cannot afford to take the full entitlement.  Their mortgages and other costs are so high that they cannot meet them if they stay out on maternity leave.  For many women in that position, the extra four weeks, although sounding lovely, will be of no use.The increase of €2.50 per week in the child benefit payment can only be described as paltry and does not recognise rising costs across the board.  Hard-pressed families will remain so.  It is difficult to believe that the Government ignored the under 18-year-olds who, despite being children, care for their parents.  It would be difficult to find a more vulnerable group and children deprived of real childhoods due to family illnesses need special attention.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated that he is committed to an even stronger and more focused campaign in an all-out commitment to end child poverty in 21st century Ireland.  Effectively, he is committed to a commitment.  It is a pity that he did not press himself to name a year in the 21st century because there are 93 years to go.  After listening to a representative of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul last night, I worry about how long we must wait.The Government missed an opportunity to do something imaginative in respect of stamp duty.  The Tánaiste, who is present, has not spoken about much else in recent months.  Perhaps he did not want to be denied the opportunity of running a single-issue campaign in the next general election.  The Government has had ten budgets in office, but if it has not done something to date, no one will believe that it will do it next time, which is hopefully a long time away.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I thank my colleague for sharing her time with me.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance's announcement on the budget received much fanfare in the Chamber.  While matters are good for the majority of people, they could be much better for everyone if we managed our economy better and ensured that money collected via hard-earned taxes was properly spent rather than wasted, which is occurring left, right and centre in every Department and State agency.Like all Deputies who are going hither and thither around the country, I have travelled a considerable amount in recent weeks, but it is often frustrating to see local authorities resurfacing roads while it is raining.  They would be better off not spending the money rather than wasting it in that way.  However, if they do not spend it now, they will be denied money next year, which is typical of the mismanagement of taxes.It is disappointing that the budget is not family-friendly.  There was a significant opportunity to provide supports to young families who are under considerable financial pressure in terms of mortgages and child cares costs, but an increase of €2.30 will not address those costs.  The challenge is not one of spending money, which the Government is well able to do, but of how to spend wisely, a concept the Government cannot understand.  It could have abolished stamp duty, which the Tánaiste advocated in respect of first-time buyers, but it did not.  This is another empty promise.  It is disappointing that stay-at-home parents were again ignored by the Minister for Finance in the budget.Regarding the agricultural sector and yesterday's announcements on income tax, a farmer or another self-employed person on an income of €30,000 per annum and with two children will benefit to the tune of €18 per week.  However, when one takes the rate of inflation of 3.9% into account, which equates to a cost of €22.50, that person will lose €4.50 per week.The Minister increased the PAYE tax credit by €440 to €3,520, increasing the gap between the self-employed and PAYE workers.  This is an additional tax of €68 per week on the take home pay of the self-employed.  This is blatant discrimination.  Many self-employed people are under huge financial pressure because of the 45 stealth taxes introduced or increased by the Government in the past five years.  It is wrong that they are not given the recognition they deserve.Home carers and farm families were ignored in the budget.  Not one additional cent has been given to them.  The tax credit of €770 has not been increased, nor was it increased last year.  The budget gives no recognition to the mother who stays at home to take care of her children or to those who care for the elderly in their own homes.  The tax system ignores these people.  We do not recognise women who work in the home or on farms, mainly in rural Ireland.  Many of these women work in partnership with their husbands, in some cases owning land, but because of the tax and PRSI system they are paid by their husbands and no recognition is given to them in the social welfare system.  This is wrong and needs to be examined.  It is disappointing the budget grants no recognition to these people, mostly women.I welcome the announcement regarding energy crops and bio-fuels, which Fine Gael called for in our policy document published earlier this year.  I welcome the increase of €80 per hectare under the energy crop scheme.  However, there is no point encouraging farmers to grow renewable energy or bio-fuel crops when there is no market for them.  This illustrates the lack of joined up thinking in the Government.  No incentive is given for the production of blended bio-fuels.  There are no plans to legislate to ensure blended bio-fuels replace petrol and diesel, no proposals for the extension of the removal of excise duty on bio-fuels, no plans to open a public competition for capital start-up grants for bio-fuel processing plants, no plans to require public transport and other public service vehicles to convert where feasible to bio-fuels and no proposal to make a major capital allocation to bio-fuels instead of wasting money buying carbon credits.  There is an appalling lack of joined up thinking.  This is why the Minister said yesterday that by 2009 there will be an uptake of only €6 million on grants in this area.  There will not be an uptake if there is no market.The Government has focused on bio-fuels because our sugar industry was wiped out last year.  This was not mentioned in the Minster's speech yesterday.  Farmers who will receive their compensation payments next June will be liable for the full rate of tax on those payments.  Greencore workers are arguing that they are not being paid the correct rate of redundancy but they will not be treated as badly as farmers, who are also to be given a redundancy package.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food promised that farmers would be treated in a sympathetic manner but no recognition has been given to them in the budget.  The Government closed the sugar industry, made a half-hearted proposal to put some other sector in its place and made sure farmers will receive a reduced redundancy package because the Minister for Agriculture and Food decided to give the lion's share of the compensation to Greencore.  Furthermore, the vast majority of the reduced compensation package will come back to the State in tax because no provision has been made to reduce the rate of tax to be paid on it.In recent years we have heard much about the need for farm consolidation.  The Government continually calls for greater efficiency in farming and business.  Farm consolidation would lead to much greater efficiency.  Approximately one third of Irish farms are in four or more parcels of land.  Farming organisations have made submission after submission for a scheme to facilitate the purchase, sale or transfer of land in order to consolidate farms and improve efficiency.  The sale of land carries a tax of 20%, the purchase of land carries a tax of 9% and there are other associated costs.  The change announced yesterday regarding land swaps will help a handful of farmers but does not address the principal issue of farm fragmentation.The Government has, in fact, introduced a tax on farm fragmentation with the introduction of water metering, mainly in the west.  Farmers will have to pay for individual water meters on every parcel of land.  One farmer told a public meeting on Monday last that he has 13 separate parcels of land on his 40 acre farm.  He will be charged €80 for each meter even before water goes through it.  He will also have to pay one fifth more for water to pay for leakage in the public water main on the public road.  The Minister for Finance provided €10 million for water metering.  Will this deal with the cost of putting the infrastructure in place?  We do not know.Deputy Enright raised the issue of the compulsory purchase of land.  It is morally wrong to force farmers to sell land and tax the sale at 30%.  Until four years ago farmers could avail of relief if they re-invested the payment for land compulsorily purchased in replacing the land.  That relief was removed by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, and his Minister of State, Deputy Parlon.  Farmers who are forced to sell their land are taxed at the rate of 30% on the price of the land sold.  The legislation covering compulsory purchase states that no one who compulsorily sells land should be worse off at the end of the process than he or she was beforehand.  That is not the current position and I am sure someone will challenge it in the courts.  It is not morally right.Even before his appointment as Minister of State, Deputy Parlon spoke of the need to address the problem of flooding in the Shannon basin.  He has produced a report on this, which has been presented for consultation, and there have been round table talks.  However, nothing practical has been done to address the issue of flooding in the Shannon basin, especially south of Athlone.  Homes are threatened with flooding, communities are isolated but not one cent of funding has been provided to carry out maintenance on the River Shannon or to raise roads to maintain access to those homes.  An elderly man suffered a heart attack some years ago.  The only way he could be brought to the hospital was on two bales of straw tied to a buckrake on the back of a tractor.  It is unacceptable in an economy such as this that any human being should have to be transferred in such a manner.  The Minister has produced lovely maps showing that certain areas are prone to flooding.  However, little has been done to alleviate the problem at local level.The nitrates directive has been smothered under layers of bureaucracy.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, her Department and Teagasc have all contradicted each other on the interpretation of the rules and regulations.  How can we expect farmers to implement the nitrates directive when the three agents of the State cannot agree on definitions?During the Estimates process we discovered that the Minister for Health and Children handed back €300 million in unspent moneys to the Minister for Finance.  On a per capita basis, that €300 million could have provided 4,300 additional medical cards for families in Roscommon-South Leitrim.  It could have provided my constituents with 400 additional inpatient operations in local hospitals.  It could have provided 76,000 additional hours of home help in every parish throughout the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim.  Some 400 children who have been waiting years for orthodontic procedures could have received treatment; it could also have addressed the problem of school bullying and children’s self-esteem issues.  Instead, the Minister for Health and Children returned that money unspent to the Department of Finance.All this highlights that this is not a family-friendly budget.  While money is flowing into the coffers, the Government does not know how to spend it in a manner that delivers for the public.  Money can be put in place by Government to employ additional administrators and we have seen what has happened with the Health Service Executive.   However, when it comes to delivery on the ground, whether it is for psychological services, overcrowding in schools, or on health services, the Government cannot deliver.

I recall the occasion vividly as it was the first year I was elected to this House.  In what was effectively my first contribution, it fell to me to reply to that speech.  Then an Opposition Member, I remember being in the odd position of having to agree that what he was saying about the national finances was fundamentally correct.  He said the time had come for Ministers for Finance to say "no" and make the requisite changes in how Ireland was being run.I reflected on that speech and the different circumstances which now obtain in modern Ireland.  I wondered how many people listening to that radio broadcast thought it sounded like something from the 1940s or 1950s.  We are grateful that our young people have never seen a recession or slump.  That generation did not see the circumstances that forced the State to embark on a new course which brought us to yesterday's budget.The transformation has been far-reaching and total.  In the 1980s the country suffered from mass unemployment, mass emigration, colossal taxation, little enterprise, and State domination of virtually every industry of note; there were State-run insurance companies, banks, shipping lines, energy and telecommunications companies.  We have come to a different position now.In overall terms, the dominant political outlook in Ireland has changed to one liberating the talents and innate capacity of the people to deliver.  For the first time since the State was established, we have reached a point where the talents and capacities of the people can be freely expressed.  The people are free to achieve what the men and women who founded the State could only have dreamed of.  They would have dreamed that the State could be successful and thrive economically, that it could provide an example to other states and be populated by people with a sense of self-confidence, an abhorrence of failure and an impatience to do better.All this has come to pass for a variety of reasons, starting with Ray MacSharry's speech.  He said that the previous Administration's incapacity to deal with the fundamental macro-economic problem had to come to an end that afternoon.  We began to examine the major obstacles that stood in the way of unleashing the people's potential.  One of those was the question of how we taxed enterprise and work.  Until then, it was done in such a way that it effectively drove work out of the economy and drove risk-taking underground.  It drove the brightest and best youngsters out of our society.It is difficult for some people to now realise that the first taxable pound of earnings was then taxed at 35% plus 7.5% PRSI.  That meant that 42.5p was taken from the most modest pound paid to the least well off workers.  By the time a single worker earned the average industrial wage, he or she was paying 50%-60% of their marginal earnings to the Exchequer.  These are figures which some people have ceased to remember.  However, those are the circumstances which Ray MacSharry was dealing with in 1987.Even though the battle is long over, the ideological argument that tax rates and the structure of our tax system does not matter still lingers.  Whether one takes a small fraction or a large fraction of a worker's earnings certainly matters.  When Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came to power in 1997, a single worker on the average industrial wage paid 27% of earnings in taxes and social insurance.  That has now been reduced to less than 15%.  It was interesting to look at the graphs in the budget booklet.  They demonstrated that while the tax burden has gone down since 1997, the number of people working here has increased hugely.  Charlie McCreevy's famous decision to cut capital gains tax from 40% to 20% was described, by someone no longer a Member of this House, as a fiscal obscenity.  However, the decision increased the number of taxable capital gains transactions so much that the Exchequer earned more than five times as much tax at the 20% rate that it had at the 40% rate.Tax rates are important because they determine people's attitude to further work, such as whether it is worthwhile doing overtime, seeking promotion, making an investment or taking a risk.  These things are determined as much by rates as by the overall tax burden.  This is why it is important we never lose track of what has succeeded for Ireland.  It is why we should never give up on the fundamentals — the sound economics Ray MacSharry stood for and a pro-enterprise and pro-work system of taxation.It was a remarkable state of affairs yesterday that when Deputy Cowen stood up, he had a budget surplus of 1.2%.  It represented a great achievement in a relatively short period.  In the same budget, the Minister provided for growth of 11.5% in current expenditure and 13% in capital expenditure, while 5% of our gross national product is each year committed to infrastructural projects.While all the above took place, the House was also presented with what Fr. Seán Healy welcomed on radio today as an historic breakthrough.  That breakthrough is a welfare package which means that the fruits of the prosperity, sound economics and good government have brought to Ireland will be provided, as the Constitution requires, to those who need it most.  While Members sometimes fail to look up the rule book, Article 45 of the Constitution sets out the duty of the State to look after those who are less well off.  While it is a matter for the Oireachtas rather than the courts to ensure, the duty of the State is to ensure that private enterprise is favoured but does not abuse its position and that every man and woman has the right to a livelihood to sustain a decent standard of life.  The Constitution is clear which is why I am strongly of the view that pro-employment social, taxation and economic policies are the keys to a prosperous and decent society.  There is no unleashing of the potential of individuals if they are denied access to employment and a meaningful role in the economic life of the State.There are many things we must do now.  The mere fact that we have arrived at the current stage of economic success where a significant surplus can be run, social welfare package put before the House and tax reform put in place, does not mean we can rest on our laurels and suggest we will plateau on the broad, sunlit uplands of economic success where nothing further needs to be done.  We live in a competitive, globalised economy in which there is a great deal for Ireland to do.  Ireland must make up its significant infrastructural deficit.  Over decades of economic failure, we fell behind many member states of the European Union in our transport infrastructure, broadband, etc.  Now is the time for us to catch up.As has been pointed out by commentators, now is the time to ensure the record levels of resources available to the State are employed on a value-for-money basis for a decent return.  Achieving this goal will require a different approach to administration.  We must improve the ways we manage and control expenditure to ensure that projects come in on time.  While it has become a byword to say that everything is too late and expensive, we must remember that of the last 20 major transport infrastructural projects, 19 came in on time and within budget.  During the week we saw that west of Kinnegad a significant motorway will open well ahead of schedule and within budget.  If we get our act together in managing our expenditure, we can achieve many things.The Government committed in 2002 to a number of targets, one of which was to ensure that the minimum wage, which was established in the lifetime of the previous Government, would be completely free from taxation.  As a result of yesterday's budget, almost 38% of Irish earners have been removed from the tax net altogether.  The Government also said it would ensure that 80% of people paying tax would pay at the standard rate while only 20% would pay at the top rate.  While there has been controversy about the matter, I do not wish to get involved in a highly theoretical argument.  I listened to George Lee on the radio today and understood that it is being said that we have not achieved our target and should give up saying we have because of the difference in approach between tax allowances and tax credits.  If someone is liable for tax at the higher rate but the liability is extinguished by a tax credit, he or she is not paying tax at the higher rate.  If we had stayed with the system of allowances, which was unfair, the fact would be abundantly clear.  However, because the tax credit system operates on a slightly different mathematical formula, it is contended that someone who would, but for his or her tax credits, pay at the higher rate is a higher-rate taxpayer.  I do not accept that for one minute.To determine who is liable for tax at the higher rate, one must take into account tax credits to the same extent as one takes into account tax allowances.  The Government's commitment, therefore, has been delivered in full.  Some of my colleagues have referred to an "effective rate of tax".  The danger of such references is that people take it to mean an "average rate of tax" which is not what is at issue in this context.  At issue is whether people are liable for a higher rate of tax on the basis of tax credits when they would not be so liable under the equivalent system of tax allowances.  The Government has delivered in that area.We agreed at the outset of the Government's term of office that if economic circumstances permitted, we would reduce the 42% income tax rate to 40%.  As the Minister, Deputy Cowen, indicated yesterday, we intend to make half the reduction in the current budget and to complete the process in the next if we are favoured with re-election by the Irish people.  While it would have been possible, given the surplus at Deputy Cowen's disposal, to make the full reduction in one year, it would not have been prudent.  Given the substantial tax reliefs granted by the widening of the bands, the removal of minimum wage earners from the tax system and the social welfare packages put in place, a full reduction of the higher rate could well have endangered the stability of the economy and ignited inflation.  It is prudent and reasonable to implement the measure in two stages.  I make no bones about my gladness that it is being done that way.When the dust settles at the end of the budget debate, the real issues will be whether Ireland's prosperity has been guaranteed and the State has put in place a system of taxes, welfare and support which makes Ireland a fairer, more decent, hardworking and successful society.  Having listened to reaction from outside rather than within the House, where I expect adversarial responses, it is clear that yesterday's budget was, by any standard, a spectacular success.  I pay tribute to Deputy Cowen for the amazing achievements over which he has presided as Minister for Finance.  I acknowledge his prudence, concern for the less well off and capacity to deliver and sustain a positive future for the younger generation of Irish people.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Like Deputy McDowell, I was first elected to the House in 1987, for which reason alone that year's election sticks in my mind.  It sticks in my mind for other reasons too.  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, clearly described the economic situation in the country, with economic parameters based on inflation and employment levels etc.  During the 1987 election campaign no house in the constituency we called to was without an unemployed person or a member of the household who had emigrated, or a combination of both.  Within 12 months of being elected, I had a four-drawer filing cabinet full of CVs from people seeking employment.  Some 40,000 to 50,000 left our shores every year because of the economic situation.I believe I made my maiden speech during the budget debate.  I had come across a letter in the sadly now defunct and out of circulation The Irish Press written from Boston by a young man from Kilkenny.  The letter he wrote castigated politicians of all parties for the fact he was in Boston where he did not want to be.  He wanted to be working at home and to bring up a family here.  However, he could not do so because, he said, of the failure of successive generations of Irish politicians.  I said that day in the House that I hoped that as long as I was in politics I would never need to see a letter written by an Irish person living abroad castigating politicians.  As a new Deputy, I pledged myself to try to ensure I would make decisions that I felt were in the best interests of the country rather than based on political expediency.In a sense in the past 20 years that is what successive Governments have done, mainly involving Fianna Fáil, but also other parties.  I have given credit to the two Governments between 1987 and 1992, the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government from 1989 to 1992 and the Fianna Fáil Government from 1987 to 1989.  I also gave credit to former Deputy Alan Dukes who was Leader of the Opposition at the time and instituted the Tallaght strategy which helped the then Government to make decisions that might not have been made previously.  In many respects this is a very happy day for Members on all sides of the House, although they might not admit it.  We are debating how we should spend the huge sums of money generated by the people's work and facilitated by successful Government policies.As the Minister with responsibility for communications, the marine and natural resources, I wish to focus on the energy element of my brief as it pertains to the budget.  The budget has confirmed and demonstrated the Government's commitment to a clean, clever and competitive energy sector.  It clearly demonstrates our support for the concept that better energy efficiency and demand management initiatives pay significant dividends for citizens.  The allocation of an additional €20 million under the greener homes domestic grants scheme almost doubles the funding provided last year for the programme.  Funding of €47 million is now available for greener homes.  This represents a clear recognition by the Government of the enthusiasm with which the public has embraced the programme.  Since March almost 10,000 applications have been received for grant aid toward the purchase of wood pellet boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps.  The level of interest in the scheme has been very encouraging and a strong endorsement of the Government's policy to increase the deployment of renewable energy sources across all sectors of the economy.Building on this policy and to ensure every individual, group or business can access cheaper and cleaner energy, we are also extending the €22 million bio-heat programme which I launched last June.  Our focus so far has been on wood pellet and wood chip heating systems for the commercial sector.  An additional €4 million will now be provided for the programme in the period to 2008, allowing us to widen its scope and increase the choice and flexibility in the technologies best suited to people's needs.  Critically, we will now include the non-commercial sector in the grants programme.Clearly, those who play an active and positive role in shaping the society in which we live must be encouraged and rewarded for their efforts.  In particular, those who do so on a voluntary basis need to be recognised.  Following the budget, the community, sports and voluntary sector which makes a very significant contribution to all of our lives will now be able to avail of the scheme.  These initiatives, including bio-heat, biofuel, the greener homes grant scheme, etc. are helping to reduce our dependence on conventional fossil fuels, lowering CO2 emissions and will assist business, householders and community and voluntary groups in accessing cheaper and cleaner fuels.  The new measures build on last year's budget package of €65 million over five years for renewable energy initiatives by providing an additional €24 million in funding.The Minister for Finance also announced his intention to continue the corporation tax incentive for investment in renewable energy projects for a further five years, subject to EU approval.  This practical and successful scheme provides tax relief for corporate investment in renewable energy products in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories and will be very important in the future.  By extending the length and capacity of existing schemes, including new technologies and increasing access to funding, we will reap many benefits by reducing CO2 emissions; cutting energy costs; contributing to security of energy supply by diversifying the energy technologies and sources; and contributing to the development of a vibrant renewable energy sector.  These measures are engaging all members of society in the debate on a cleaner greener society.We are broadening the scope of and changing people's attitudes and behaviour, an example of which is the recently launched Power of One campaign which aims to encourage a reduction in energy demand.  The budget further emphasised the importance of energy efficiency, with an additional €3 million provided for Sustainable Energy Ireland to develop pilot programmes to support small and medium enterprises.  These will allow for the introduction of energy audits in the sector.  They will assess SME energy usage and measures to enhance energy efficiency.  The impact of the pilot scheme will be reviewed during 2007.  It will assist SME energy usage and increase energy efficiency in the sector generally.Despite the criticism from some Members across the floor, the budget introduces a number of measures to support the agriculture sector in growing and harvesting energy crops.  It is critical that all elements of the supply chain are in place if we are to develop a robust renewable energy market that meets the needs of consumers and industry and supports the rural economy.  This is another piece in the jigsaw of developing renewable energy initiatives.The ministerial task force on bio-energy comprises seven Ministers from key Departments involved in the development of renewable energy resources.  As part of the work of the task force, I intend to publish a national biomass action plan shortly.  Some of the measures in the budget which I welcome anticipate that plan.The announcements in respect of vehicle registration and motor tax will help to deliver further projects in the bio-fuels area.  Deputy Naughten referred to a range of items not announced yesterday in the Budget Statement.  It is clear the Deputy has been reading my Department's Green Paper because all of the matters he raised, about which he wanted the Minister for Finance to speak in connection with the budget, are covered therein.  They will be finalised in the White Paper we intend to publish early in the new year.The Government's energy policy is designed to ensure Ireland can develop sustainable sources of energy, increase its energy efficiency and improve the security of its energy supply.  An area of importance in the context of energy is that of research and development, on which the Government is focused.The budget reflects what the Government has done during the past nine years.  Yesterday, we again underlined our commitment to an inclusive society.  The record social welfare package of €1.4 billion is a demonstration of our commitment to the less well-off in society.  The Government had committed to increase the old age pension to at least €200 per week and in the budget we have more than delivered on that commitment.  We are doing this by increasing the non-contributory pension by €18 to €200 per week.  In addition, those in receipt of contributory old age pensions will receive €209 per week.The Government is listening and taking on board what it hears.  The budget is not just about building for the future through responsible fiscal policies and ambitious investment programmes which are important, it also revolves around dealing with the needs of the individual and those issues people face on a daily basis.  We have set about addressing these issues in four main ways: first, as the Tánaiste stated, we have completed a transition to a more equitable tax and welfare system; second, the budget maintains and deepens our strategy to reward work and enterprise; third, it provides real support for families with particular needs at critical stages of the life cycle to improve the lives of all the people; and, fourth, it provides incentives to deepen our competitiveness on a sustainable basis.The Government's achievements during the past five years and the partnership's achievements during the past ten have set a sound basis for the future.  I am confident that the direction set out in the budget will provide a cohesive basis on which to positively shape the future of the country.

When one considers that it is a pre-election budget, one would expect it would contain some benefits for the people.  However, today's newspaper headlines should have stated the past three budgets represented a deliberate fraud visited upon the people.  In 2004 the budget surplus was €2.1 billion, in 2005 it was €2.4 billion and this year it is close to €4 billion.  This means that a total of €7 billion has been taken from hardworking taxpayers by the Government during the past three years.  This money will be used for nothing more than buying next year's general election.Government representatives will try to explain this fraud by referring to nonsense such as the level of growth exceeding expectations, the buoyant economy and projected returns being greater than expected.  However, one hard fact remains.

In the 1997 budget Deputy Quinn, Minister for Finance in the then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, returned €800 million to taxpayers.  That was the first occasion in the history of the State on which a Government paid back so much to taxpayers.  In March 1997, three months before Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came to power, like today, the headlines in the national newspapers referred to growth in the economy, spiralling house prices and the Central Bank's concern that growth was driving inflation upwards.  If Deputy Quinn could pay back €800 million in 1997, based on the information in his possession on the economy which was growing at the time, what is the Government's purpose in taxing the people by in excess of €7 billion in the past three years?  The budget is a fraud and represents nothing more than an exercise to buy the next general election.We can make allowances for the fact that calculations in respect of a budget might be out by €100 million or €200 million.  However, the past three budgets have been out by €2 billion.  That represents either incompetence or a scam.  I do not understand how the Government's calculations could have been so consistently wrong during the past three years.

The economist Dan McLaughlin has stated that those between the ages of 30 and 40 years are most in debt.  They comprise the Celtic tiger generation.  For all the pious and patronising remarks made about the people of that generation, it is remarkable that the Government does not see fit to appoint one of its members as part of its Administration.  Believe it or not, there are four people on the Fine Gael Front Bench who are under the age of 40 years.I wish to describe the kind of lives being created by the Government for members of the hardworking, Celtic tiger generation.  Never before have young families been so deeply in debt.  That is a matter to which the Government must give consideration.  Never before have young workers been obliged to commute for ridiculous lengths of time on a daily basis to travel to and from work.  This is an issue with which the Government has failed to deal.

We all contributed to the improvements that have come about in that regard.Never before have parents had so little time to spend with their children and the Government has done little to remedy the situation.  Never before have they been obliged to endure long waiting times in hospitals with their sick children and the Government has failed to act.  Never before have they been obliged to suffer thugs and drunks in our overstretched accident and emergency departments when they take their sick children to hospital at weekends.  Again, the Government has failed to do anything to remedy the situation.

It has continually preached about the booming economy but failed to deal with the obstacles it has placed in the way of members of the Celtic tiger generation.  Many people of my age and younger feel like hamsters on a treadmill, constantly running but getting nowhere.  An even worse crisis threatens, since they are very heavily in debt, a problem about which the Government has done nothing.  Economists tell us how heavily indebted we are, but the Government should address the fact that we are the worst nation in the world in that regard.  In 2000, for every €100 of income earned in this country, we owed €60.  In 2007, for every €100 earned, we will owe €140, and the total is growing.

The Minister can dismiss it, since he is quite comfortable with his wage and pension.  Many people worry about their personal debt, however.  The problem should also be of concern to the Government if it wishes to remain in power after the next general election.  The Celtic tiger generation has been borrowing between €15 billion and €20 billion each year for the last four years.  The Government should recognise that its value is the same as the growth in the economy over that period.  Personal borrowing by the Celtic tiger generation accounts for that growth.  We have gone from being €60 in debt for every €100 of income earned to being in excess of €140 in debt for every €100 of income earned.What will happen when we can borrow no more?  Will growth in the economy hit a brick wall?  If my interpretation is correct, is the worst yet to come?  Has the Government allowed for that, and does it even understand me?  Perhaps the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, should return to the Chamber, or at least send a Minister who understands me, so that I might explain my concerns.  The Irish people might then not borrow so much, and the Minister might correct the economy on their behalf.There has been another year of personal borrowing encouraged to some degree both by Government actions and by factors outside its control.

It was cheap access to money that allowed people to buy such houses, but now house prices have levelled, and interest rates are rising.  It might not affect the Minister of State if he has plenty to spend.  However, in the new year, following the European Central Bank's decision to raise interest rates, mortgage-holders will be paying an extra €90 every month for every €100,000 borrowed.  For example, if a mortgage was €250,000 — not by any means substantial in today's terms — it will mean an extra €2,700 going on interest in 2006 than in 2005.  The mortgage relief announced in the budget is of little benefit to most people with similar or larger mortgages.

Young people today, who are already feeling the pinch from their very large mortgages, will see their repayments growing month on month for the next year.  We must focus on those people, whom the Government failed to protect in yesterday's budget.  The crisis is far greater than the Government is prepared to acknowledge.

The Minister of State should issue a public health warning to people that when they receive their SSIA cheques, they should put them against their personal borrowings rather than get carried away with the Government's idea that there is somehow a free flow and that everything is absolutely perfect.  One must accept the concerns regarding personal borrowing.

However, he will be retiring from this House next summer, and his pension will not be as good as that of the Minister who worked alongside him, who will probably receive between €2,000 and €3,000 a week.  The Minister of State has told elderly people in Laois and Offaly that they should kneel before him to thank him for giving them €208 a week.

The sum of €208 is cold comfort to most people in 2007.  It is not as fantastic as the Minister of State claims.  Inflation has far outstripped expectations over the past five years.  If the Government were truly caring and generous, it might even have gone so far as to make the fuel allowance non-means-tested for those over the age of 70.  It should do something constructive and positive for those we are discussing.As health spokesperson, I can only look on with dismay at the mess the Government has made of health services.  Leas Cross represents this Government's appalling legacy.  I do not know why elderly people should believe that it can protect them in the five months before the election when it refused to do so for the previous five years.  Members of the Government knew about Leas Cross and institutions like it five years ago.  They knew what was happening but did nothing about it, and that is this Government's sad legacy regarding care of the elderly.Living as we do under something more akin to a Fianna Fáil dictatorship rather than a democracy, there has been unbelievable collusion between Ministers and senior HSE officials in covering up an absolute scandal in the health services.

The Government has failed to meet its promises.  It cannot even take direction from the Supreme Court to arrange repayments to those elderly people whom it effectively robbed.  Some €400 million was put aside in last year's budget to make those repayments, but it managed to repay only €80 million.  It has failed to protect patients regarding legislation across a range of issues.Let us consider the sorts of promises made five months before the last election.  A social services inspectorate was promised, and that might have saved lives at Leas Cross if the Government had been prepared to spend the €2 million now going on its establishment.  It was promised five years ago but not delivered, and the cost today is €2 million out of a surplus of €4 billion.  Legislation was promised on the quality and standard of nursing homes, but again the Government failed to deliver.  Legislation was promised on eligibility.  Not only has the Government not delivered on such legislation; last night it voted through legislation to take elderly people's homes if they require private nursing home care.

The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has announced that she will set up an extra 100 teams.  To the best of my knowledge, the first 100 primary care teams announced in last year's budget have not yet been set up.  In my constituency, I could expect three such teams, but there is none.The Government made announcements in last year's budget that were not implemented in 2006 and makes exactly the same announcements for 2007.  It has lost credibility when it comes to delivering on its promises.  Not only has it not delivered on promises from five years ago; it has not even delivered on the contents of last year's budget.  Some 300 additional front-line staff were to be appointed in the area of primary care in 2006 but some of those jobs will not be advertised until February 2007.  A full year has gone by and the Government cannot even deliver front-line staff to the areas under greatest pressure in the health service.  Last year's budget included the provision of €80 million for IT projects in the health service.  These were small projects mainly dealing with value for money issues and patient care.  None of them has been delivered.  This is typical of the type of service we receive.At last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Health Service Executive officials admitted that even though the executive was established two years ago under the Health Act 2004, the complaints procedure has still not been approved by the Minister.  The Government is spending more than €10 billion per year on the health service but the reform programme is not working.  It is unacceptable that the Government is walking away from its commitment to public health services.  Health reforms are failing, the HSE is in crisis and the Government is too tired or incompetent to take on board the important job that must be done to reform the public health care system.The Minister's announcements regarding care of the elderly suggest the Government is trying to find solutions to short-term problems in the private sector.  The Minister for Health and Children's collocation plans, whereby private hospitals will be built on the grounds of public hospitals, seem to have been devised on the back of a beer mat.  It is clear that even some of those investors who were initially interested in such projects are withdrawing at a dramatic rate because they know this type of arrangement will not work.The comments of the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, during Question Time on Tuesday show they have no idea of the impact this policy will have on patients, particularly those with private health insurance.  It is clear the entire process is beginning to unravel.  This is typical of the approach taken by the Government.  The economy is strong and has been so for more than a decade but the Government is proceeding blindly without considering potential difficulties that may cause problems in two or three years' time.  It has failed dramatically to implement the most basic promises it made before the last general election.  It cannot even deliver the commitments it made in last year's budget.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should, rather than shouting at the Opposition, acknowledge that the Government is failing the public.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget provisions.  The Minister for Finance announced an additional €25 million for the delivery of psychiatric services under A Vision for Change.  This figure will only allow services to be maintained at existing levels, with 7.3% of the total health budget devoted to psychiatric services in 2006.  Next year, according to the Minister's figures, 7.2% of the overall budget will be allocated to these services.  There is no effective increase in funding at a time when there is greater recognition and understanding of the need to roll back the neglect of decades.  If there is a commitment to such action on the part of the Government, it is not evident in this budget.The Mental Health Commission has stated that "underfunding is reflected in the prevalence of mental disorder and generally negative and stigmatised attitudes towards mental illness".  For three or four years, questions to the Minister about the development of the psychiatric service were met with the response that we must await the report of the commission.  That report was published last January but we all had a good idea of what it would recommend.  The requirements in this area were outlined clearly in 1984 in the Department's Planning for the Future document.  All of us were aware of the need for multidisciplinary, community-based psychiatric services and increased provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  We knew of the negative effects of excessive waiting lists for psychiatric assessment and services, especially in the case of children and adolescents for whom a mild condition could become chronic during the waiting period.This budget does not meet our expectations and hopes that a corner had been turned.  The Government should immediately double the moneys allocated.  The standard of patient care in large mental institutions was severely criticised by the Inspector of Mental Health Services in his 2005 report.  Many of the wards in mental health institutions have little or no therapeutic activity, multidisciplinary input, regular physical or psychiatric assessments, or care plans for patients.  Community residences for former long-stay patients were found by the inspector to be an exercise in relocation rather than part of a rehabilitation programme.We must urgently address the shortage of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, community nurses, occupational therapists and family therapists to provide for the needs of those who suffer from a psychiatric condition.  Approximately 5% of people over 65 years of age suffer from some form of dementia, and a further 15% to 20% suffer other mental problems such as depression and anxiety.  People with intellectual disabilities have a higher than average risk of developing a mental illness.  Only two units are approved for inpatient care; the other units in which patients receive care are not subject to inspection and are outside the legal framework that protects patients' rights.We are all aware of what happened at Leas Cross nursing home.  There must be an effective system of inspection of those facilities where people with intellectual disabilities receive inpatient care.  We must be confident the service they receive complements their dignity.  People with mental health difficulties sometimes find themselves homeless and their problems then become more chronic.  It is unacceptable that psychiatric patients are being discharged from hospital onto the streets.  There is an urgent need for a hostel-type step-down facility from psychiatric institutions.  Local authorities should be obliged to provide for the housing needs of such persons.Child and adolescent psychiatric services account for only 5% to 10% of spending on mental health services but cater for 23% of the population.  This under-investment has resulted in a service that is at best sporadic and at worst non-existent.  The key to dealing with psychiatric conditions is to have a large input into the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  Early intervention, experts claim, gives a 90% chance of a full recovery.  A delay in intervention makes a condition chronic, with over 70% recidivism where people return to psychiatric hospital on a regular basis.  Early intervention is crucial in that fewer people will be in need of care in their adult lives and, as such, that will have a knock-on effect on adult psychiatric services.It will also have an effect on suicide rates.  Up to 80% of people who take their own lives suffer from a psychiatric condition.  In excess of 200,000 children have a mental or behavioural problem at any one time, with one in ten having a disabling problem.  More than 1,900 children under the age of 18 years sought addiction treatment in Dublin, which amounted to 20% of all new attendances.  Suicide accounts for 30% of all deaths for the 15 to 24 years age group.  In 2004, 11,200 adolescents presented at accident and emergency departments after causing self-harm.  Approximately, 5,330 children and adolescents have autism spectrum disorder.  Eating disorders are rising every year.  Will the Minister for Health and Children examine funding in this area?  While it may not have been dealt with in last Monday's "Prime Time" programme, the levels of death from suicide and other disorders are the highest of all psychiatric conditions.Last year the National Office for Suicide Prevention received funding of €1.2 million.  There was no statement in the budget for next year's funding.  In Scotland, where inroads have been made into reducing suicides, its suicide prevention office receives an annual budget of Stg£10 million.  In the context of the amount of moneys flowing into the Exchequer, it is not unreasonable that the National Office for Suicide Prevention be allocated €10 million.

His main concern was about total national personal indebtedness.  He did not deal with the issues that governments must worry about.  There is no doubt that some people, as always happens, have borrowed beyond their means.  Deputy Twomey claimed that society as a whole had borrowed beyond its means.  He more or less said if Fine Gael was in government, it would stop people borrowing money.  It is the function of the Central Bank to ensure credit policy is run correctly.  Its obligation is to ensure lending institutions do not lend money beyond people's means to repay.  Market forces will also dictate that.  If banks were reckless in their lending policies, their business would be in jeopardy.In a strong economy many people have the borrowing capacity and can afford to repay loans.  Thirty years ago when people bought a house, they paid it off and did not borrow again.  People now have higher aspirations.  Many home owners have bought a second property in Ireland or abroad and they do not face any pressure with such borrowing.  Those under pressure are the first-time buyers.  One has to identify where the problem might be and deal with it.  That was the reason one change made in the budget related to a particular group which faced the most pressure, the first-time buyer with a loan.Some first-time buyers are in the fortunate position to already have the full cost of a house.  They will not benefit from the budget because they do not face any pressure in repayments.  The Government has, in a clinical way, made sure that those under pressure, due to the rising price of an essential commodity, the first home, have been given a leg up.Fine Gael complains about borrowing levels.  When we introduced the SSIA scheme to cool the economy and create a habit of saving, we were scarified by the Opposition for encouraging this type of saving.  The cap on the SSIA proved it was very much the ordinary person's saving vehicle.  It has proved to be a huge success, helping many people to learn about saving.It is extraordinary to hear Fine Gael on national finances, the area in which we have total control.  It is interesting to compare this year's figures with those from 1987, the last time a Fine Gael-Labour coalition had a long run at it.  In 1987 the interest bill on the national debt was £2.7 billion per annum, 33% of the tax take.  Despite the growth in the economy, in 2006 we paid only €2.4 billion, 5% of the tax take.  That is good management of the funds that we are directly charged to manage.  In 1987, the Fine Gael-Labour Government borrowed £1.5 billion on the current account, spending only £770 million on capital projects.  In 2006, the account is in surplus of €8.9 billion, allowing us to spend €7 billion on capital projects, almost ten times the 1987 figure.There is a similar trend in our total national debt.  It is amazing to think that the national debt doubled between 1983 and 1987 to €30 billion.  Today it is only €38 billion in an economy, as I have illustrated in the figures, up to ten times larger.  We are getting the fundamentals right.  We have a strong, confident economy and growing employment, which have created the stability we need for growth.  Our second task is to ensure money is spent wisely.  In my limited time I will focus on two issues, the first of which is carers.We all know from personal experience that those who care for other people in their homes contribute, in a quiet way, much to society.  Traditionally, our social welfare code has not allowed people to claim two social welfare payments at once.  In an innovative move we have changed that for carers in recognition that they are providing a service, both to the person for whom they care and to society.  After the change in this budget, a carer aged over 66 years who has a contributory pension will be €125 per week better off.  It is adding virtually 50% to their income and is an overdue recognition of their contribution.  It is a real recognition by this Government of the significant contribution these people make to society and the heavy burden they carry.  It follows on from a series of improvements that have been made for carers in recent years.I would also like to focus on the additional €100 million that has been provided for disability and mental health services.  One must take this in the context of the money provided two years ago in a rolling programme for the improvement of services for people with disabilities and the 10% increase in the recent Estimates.  We all know from dealing with the disability services that there is a need for extra investment.  I hope this €100 million, which has been given for residential, respite and day places and other service improvements, will lead to an incremental improvement in services to the most vulnerable in our society.Our attitude in Government has always been that one cannot spend what one does not make.  We must first, therefore, ensure we have a sound and growing economy that is buoyant and brings in revenue so we can provide better services to our people.  Without doing that there would be no largesse.  We would return to 1987 when there was no surplus funding and could be no improvement in services.  No matter how much money one has, one must then decide in a focused way where priorities lie.  I am delighted social welfare increases accounted for over half of the extra expenditure in this budget.  This shows the Government is focused on those least well off in society.  It is also focused on young people trying to get their first house.  This is a budget with a vision and a mission to help those who need it most.  I am delighted to have been able to say these few words and commend this budget.

I am pleased to note that it reflects the most comprehensive package of environmental measures ever announced in a budget.  This package cuts across all major economic sectors and shows that the environment, particularly climate change, is a matter not just for my Department but extends across the full breadth of the Government.Ireland supports the international efforts to tackle climate change and plays its part in the co-ordinated global response.  We will meet our Kyoto target mainly through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in our economy.  We will also meet it through contributing to the cost of projects to reduce emissions elsewhere in the world, as allowed for under the protocol.  The Government has announced its commitment to invest 18 million tonnes of carbon allowances during the Kyoto commitment period of 2008-12.  I welcome the provision of a further €270 million to fund a programme of purchases up to 2018.  This budgetary commitment underpins our support for the Kyoto Protocol and for developing countries and will allow us to meet our targets under the protocol without damaging the economy.I am bemused by the carping of some on the Opposition benches who, despite their holier-than-thou rhetoric would have us repudiate the mechanisms laid down by Kyoto at the expense of our hard-won prosperity.

The Kyoto Protocol established that it makes good sense to buy carbon credits because it is concerned with a global reduction.  By saying it would not avail of the carbon credit purchase scheme the Opposition signals to industry that it will shut it down, create unemployment and reduce confidence in the economy.  It was better for us to take the sensible, logical and constructive approach.  We will demand more from industry, make provisions to reduce emissions and continue to be innovative in the pursuit of the reduction of emissions.

The Government has approved the publication of the carbon fund Bill and intends to introduce it to the Oireachtas next week.This is only part of our approach to climate change.  We are also committed to large reductions in our domestic emissions.  To that end my Department will examine the motor taxation system with a view to bringing it more into line with environmental policy objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  We also aim to provide a further incentive to the motoring public to drive cleaner cars and this will most likely impose an additional cost to those who drive higher emission vehicles, and justifiably so.

The programme was established in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation of witnesses.Although legislation was not required to establish the programme, it was recognised that complementary legislative provisions might be required in due course.  A number of provisions were subsequently enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Under these provisions, it is an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the programme and for a person to intimidate or put in fear any person who is assisting the Garda Síochána in the investigation of an offence, or is a witness, potential witness, juror or potential juror in criminal proceedings, with the intention of obstructing, perverting or interfering with the course of justice.  The programme has been very successful and it has demonstrably contributed to securing convictions against very serious organised crime figures.In 2003 the Court of Criminal Appeal criticised aspects of the operation of the programme, in particular the perceived lack of sufficient structure to its operation.  The programme's legal basis was not questioned and the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld its operation, as did the Supreme Court subsequently.Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, the Garda Commissioner immediately appointed an assistant commissioner to review the programme in its entirety.  That review was substantially completed in 2005 and enhancements to the administration and operation of the programme have since been implemented.  For obvious reasons of security, I am loath to detail these enhanced measures.  However, the witness security programme now operates according to international best practice in the balancing of the needs of law enforcement with the needs of the protected witness.  This includes separating those responsible for the criminal investigation from the management of the programme.  There must be a Chinese wall between the two.  Professional informant management protocols have been set up and the social and emotional needs of the protected witness are considered.A number of policy matters arising from the Garda review remain under consideration by Garda management.  As the final product of internal Garda considerations is not yet available, it would be premature of me to decide upon possible avenues of further progress, including the introduction of new legislation.  The witness security programme constitutes only one element of the State's response to witness tampering and intimidation.  The programme is primarily designed to facilitate persons who are prepared to give evidence against alleged erstwhile criminal associates and admittance to the programme may involve relocation and identity change.  Such extensive protection measures may not be appropriate for all witnesses.  The Garda Síochána continues to operate comprehensive police protection measures before, during and after the criminal trial involving witnesses outside the witness security programme.

I am not aware of the conviction of a major gangland crime figure in the past few years.  I am concerned the programme is not being used to the extent it might.  The review followed serious criticisms by Judge McCracken who indicated that the scheme was badly thought out and that clear guidelines were needed.  The review seems to have been internal and interminable.  Could a senior retired judge, in whom we could have absolute confidence, undertake an objective review of the scheme?  Does the Minister accept my concerns?The moneys expended under the scheme seem to be falling.  In 2002 almost €1 million was spent, in 2003 and 2004 over €1 million was spent but the sum has fallen to half that amount in the past few years.  Does the Minister accept that we should make greater use of the programme?  We should follow international practice by ensuring the scheme has a statutory basis.  Any common law country has a statutory basis for such a scheme.

Doubtless, he will agree that it is a demand led scheme.  I make funds available and if the Garda Commissioner believed four or five times that amount was necessary for the administration of criminal justice, I would find the money.  There are no external constraints.The Deputy states we have not seen the fruits of the scheme, such as a major trial where the scheme is in operation, in recent times.  I have not seen references or press reports of this scheme being used recently.The Deputy makes a good point on objective independent assessment of the scheme.  I have received assurances that it is operated to the standards of best international practice.  I have also appointed three inspectors to ensure Irish police activity is conducted to the standards of best international practice.  The Deputy referred to an external senior retired judge.

A review could assess how the scheme is operating and if it could be improved.I am prepared to enhance the existing statutory arrangements if more protection is needed.  Statutory protection is afforded to those in the scheme but if more is necessary, I would not hesitate.  The best course of action is to determine whether the scheme is operating well and then to decide if further statutory provisions are necessary.  I would be happy to do both.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	239	There have been 20 murders with firearms since the beginning of this year to 6 December.  There were 19 murders with firearms recorded for the same period in 2005.  While any level of murder, by a firearm or otherwise, is unacceptable, it is incorrect to state there has been an upsurge in firearms murders this year.  Sadly, it is roughly the same as it was last year.Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda Síochána in combating serious crime and, in particular, murder.  The operation which commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region in May 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at my request has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the operation.  I am pleased to note that the number of offences of discharging a firearm was stable in the third quarter of this year, the most recent full quarter.  Operation Anvil has contributed significantly to this and also to the increase in that quarter in the number of detections of offences of possession of drugs for sale or supply and of cultivation, manufacture or importation of drugs, which are clearly associated with many murders using firearms.The most recent figures available indicate that since the introduction of Operation Anvil, 549 firearms have been seized in the Dublin metropolitan region.  Up to 19 November, Operation Anvil resulted in more than 3,350 arrests for the serious crimes of murder, robbery, burglary and serious assaults, including 56 arrests in connection with murder, in the Dublin metropolitan region.  Outside the Dublin metropolitan region, up to 1 November, 2,600 persons had been arrested and 238 firearms seized.  It is not, therefore, a question of nothing happening.In November 2005 the Garda Commissioner augmented the organised crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 gardaí to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons being arrested, thereby disrupting criminal plans.  There has also been an increase in Garda monitoring and targeting of individuals and groups involved in armed crime, in particular.Following the completion of the weapons amnesty on 31 October, the mandatory minimum sentences for possession of firearms came into effect on 1 November.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The penalties available to the courts have now been greatly strengthened and stringent penalties apply.I am very satisfied with the outcome of the 2007 Estimates process.  The allocation for the Garda Vote is increasing by €135.3 million to €1.445 billion, an increase of 10% on the figure for 2006.  This year's budget, in turn, represented an increase of 13% on that for 2005 and an increase of 85% in real terms since 1997.  The additional overtime allocation included will yield almost 3 million extra man hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.  As a result, innovative and targeted anti-crime strategies and operations such as Operation Anvil will be continued and intensified on a nationwide basis.  This budgetary increase demonstrates the Government is continuing to provide record resources for anti-crime strategies.The Government is also committed to increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána.  I am informed that the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 on 16 November, following the attestation of 299 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 21.5%, or 2,298 in the personnel strength of the force in the period since.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November resulted in a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training of 14,137.  Next year will see more than 275 fully trained gardaí graduating from the Garda College every quarter, allowing the Commissioner to focus a highly visible policing presence throughout the country.I stress that all killings, regardless of the background of the victim or the method of killing, are the subject of a rigorous investigation by the Garda authorities.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The opening part of the Minister's response indicates complacency towards what anybody outside the House would regard as an upsurge.  The Minister has indicated that last year's figure for gun murders was the worst on record and to say there has been no upsurge is not a satisfactory reply.  I last asked this question on 9 November, by which stage there had been 16 gun murders in the State this year.  Less than one month on there have been four more in Limerick, Ballybough, Swords and Drogheda.  The number of one per week, giving an annualised rate of 52 for a full year, represents an upsurge in any man's language.Will the Minister accept that the most depressing facet of all is the murder detection rate?  The last time I asked for figures last year was indicated as having the poorest detection and prosecution rates ever for this type of crime.  Of the 21 gun murder cases last year, only four were regarded as having been detected.  Perhaps the Minister has updated figures.  Proceedings had commenced in only two of the 21 murder cases.With only a few weeks left this year we have already reached a figure of 20 gun murders, with an additional four murders in the past four weeks.  Although I salute the Garda for Operation Anvil, does the Minister accept that there is a new criminal gangland culture that needs a different approach?  The targeting and monitoring indicated by him must be greatly increased to ensure these thugs who are seen to act with impunity and with no regard for human life will be taken off the streets.

There is no complacency on my part.  I have been in regular contact with the Commissioner, assuring him all resources possible.  I have strengthened the law and made available vast sums for overtime for surveillance operations, etc.  I will carry out any action I am asked to carry out.  There is no lack of commitment on my part in tackling this issue.Sometimes we have short memories.  Last year and this year have been bad but there has been no dramatic difference between the two.

The Deputy referred to four shootings in Limerick, Ballybough, Swords and Drogheda.  My best information is that there were a variety of motives behind the offences.  Two were quasi-domestic, to use a terrible phrase, while two appear to be drug-related.  It is frightening that the people engaged in drug killings now seem to feel they have a right to sort out domestic or quasi-domestic disputes by using firearms.The resources allocated to the Garda Síochána have been increased by 10% on the figure for last year.  The amount allocated for overtime, which is very important in terms of surveillance and search operations, has also been increased substantially; it is up by 13% on the figure for 2005 and 85% in real terms since 1997.The strengthening of the numbers in the Garda Síochána is proceeding apace.  The fully attested strength of the force reached 13,000 on 16 November, compared with a figure of 10,702 on 30 June 1997.  This represents an increase of 2,298 members.

I have no function in appointing persons to such boards.  In the particular case neither I nor the Commissioner was personally aware of the appointment.  The Commissioner has informed me he would not have approved of the appointment if it had been brought to his attention.  It is a matter for the Garda authorities and the Public Appointments Service to determine the appropriate vetting arrangements to apply in appointments to such interview boards and the procedures to consider all the available information on potential board members.I am very anxious that nothing is done to affect the good standing of the Garda reserve in the eyes of the people and have communicated this view to the Garda Commissioner who shares my perspective completely and the Public Appointments Service.  The very fact that this controversy has arisen underlines the need for care.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person referred to sat for one day on a two-person interview board in Sligo for the selection of trainee reserve members.  It is not in keeping with best practice and, as far as the Commissioner and I are concerned, it will not happen again.

My concern is whether the culture within the force has changed.  It is largely agreed that for the Garda Síochána to regain its position as a respected and trusted protector of the peace, the organisation must root out the small but disproportionately influential core of mischief-making members who damaged the reputation of the force with such detrimental effect.How can we weed them out when retired members of the force linked so closely to wrongdoing in Donegal are brought in to recruit new members of the force?  I wish to highlight the lack of communication between the Department and the Garda Síochána.  One of the key concerns voiced by Mr. Justice Morris was the issue of effective communication between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda headquarters.One of the most glaring omissions from the Minister's raft of reforms to date is the establishment of an independent Garda authority.  It seems the Minister states he and the Government act as a Garda authority but that is not good enough.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I propose to bring forward a number of amendments to the law on bail in the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which I hope to publish early next year.As the Deputy is aware, two statutes are relevant to the operation of the arrangements for bail.  The Bail Act 1997 deals with the system generally and gives effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution.  Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides a sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence.Earlier this year I announced the Government had approved the drafting of the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which will address a number of issues relating to consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.  As I mentioned, section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on a sentence passed for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire if more than one is being served.  It also provides that where a consecutive sentence applies, the fact the offence was committed while the person was on bail shall be treated as an aggravating factor by the court when determining the sentence.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions indicated that, at present, the intention of the consecutive sentence provisions can be avoided in certain circumstances, namely, where an offender is not brought before the court for the offences in the chronological order in which they were committed.  This can happen due to the varying pace of investigations into different offences.  The criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will close off that loophole.The Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the ad hoc group on the administration of bail which was established in response to the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 2001 annual report.  These concerns related to the administration of bail with particular regard to inefficiencies in the system for collecting money due on foot of the estreatment of bail.  The ad hoc group reported in October 2003 and work is ongoing on the preparation of legislation for inclusion in the Bill to reflect the group’s recommendations.Additional information not given on the floor of the House:The amendments I propose to introduce will allow the courts the option to set bail terms that do not include financial commitments.  Alternatives might include reporting to Garda stations or surrender of passports.  They will also allow the courts discretion on whether they order estreatment, provide that estreatment be enforced by way of a penal warrant which is the mechanism applicable to the collection of fines rather than the current system of distress warrants.  They will also extend the six months time limit to 12 months during which summary proceedings may be brought for breach of bail conditions, or alternatively, treat such failure as an indictable offence where no time limit would apply.  I believe these proposals will address the issues that gave rise to the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

The most recent figures available suggest these total more than 5,000 per year.  The 2004 figures were 5,300 and the latest figures I have are for 2005 which saw an increase to 5,600.I note the minor changes proposed by the Minister.  Does he agree more radical changes should be made to our system to cope with this serious problem?  Should the Director of Public Prosecutions be able to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the grant of bail?  At present, the Director of Public Prosecutionsd can appeal to the Supreme Court.  However, as the Minister knows, that is a rarefied body which is difficult to access.Does the Minister accept a case can be made for extending considerably the provision whereby bail can only be granted by the High Court in serious drugs or firearms cases?  At present, the only provisions which require granting of bail by the High Court are murder, piracy, genocide and treason.  A person in a serious drug or firearm case should not be able to walk into the District Court and be granted bail.  The matter should automatically go to the High Court.Does the Minister have views on the use or availability of electronic tagging where someone is released on bail?  Does he accept that in circumstances where someone is convicted of a serious offence and it is clear a custodial sentence will be applied, the issue of whether that person is released on bail should be separately argued before the judge?  What often happens is such a person is automatically released on continuous bail pending a sentencing hearing that may not take place for six or nine months.  Does the Minister agree there is scope for change in that situation?

The deterrent of making the sentence for any subsequent offence run consecutively does not seem to be as strong as it was hoped at the time of the bail referendum and when the 1984 legislation was passed.  I agree with the Deputy that this is the case.  There are a number of issues involved.  First, the Deputy raised the possibility of extending the type and number of offences in respect of which bail would not be granted, other than by a decision of the High Court, in regard to serious offences.  I suppose the Deputy possibly has in mind drug dealing and homicide offences other than murder and the like .  There is an argument for this.  The only problem is, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, one is then stuck with the proposition that an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court is a bit improbable and, therefore, one would have to restructure the Court of Criminal Appeal as an almost permanent court which would be available to decide on an appellate basis these kind of cases.

Having three judges sitting, as the Court of Criminal Appeal normally would consist of, on bail appeals could be quite a significant deployment of judicial resources especially when, by definition, the right of appeal of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be in cases where the first judge had taken the view that the person should be set at liberty.  There is an issue here which will be dealt with in the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which will afford this House the opportunity on Committee Stage to consider amplifications of the bail jurisdiction or variations of it at the moment.  It is a difficult issue and I fully agree with the Deputy that it is not one where the present situation is satisfactory.

The purpose of the pilot project was to develop an integrated programme co-ordinating the work of the civil and criminal judicial systems and other key agencies such as the Garda, women's support groups, perpetrator programmes and the probation and welfare service in the Dún Laoghaire-Bray area.  The project arose from research undertaken into the development of an intervention model which it was suggested had operated successfully in other jurisdictions.The project originally received funding of €118,024 to undertake this pilot project within a year.  Requests for additional funding were made by the organisation on a number of occasions to enable it to complete the pilot project.  In the years 2004 and 2005 the NDVIA received additional funding of €320,000, bringing the total funding made available for the pilot project in the Dún Laoghaire-Bray area to almost €440,000.  This is a considerable amount of taxpayer's money in my view for a pilot project.My Department commissioned an external evaluation of the pilot project and while the findings of the consultants were reasonably positive, they identified a number of elements of the original project proposal which had not yet been satisfactorily completed.  It was deemed important by my Department that these elements be completed and that the procedures developed by the NDVIA, under the domestic violence intervention project would be formally recorded so that the possibility of their replication in other areas might be fully considered.My Department agreed to make a further and final amount of €90,000 available to the domestic violence intervention project to facilitate the completion of the final elements of this pilot project and the documentation of the procedures which had been developed as the key outcome of the project.  It was agreed with representatives of the project that this work will be completed by the end of January 2007.  I will not commit myself or my Department to any further funding activity arising out of this project pending receipt of a full report on its completion and an internal review by my officials of its outcome and conclusions.

Why has the Minister, to date, not made provisions for this to happen?  If he is planning provisions, when are they expected?The NDVIA has piloted a positive scheme in the Dún Laoghaire and Bray court districts involving a set of work practices that seek to maximise victims' safety.  Independent evaluation of the pilot has shown that crucial supports from the NDVIA have encouraged victims to stick to the legal process rather than drop out and suffer the consequences, as victims have done in this society.  The NDVIA monitors and tracks offenders' behaviours and provide risk assessments to the courts.  Does the Minister of State agree that the role and work of the NDVIA has been vital in the pilot area and that such a role is absolutely vital into the future and should be rolled out nationally, particularly in the absence of this role being undertaken by the probation and welfare service?The NDVIA also engages in bilateral work with key agencies such as the Garda, the Courts Service, the probation and welfare service, the HSE and the Judiciary through training, promoting and standardising recording procedures in the scandalous area of domestic violence.  The Minister of State said he cannot guarantee funding into the future because he is awaiting a report which he expects to receive in January.  Will the Minister of State ensure that on receipt of the last report, there will be a quick turnaround — because funding for the project ends in February — to ensure there is no stalling of this scheme, if he agrees to go ahead with it and that victims of violence are not left without the supports of this vital service?  Will the Minister of State meet with the intervention agency or arrange a meeting between it and officials from his Department as soon as possible to discuss the options for the extension of this pilot scheme to ensure that funding and the project can continue beyond February 2007?

Could interim funding be provided after the report is handed in and pending the decision on the funding to ensure this agency continues to operate for the few months it takes the Minister of State, his officials and the Department to come to a judgment on the operation of this in order that there would be some continuity?  It would be terrible to lose the expertise because of a lack of interim funding.  There might be a gap of six months or a year while the Minister of State and his officials make up their minds as to whether this project should be continued as a pilot or rolled out nationally.

I am a little perplexed by this because when I looked at the report on the Internet, it stated "the eircom PhoneWatch Burglary Report was conducted by the OSG Group, the country's leading loss adjuster, based on a sample of more than 10,747 household insurance claims in the twelve months between 1st June 2005 and 1st June 2006".

Otherwise they would be very vulnerable to fraudulent claims.I find it somewhat perplexing that the figures in this survey which is partial and based on a loss adjuster approach are different from those of the Garda Síochána, given that I would expect every loss adjuster's burglary report to be required, by definition and on a prudential basis, to be reported to the Garda.On the methodology of the report, I am not clear whether the statistics are compiled using the strict legal definition of the offence of burglary.  If a bicycle is taken from a front garden, some might call it a household theft case, but it is not regarded as a burglary in the Garda statistics.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I am not; I am just trying to explain the difference because the Deputy's question is a serious one.  It implies that a private sector body's report seems to differ substantially from that of the Central Statistics Office.  I am slightly perplexed about how there could be such a wide divergence.  It could be a definitional matter.  A possible explanation is that the taking of a garden spade from a back garden is classified as a household burglary, although it is not.It is unclear whether the figures relate to the company's clients only or if account has been taken of the increase in the company's client base, which according to the report amounted to 17% in the past year.  Many more people are using the PhoneWatch system.  Therefore, an increase in the number of complaints through that system would give rise to these statistics.  I am just positing these points as possible explanations for the divergence.  In addition, the report states its figures are based on a sample of household insurance claims for the period in question.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseFor these reasons, I do not believe the figures in the report are directly comparable to the statistics based on Garda Síochána data.  Those statistics have until recently been compiled and published by the Garda Síochána, but the provisional headline crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 were compiled and published by the CSO.  The CSO will compile and publish all future crime statistics, following my commitment to bring the CSO's independence and statistical expertise to bear on the compilation of the crime statistics.The CSO figures for the third quarter show an overall decrease in headline offences of 1.6% compared with the same quarter in 2005.  They also show a decrease of 12.2% in burglary offences in the quarter.  While they show an increase of 23.1% in aggravated burglaries, this represents a very small increase in absolute terms, from 65 to 80.  With regard to the second quarter, compared with the same quarter in 2005 there was a decrease of 9% in burglaries and no change in aggravated burglaries.With regard to the Dublin metropolitan region, the Garda Síochána's annual report for 2005 shows there was a decrease of 4% in burglaries for the year.  During the longer period of 2003 to 2005, there was a decrease in the Dublin metropolitan region of recorded burglary offences of 5%.  While there was, however, a 6% increase nationally in burglaries in 2005, there was a decrease of 2% in aggravated burglaries.  In response to this, the deputy commissioner, operations, commissioned an assessment of the causes of the rise in crimes of burglary in the year.  That assessment has contributed to the improvement in the figures in 2006 to date.A significant contribution to the improvement has also been made by Operation Anvil which commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region in May 2005 with the aim of addressing the problem of serious crimes such as robberies and burglaries and of combating an emerging gun culture.  At my request Operation Anvil was extended outside the Dublin metropolitan region during 2006.  The most recent figures available to me show that the operation is having encouraging successes.  Up to 19 November, there was a total of 3,349 arrests in the Dublin metropolitan region, of which 1,701 were for burglary and 796 for robbery.The Garda Síochána Act provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area to provide a forum where a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas Members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  The Garda Síochána relies on the ongoing and active support of the public to enable it to be at its most effective in its functions.  The committees will have a useful contribution to make in reducing the incidence of crimes such as burglary by mobilising the resources of the local authority, the community and individual residents.Twenty-two joint policing committees are being established by local authorities and the Garda Commissioner in a pilot phase and I intend to extend them to all local authorities in 2007.The Garda supports and fosters a number of crime prevention measures that have direct value for householders, including the neighbourhood watch scheme which was established in 1985 by the Garda as a crime prevention measure for urban areas.  There are approximately 2,600 neighbourhood watch schemes in operation.  Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in neighbourhood watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such initiatives.  The Garda Síochána has been a strategic partner in driving and supporting Neighbourhood Watch through its community relations section and local Garda management and has deployed crime prevention officers and liaison gardaí to assist schemes.In addition, the community alert programme is a community-based crime prevention initiative in rural communities which was set up by Muintir na Tíre in association with the Garda Síochána in 1985.  It is a national movement with its network comprising of approximately 1,249 local community alert groups dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities who are vulnerable, in particular the elderly, by crime prevention, neighbourliness and self reliance, general community safety and well-being, accident prevention, promotion of personal safety and having an antipoverty focus awareness of social inclusion.  My Department has for some time funded the work of development officers working to expand community alert.I am strongly of the view that community organisations have, through their support and co-operation with the Garda Síochána, an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety and I very much support the work in this area being carried out by Muintir na Tíre through community alert.I recently determined priorities for the Garda Síochána for 2007 under section 20 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  These priorities include achieving an increase in public confidence in law enforcement through significantly increased high visibility policing in the community; monitoring and improving response times to emergency calls while ensuring persons reporting any crime are dealt with sympathetically and efficiently; using the civilianisation process and the outsourcing of appropriate services to increase the number of gardaí on operational duties; and taking effective steps to protect vulnerable people living in isolated areas.I am confident these priorities will help in combating burglary and reducing the fear thereof in society.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	286	We have had a statistical analysis rather than a response from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In truth, the Minister has acknowledged the report is based on the work of an independent company with no axe to grind.  It sampled nearly 11,000 household insurance claims by people who certainly believe they were burgled, regardless of the statistical gloss the Minister puts on the statistics.The Minister is correct and my question was wrong in that the report indicates an increase in the burglary rate of 35% outside Dublin.  This is an extraordinary increase.  There has been an increase of 26% nationally.  The Minister might question the figures today but he should note that the original response to the statistics on the website, which response was by a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was that following an increase in the number of burglaries in 2005, the Minister requested the Garda Commissioner to assess the causes of the rise and to take action to tackle the problem.  The Minister obviously accepted the facts at face value initially although he might want to muddy the waters somewhat now.  Even without data such as these, one will know, from clinic cases and calls, that the problem has worsened.  I received two calls in this regard today, including one from an elderly couple who were burgled in their house in New Ross and, therefore, want a panic button.Does the Minister agree that one of the most surprising and worrying trends is the increase in the number of burglaries that occurred when residents were at home?  The original PhoneWatch survey, using the same methodology as the survey under discussion, showed that 50% of household burglaries occurred when the occupants were at home.  This figure has increased to 70%, as indicated in the most recent survey.  The new brazenness of burglaries generates even more fear and danger.Does the Minister agree that my proposal to reconstitute the Garda Síochána to provide more effective community policing which has received considerable public support is important and appropriate in addressing the real fears and vulnerability of householders in both urban and rural communities?

Visible community policing and the use of mountain bike patrols and the like comprise a very strong counter-agent to burglary.Deputy Burton who tabled the question seems to have gotten one point wrong because the burglary report states "Dublin continues to top Ireland's burglary table with a 12% increase in burglaries, representing 35% of all burglaries nationwide".  The Deputy's question states there was an increase of 25% in the rate of burglaries and 35% in the Dublin area.

It states that in the 12-month period between June 2005 and June 2006 the number of burglaries increased by 26% nationally.  It is correct that one third occurred in Dublin.

The CSO highlighted a rate of 12.2% in burglary offences in the third quarter.  It is not a case of my trying to manipulate the figures.  I am pointing out that the CSO has been given the job to monitor crime figures and that what it is saying does not seem to correspond——

It reminds me of the old saying about "lies, damned lies and statistics" and I am not being unparliamentary in saying so.  Perhaps my approach is based on my being from west Cork, but I note we have approximately 500 burglaries every week.  This is a horrendous figure and we should not really be talking about whether the rate increased or decreased by 1%.  We should accept that burglaries are causing considerable fear and concern and, as Deputy Howlin rightly pointed out, yet more concern is being generated because so many of them occur while the home owners are actually at home.  We should be talking about how we can tackle this.On the Minister agreeing with the approach in respect of community policing, is the bottom line not that we are paying for not putting in place the extra gardaí promised four years ago?  Regardless of whether we are referring to community police or others, we do not have sufficient numbers.  Until the 2,000 additional gardaí promised are provided, we will not have enough for community policing or other forms of policing in the State.

I understand from the Garda inspectorate that work on its report is well advanced and that this will be furnished to me in January 2007.

I first tabled this question on 1 October and received a similar response, without a date but to the effect that the report was not yet to hand.  I hoped the inspectorate would have moved with alacrity.Since the publication of the Barr report, less than lethal weapons have been issued to the emergency response unit, ERU.  The Minister indicated to me in a reply to a previous parliamentary question that three varieties of non-lethal weapon, bean bag shot, pepper spray and ferret pepper spray shot have been issued to the ERU.  What are these devices?  What evaluation has the ERU made of their usefulness to date?  Has the Minister any plans to provide at least the pepper spray or any of the other devices to the rest of the gardaí, some of whom find themselves in difficult situations with no protection other than a baton?

We are considering the use of the Taser gun which fires a projectile consisting of an electrode stunning the victim electrically.  It has been used in the United Kingdom and other places.  It is an effective weapon but can cause problems.The Deputy expresses some degree of impatience with the inspectorate's report.  It is considering the issue of the Abbeylara report in the round, not just these weapons.  Its task is to return to me next month to tell me whether the internal response by the Garda Síochána to the Abbeylara report has been adequate.  There was a very complete response to the criticisms of the procedure set out by Mr. Justice Barr.  I await independent third party verification as to whether changes in its methods and training in response to that report have been adequate.

I am glad to see it being taken on board.Of greater concern, however, is the fact that we expect approximately 3,000 members of the Garda Síochána to carry weapons on our behalf and have firearms certificates but they no longer have a dedicated firing range.

The Garda took advantage of this option during the recent incident in Gort.

The relevant subsection, (1)(a), was commenced in 1993.  It will be noted that this subsection covers persons under 14 years of age also.Section 16 also makes provision, in subsection (1)(b), for the video recording of a statement made by a person under 14 years of age, in respect of whom a sexual offence or an offence involving violence is alleged to have been committed, during an interview with a member of the Garda Síochána or any other person who is competent for the purpose.  It provides that such a video recording shall be admissible at a trial as evidence, provided that the person whose statement was video recorded is available at the trial for cross-examination.  I accept Deputy Howlin is not under any illusions in this regard but there appears to be a public misunderstanding that it is possible to simply record a package and give it to a jury and thereby save a child the——

The existing legislation does not exclude cross-examination and it makes it a condition of the use of this material that the child is available for cross-examination.  There is a public misconception that somehow children would be spared the duty of being cross-examined if the defence elected, if we would only introduce a video system.A committee that was established by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has drawn up good practice guidelines covering a number of areas.  The committee made a number of recommendations, including recommendations that sufficient suitable facilities should be available for video recording evidential interviews, and there should be a joint national programme in place for training interviewers, which should be regularly reviewed.  In tandem with this, there will be a national training programme for all professionals who are likely to have reference to the guidelines.I attach the highest importance to the setting up of these facilities.  The Secretary General of my Department and the director general of the National Children's Office have taken a personal interest in ensuring this is done as soon as possible.  Officials from my Department are actively working on setting up these facilities in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the Office of Public Works.  My Department plans to have a network of suitable facilities available to the Garda Síochána to video record evidential interviews established at a number of locations throughout the country early in 2007.

That was all put on the record at that stage.  When I specifically asked whether this measure would be in place by the end of the year, the Minister replied that he hoped so.  The most recent response gave no timeframe.  The Minister is now saying it will be early next year.  We have to move with alacrity on these issues.  Where an inter-agency dialogue is required, as in this case between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Health Service Executive, an important issue like this has to be driven politically.  At least, we now have a date for the first time and I will hold the Minister to that date.  I ask him to give an assurance to the House that he will personally ensure the date he has given will be realised.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I am aware of these recommendations because, as the Deputy may recollect, I am a member of the committee to which he referred.  I have brought the report to my Department where it is being circulated and evaluated.  I pay tribute to the Members of both Houses who participated in the proceedings of that committee.  It is unfortunate that two or three controversial issues were cherry-picked out of it for public attention even though the report is a substantial one containing many other issues.  I refer, for example, to the current identification parade procedures which I regard as indefensible.  Another important matter is the capacity of an alleged perpetrator to personally cross-examine a child victim in court.  All those issues have been dealt with comprehensively.Regardless of the fact that one of the central proposals in the committee's report is dependent on the passage of a referendum, that should not be a comfort zone for official Ireland in looking at the other issues which do not require any delay pending a referendum.  I am anxious that all the proposals in the committee's report that do not require legislative change should be addressed as quickly as possible.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The Central Statistics Office's recent publication for the first time of the provisional headline crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 is welcome in providing further expertise and independence in the compilation of such statistics and in acting as an important aid in informing policy formulation and public opinion.While being mindful of the need for caution in the interpretation of such statistics, especially when attempting to extrapolate any trends over short periods, the CSO report provides us with important data in regard to drug offences statistics and trends.  Unlike other serious crimes such as murder, armed robbery, rape, burglaries and the like, the drug figures in the CSO statistics reflect successful Garda activity in combating the drugs menace.  I, therefore, welcome the increased volume of detections and seizures that these figures represent.On the basis of what we all know is happening in society, I would be worried if the figures were going down at this stage because that would reflect a lack of Garda success.  Bearing in mind that there is a significant drugs problem in Ireland, we should be careful not to say it is scandalous that the number of offences in the CSO figures has gone up because it is indicative of Garda activity and detections.  It would be worrying if they were going down without any adequate explanation.Some of the key information which the report provides in this regard includes the following: there is an 8.6% increase in the total number of drugs offences recorded for the first three quarter period of 2006 in comparison to the equivalent period for 2005; there is a 23.8% increase in the total number of drugs offences recorded for the third quarter period of 2006 in comparison to the equivalent third quarter period for 2005.  That shows the trend of enforcement and detection is going in the right direction.  There was a sizeable increase of 153, or 25.8%, in the number of offences relating to the possession of drugs for sale or supply of drugs offences recorded in the third quarter period of 2006 compared with the third quarter period of 2005.  The trend shows that drugs are increasingly being found in bulk.  While the Government views with concern any apparent rise in the level of illegal drugs being trafficked into the country, seizures are also a reflection of the strength of activity by the Garda in targeting the drugs trade.  The issue of drugs is dictated by global developments and not confined to any country.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I thank the Minister who I join in congratulating the Garda — I presume that was implicit in his comments — on a very high detection rate.  I was amazed when I received the additional information not provided on the floor of the House when this question was asked last month.  In the first ten-month period of last year the Garda seized 12 kg of heroin with an estimated street value of €2.4 million.  There has been a significant increase in the comparative figure for this year to 115.75 kg with an estimated street value of €23.1 million.  Is the Minister as shocked as I am at the implications of a ten-fold increase in heroin seizures between last year and this year?The Minister has indicated to the House that the UN office estimated that seizures of cocaine and opiates represent approximately 25% of production.  If we are seizing 25%, there must be a vast volume of heroin available in the State.  Does the Minister accept that despite a massive tenfold increase in the number of seizures, there seems to be no lack of availability of the drug or a fall in its price?  These circumstances indicate that a vast volume of heroin is available throughout the State.  Does the Minister acknowledge that the volume of heroin available in the State has increased phenomenally?  If so, what specifically does he intend to do about it?

Does the Minister have a view on this?  While I pay due compliments to the Garda for the extent of its seizures, do we have any idea of the extent of a problem which seems to be growing enormously?  Is there evidence of widespread breaking of the law in the consumption of drugs by those from whom one would expect better?  Does the Minister have a view as to how that might be addressed?

Operation Anvil has had significant successes and a great deal of intelligence gathering and surveillance has taken place.  One can take two views of the figures.  One might adopt the view that there has been a vast increase in the amount of drugs being imported in the last year while the Garda continues to seize the same proportion of them.  It is a pessimistic view.  The other view one can take is that the Garda has had major successes which it was not having last year and its performance has improved, which is the optimistic view.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	371	If that is the case, the price should have gone up.

I am not in a position to say whether there was a vast increase in heroin imports to Ireland, which the Garda is seizing in the same proportion, or whether the force's successes on foot of Operation Anvil have led to more significant seizures as a proportion of the total amount of drugs being imported.

Issues like price on the street are relevant in that context, but they require a great deal of analysis.  While I am not in a position currently to tender such analysis to the House, I make the point that there have been spectacular Garda successes in interdicting heroin, cocaine and firearms in recent times.  Those successes reflect the fact that gang activity is growing as well as the fact that Garda competence is growing in response.  I am not in a position to say where we should form our judgment of the truth between the extreme optimistic and extreme pessimistic views.  By definition, these are murky matters.

If more are coming in, the Garda may be having a greater level of success in the context of an increased rate of importation.  However, it is not possible for me to give an exact judgment on the matter.  As I said recently to a Labour Party Deputy, I intend to convene a meeting of the Customs and Excise and Garda to form an indepth, strategic view of the issues involved, including on-the-street prices, to determine the direction of underlying trends.While I do not wish to be sanctimonious about the question put by Deputy O'Keeffe, it is undoubtedly the case that there are some in our society who believe it is their privilege to make up their minds privately in their homes as to whether they consume cocaine or other drugs, which is no one else's business.  I do not know how many of them there are.  I have repeatedly made the point that their view is completely immoral and wrong-minded.  Nobody can take drugs of any kind without sharing in the moral responsibility for underworld crimes, including murder, which result from the availability and consumption of narcotics.

A Minister for Finance framing a budget is like anyone else who must sit down to present something which must be done in a balanced way.  One can increase or reduce expenditure, increase taxation or play with any of many variables.  It has never been an easy task for a Minister for Finance since the foundation of the State to get the balance right.  It is never easy to achieve the perfect synchronisation of the various elements which must come into play.  It is obviously much more difficult during a recession or when a large current budget deficit is being run, which is certainly not the case currently.  There is an overwhelming responsibility on any Minister for Finance to be fiscally responsible to ensure the finances of the State are in a good and positive position and that any further problems along the road can be addressed.In his economic preamble, the Minister made it very clear he was setting the following fiscal targets for 2007: a projected general Government surplus of 1.2%, an increase in gross current spending of 11.5%, an increase in gross capital spending of 13% and a gross debt-GDP ratio of less than 25%, one of the lowest in Europe.  No Minister for Finance, no more than any other Member of the Dáil or any member of the public, knows precisely what is coming down the road in terms of the rest of the world.  Interest rates are much higher in the United Kingdom and the United States than in the eurozone.  Many people in the USA are talking about a slowdown in that economy.  A slowdown in the US and-or British economy would normally affect Ireland because of the levels of trade between Ireland and those countries.  In that context, I was very glad the debt-GDP ratio is 25% and no higher.  The Minister is clearly storing up reserves of borrowing potential for the future in case that rainy comes, which is very prudent.I draw attention to section D.15 of the Budget Statement, a table showing the trend in national debt and general Government debt.  The table covers the period from 1983 to 2005.  The period from 1983 to 1988 had a most alarming rise in debt as a percentage of GNP in the history of the State.

Before I entered this House, most of my political experience was on Dublin City Council.  Throughout that period of 18 or 19 years, I witnessed the Fine Gael Party being very responsible when it came to the city finances.  However, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Labour Party.  On many occasions the city manager was faced with a financial difficulty and the choice was to cut back services or introduce service charges.  The Labour Party refused to support either option.

While I would not say I was critical of other aspects, there were some I would like to have seen handled differently.  For example, as I said last night, I do not believe the 50 cent increase in excise duty on a packet of cigarettes was enough to make a significant market difference in discouraging a large number of young people from smoking tobacco.  I understand what the Minister said about its relationship to the consumer price index and I accept the point the Taoiseach made in the debate last night when he said that raising the price of cigarettes too much would increase the level of smuggling, which is already very high.  Nevertheless, the Irish Cancer Society had proposed a €2 increase in excise duty on a packet of cigarettes, which would have been a good idea.On property taxation and stamp duty, I commend the change in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers for seven years which will have a very positive impact on hard-pressed first-time buyers.  Had it been my budget — it probably never will be my budget — I would have suggested some changes in the stamp duty regime.

I accept what the Minister has said.  If he had cut the rates of stamp duty, sellers might have simply pocketed the difference.  There is a serious problem.  Nevertheless, I propose that the issue of stamp duty should be examined by a committee of the Oireachtas, perhaps over a period of years.

The vast majority of public servants who are either directly employed by the State or who work for semi-State agencies are hard-working, conscientious employees who give value for money.  We must, therefore, examine the management structures that obtain in the public service and in semi-State organisations.  Considerable amounts of duplication and overlapping occur in many areas.  Given the large amounts of money being disbursed by means of the Estimates and the budget, it is time to examine the financial structures of the State.The Minister for Finance has stated the budget supports pensioners, young families, enterprise and the environment.  Overall, it is an excellent budget.  The Government should be returned to power, although I accept that this may not happen.  I look forward to the Minister for Finance introducing a budget next year that will contain even further tax reductions and further benefits for society.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	424	There are a number of provisions in the budget which, although long overdue, should be welcomed.  A start is being made in respect of a number of areas in the welfare sphere and I wish to comment on these.  The first relates to the recognition of people who provide caring services to family members.  Until now, if these individuals were in receipt of another social welfare payment, they were precluded from receiving any recognition or thanks in respect of the important work they do.  I welcome the fact that we have made a start on providing that recognition.  I accept that it is only a half-rate carer's allowance but nonetheless I welcome it.The other matter to which I wish to refer in this regard is the commencement of improvements that have been promised in the area of adult dependants.  This matter has been neglected in the past and it is something about which many people, particularly women, are concerned.  Having given a life of work inside or outside the home, women were angry about the fact that they were not automatically entitled to pensions in their own right.  In my opinion, a great deal more could have been done but I welcome at least the start that has been made in respect of the recognition of their contribution.In the area of tax, a number of reforms were introduced by the Minister in the budget.  While long awaited, these are still to be welcomed.  By any standards, however, and bearing in mind the unprecedented resources available to it, what we were presented with yesterday was the very least that people could have expected from the Government.  The budget's provisions go nowhere near compensating the people of this country who have been overcharged and overtaxed in so many different ways in recent years.  The so-called unexpected excesses in revenue, totalling over €2 billion, speak for themselves.  Regardless of the route this cash has taken to the Exchequer or how it is labelled, all of that €2 billion originated in the pockets and purses of ordinary taxpayers.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Why did the Government withhold it for so long and why has it taken so long for a small amount of it to be returned?The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism stated before the Ryder Cup that it would be unpatriotic for anyone to overcharge visitors to this country in any way.  He condemned this practice out of hand, and rightly so.  How much more unpatriotic is it, therefore, for the national Government to overcharge its hard-pressed citizens with high and sneaky charges and taxes on houses, cars, fuel and so many other necessities?  In its final months, the Government, which has been in power for nine years, is at last fulfilling its long awaited promise of a payment of €200 per week for pensioners.  How much less is that money worth now than when it was originally promised?  Why did the Government leave the most vulnerable until last?  That has always been the way with the Government.  Vulnerable people of all kinds have been left to wait, despite the billions spent and the tens of millions wasted on projects such as electronic voting, Abbotstown, PPARS, integrated ticketing and so many others.The latest line from Ministers and backbenchers is that we are the victims of our own success.  Deputy Ellis used it in recent days when referring to traffic congestion.  The Members opposite also state that the problems we face are those that relate to success.  They should try telling that to the many thousands of people who spend hours sitting in gridlock on the M50, to parents whose children cannot obtain access to psychiatric services or to the many families who live in overcrowded conditions — with their parents or in-laws — and who have no chance whatsoever of obtaining social housing.  The last thing the Government will do is accept responsibility.  This Administration was elected to govern and to manage the country properly.  According to it, however, the problems are always someone else's fault."Caring for the Needy" was the slogan used at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  If Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats care for the needy, I would like them to answer some questions.  Why is it that they illegally charged thousands of pensioners nursing home fees?  Why did they wait until their final year in office to announce the renovation of 1,300 dilapidated school buildings that so many pupils have been obliged to endure for so long?  Why did they force intellectually and other disabled people to resort to the courts to obtain justice?If the Government cares, why did it tolerate a situation in private nursing homes where elderly patients were neglected and abused?  Why, after nine years in office, with so much money at the Government's disposal, do we still have patients on trolleys in hospital corridors?  There is precious little evidence that Fianna Fáil cares at all for the needy.I wish to address something fundamental to the economy and the social life of this country.  By and large, it was completely overlooked in yesterday's budget.  The area has suffered long-term neglect from the Government.  I speak of the critical role of housing in everyone's life.  It is worth considering what has happened in that regard over the years.  In 1967, the average house cost IR£4,000 and the average industrial wage was IR£1,000, meaning that the ratio of house prices to income was 4:1.  Thirty years later, the average price of a house had risen to IR£100,000 and the average industrial wage was IR£20,000.  In 30 years, the ratio had risen only slightly, to 5:1.  However, a mere nine years later, in 2006, the situation is as follows.  The average price of a house is €350,000 and the average industrial wage is €35,000, giving a ratio of 10:1.That extraordinary turnaround in the basic cost of living over the last nine years has brought enormous changes to virtually every aspect of Irish life.  The Government's denial of a house to hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers on single or combined annual incomes of less than €80,000 is the greatest setback to this country's traditional way of life ever experienced.  During the Government's time in office, some 515,000 houses have been built, a mere 8% of which have been affordable.  Some 92% of all houses built in that time have been unaffordable for most average-income people.That means that average-income earners, single or married, have been denied the right to home ownership previously enjoyed in Ireland.  Categories such as nurses, teachers, skilled workers and gardaí on a single income can no longer afford to buy a modest house.  The great work done by the city and county councils throughout the country in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s in building hundreds of thousands of affordable houses in many fine council estates has now been completely negated, as they are out of the reach of most people on average incomes.In the short and long term, the increased cost of property will be borne by the sons and daughters of current homeowners, either through exorbitant prices if they are fortunate enough to be able to buy or, most unfortunately, by those who can never afford a home of their own, a life-changing experience.  We have reached the stage where ordinary people on modest incomes find it impossible to aspire to home ownership.  That is not progress, since we have gone backwards.  It is not just that home ownership has become unattainable for those in cities and major towns, ever more people are moving out to access affordable housing, in the case of the greater Dublin area to the dormitory towns of neighbouring counties.In many cases, their lives can only be described as unsustainable.  Couples get up at 6 a.m. and drop children off at very expensive child care at 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m.  Then they face the daily commute, which for many living in Meath, Kildare or Wicklow and further afield means two or three hours.  There are long journeys in the morning and evening, after which they return home exhausted, frustrated and angry to pick up their children.  They get to bed only to get up for work and go through the whole process again the following day.Many thousands of young couples are living that sort of crazy lifestyle and yesterday's budget does nothing for such individuals.  We are condemning an entire generation of people to a situation where they live to work, simply to pay the mortgage and other bills.  After many years of economic growth, surely people are entitled to a better quality of life.  The public will not be taken in by some of the provisions made yesterday.  A few bob were distributed here and there regarding the various welfare payments and a small amount was returned in tax changes.  Overall, however, the story of the Government over the past nine years has been one of mismanagement and incompetence.  For many people, that has meant a much lower quality of life.  People will not be taken in and I believe the Government will hear their answer next year.

It was a simple listing of events that had taken place in the course of the year, with no imagination, flair or real hope for people.  For example, there was very little in the budget for the 20% of the population identified in the recent Deloitte and Touche report as being fuel-poor, those suffering from energy poverty.  The occasion was curiously flat, and even allowing for the pre-arranged standing ovation started by Deputy Cregan and back bench colleagues including Deputy Kelly, it felt like a day in which we were going through the motions, with very little new to discuss.  The Government was simply trundling on towards the general election.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Certain measures in the budget were obviously very welcome and Deputy Shortall referred to the changes affecting social welfare recipients accessing carer's allowance.  Over the years we have found that a tremendous difficulty for people.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs' iron rule has been that one may benefit only from a single social welfare allowance.  That change certainly has to be welcomed.  However, the Carers Association and the 150,000 people this evening caring for invalids want the means test to be addressed.  The Government continues to rigorously enforce the means test.Likewise, the passing of the €200 barrier by the State contributory pension is to be welcomed.  However, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and a number of other senior citizens organisations were hoping that a pension of approximately €215 per week would have been achieved from 1 January.  That was not to be.  The Government did the minimum that it could, just as it did in many of its other measures in taxation, energy and elsewhere.  The overall effect was flat and gave an "as you were" sensation.There were many areas to which the Minister for Finance did not refer, such as education, health care and child care.  On the "Today With Pat Kenny" radio show he said he dealt with these areas in his previous two budgets and would return to them if the Government is re-elected.  Yesterday's budget lacked vision.  The Government has no idea how to use the €9 billion overall, or €4 billion net, which the Minister could have put into key social policy areas.It was interesting to compare the performance of the Minister for Finance with that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer who yesterday addressed the House of Commons, our sister parliament.  The Labour Government has had a long-term strategy for energy and climate change.  It has published three separate major reviews on energy.  It has promoted the idea of the carbon emissions mechanism and market and has a clear energy agenda.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, probably the future British Prime Minister, laid out the way forward.  By contrast, as our Green Party colleagues have already said, the Minister, Deputy Cowen's speech was simply a greenwash.  It was an attempt to wrap a green, environmental flag around him while doing next to nothing.The Government raised expectations that the budget would have at its heart serious measures to increase and support the development of renewable energy, tackle climate change and address the soaring levels of fuel and energy poverty.  The Taoiseach seems to have undergone another Pauline conversion.  His previous conversion was from dedicated capitalist to socialist and he has now gone from dedicated socialist to green eco-warrior.  We need not have worried — the overall commitment to encouraging renewable energy and energy efficiency was uninspiring.While the announcement of a new programme of grant aid for the production of bio-energy crops was welcome, as our Fine Gael colleagues already alluded to, there was no new thinking, vision or significant funding that would help farmers and rural communities.  When one thinks of the substitution that could take place — 200,000 gallons of oil per day, most of it imported — one regrets that no significant steps were taken.Funding for the greener homes scheme was increased by just €20 million.  The programme has proven popular with the public but needs to be significantly enhanced to allow middle and low income families install new renewable energy technologies.  I noticed that at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a tranche of micro-generation measures that the Government was going to launch.  It was just like the wind that blows through windmills.  It was a load of Fianna Fáil waffle.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The issue did not gain any impetus yesterday.In its pre-budget submission, the Combat Poverty Agency urged the Government to taper the subvention of SEI's greener homes towards low income households to ensure that all new social housing would be fitted with alternative energy sources.  The Minister for Finance took no action in this regard and neither did he take any action on the homes of the future.  On RTE radio this morning, the Minister spoke with a company involved in construction.  The company was deeply disappointed that the Minister ultimately responsible for social and affordable housing failed to take action on sustainable energy.  Sustainable Energy Ireland itself received just €3 million for the development of a pilot energy efficiency programme for small and medium sized enterprises.  However, there was no mention of the national energy efficiency programme.A recent meeting of the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, attended by Deputy Durkan and me, passed a budget of a single euro to permit the spending of €2.5 million on the "Power of One" campaign.  This campaign has been nothing other than a public relations exercise.  Why did the Power of One campaign not start with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources showing leadership by using a hybrid car?  We are still waiting for this to happen.The EU has asked Ireland to embark on a monumental, 75-step process on energy conservation.  It is seeking an energy reduction of 20% by 2020.  The Labour Party believes this is a reasonable target and we should embark on that road.  However, the Minister for Finance ignored this area in his speech yesterday.  There was no additional funding for projects such as smart metering which would allow householders to determine simply and precisely how much electricity or gas they are using.  Smart meters make this much easier than the complex existing meters.I recently spoke to a manager with the Viridian Group which operates the electricity grid in Northern Ireland.  He told me that because they have had a Labour government for the past ten years, they are much further down the road than us.  They have installed smart and other meters to advance the green agenda.  They have done this because they have a government with a sustainable energy policy.  That is the fundamental difference between the two jurisdictions.  Above all, they have a Prime Minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer who have been committed to a sustainable energy strategy for well over a decade.Perhaps our Fianna Fáil colleagues are shimmying up to the Green Party in order to create an alliance after the general election should they win fewer than 70 seats.  They are throwing shapes and making eyes at the Green Party's seats and trying to winkle them out of any possible alternative government.

Everyone expected the Minister for Finance to grant a fuel allowance of at least €25.  Despite the increases in fuel costs, this allowance is still means tested.  The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, which does important work in representing senior citizens and State pensioners, campaigned for a minimum increase of €25.  The Minister for Finance, however, has granted only a miserable increase of €4.  Moreover, he did not enlighten us as to the quantity of electricity to which pensioners and others on benefit will be eligible this winter.  Despite the recent reductions in the projected increases in the cost of electricity and gas, this remains a serious issue.  Gas prices increased by 34% three months ago and there is a forthcoming electricity price increase of 13%.  The last two winters were among the coldest of recent decades and senior citizens and other persons on low incomes now face into another cold winter with the prospect of high energy costs.

I am sure even the Deputies sitting opposite me, who probably had no input into this measure, are ashamed of it.Earlier this year, I made representations on behalf of some constituents in respect of the insulation grants that are awarded by the Health Service Executive.  I discovered, to my horror, that the HSE north-eastern area had exhausted its annual funding for this initiative by April.  I have since raised this issue on the Adjournment.  The HSE north-eastern area was told by the Ministers for Health and Children, and Finance, and by the Taoiseach, that it would not receive any more funding for the scheme in 2006.

On what is perhaps the key issue facing humanity, the need to secure and sustain energy supply, the Minister for Finance had little or nothing to say.  The budget contributed nothing to the issues of energy policy and climate change; there was merely a sense of flat disappointment.  This represents a total failure to meet the challenges of our times.  The budget is a damp squib in this respect.A significant proportion of the population, perhaps as much as 20%, is hopelessly badly served in terms of the availability of broadband.  Wireless services are available in some locations but they are incredibly expensive.  I recently addressed a public meeting in Stamullen, in Deputy Johnny Brady's constituency, where I heard that nobody in the vicinity has access to broadband.  This is also the constituency of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The main incumbent seeks at least €200 million to extend broadband availability to the entire country.  The Estimates provide €10 million for this purpose, leaving a deficit of €190 million.  The Minister for Finance, however, has allocated zilch for this critical infrastructural development.In general, yesterday was a disappointing, flat day in respect of the communications, marine and natural resources portfolio.  It may be the last time this Administration will have the opportunity to allocate resources in this or any other area.

It is a well balanced budget, which includes significant increases in pensions and social welfare allowances and generous tax incentives.  It also provides comprehensive measures to safeguard our environment and to ensure continuing economic growth.  The budget is clearly sculpted to ensure an equitable distribution of the wealth created by workers in our economy.  It will also ensure the economy does not overheat and that there is something left in the kitty should the economic environment deteriorate.I wish to focus on the importance of small businesses to the economy.  Each year, the global entrepreneurship monitor, GEM, benchmarks Ireland as one of the most entrepreneurial economies in Europe.  Entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, have emerged as the engine of economic and social development throughout the State.  SMEs and the businessmen and businesswomen who establish and drive enterprise continue to play a central role in our economic miracle.  These companies make invaluable contributions to many local economies, providing employment prospects where few existed and delivering new and innovative products to customers both at home and in overseas markets.  Their ambition, creativity and the contribution they make to the lives of people throughout the State should not be underestimated.Enterprise Ireland has primary responsibility for the development of indigenous SMEs in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It offers a range of supports aimed at assisting client companies to expand and compete in the international marketplace.  Enterprise Ireland client companies, which are mainly indigenous SMEs, employ more than 140,000 people.  They also invest a total of €17 billion annually in payroll, raw materials and services, thereby boosting their local economies.Small firms face challenging new realities, not least the changing structure of the Irish enterprise base.  Ten years ago, for example, exports of software by indigenous companies amounted to €57 million.  Today, exports in this sector by Enterprise Ireland client companies amount to more than €1.3 billion.  As a country with a relatively limited domestic market for both products and services, it is imperative that small Irish companies with ambitions to grow continue to seek opportunities in overseas markets.Future economic success, both domestically and internationally, will be greatly influenced by several factors.  Companies must be in a position to undertake sophisticated research, development and innovation, and they must be able to identify the training needs of staff.  In its strategy, Transforming Irish Industry, Enterprise Ireland focused on how best to accelerate the development and internationalisation of Irish owned business as a priority for future economic development.This budget represents a milestone in improving the environment for small business.  It will further incentivise research and development and protect our competitiveness.  The budget will provide a significant boost to the 250,000 small businesses operating in Ireland and the 800,000 people they employ.  The measures announced will continue to support and develop the spirit of entrepreneurship.I welcome the extension to 2013 and the radical enhancement of the business expansion and seed capital schemes at a cost of €25 million in a full year.  The almost fivefold increase in the business expansion scheme investor limit to €150,000 and the doubling of the company limit to €2 million will significantly enhance the attractiveness of the scheme.  These changes will tackle the difficulties faced by small businesses in raising capital to pursue entrepreneurial risk-taking.  Fostering the growth of wealth-creating enterprises is of central importance if Ireland's economic success is to be sustained in the long term.  These changes will incentivise people to invest in start-up companies rather than investing in property abroad.I also welcome the increase in the VAT registration threshold to €70,000 for goods and €35,000 for services.  Of benefit also will be the increase in the cash basis threshold to €1 million.  These measures will greatly encourage early-stage entrepreneurial activity and will support small business development into the future.  They will also greatly reduce compliance costs and remove 8,000 businesses from the VAT net.  This is testament to the Government's commitment to reducing administrative burdens on business, particularly small businesses.The trebling of the small business threshold for the payment of preliminary corporation tax from €50,000 to €150,000 is welcome, as are the provisions for new companies.  This new simplified system will further ease the administrative and accounting burden for the 97% of companies to which it will apply.  The substantial income tax relief package will further incentivise employment, reduce labour costs and reward workers.  Ireland has the second lowest tax wedge in the OECD.  The enhancements of the budget will further reduce the tax wedge and incentivise work.  Ensuring those on the minimum wage stay out of the tax net will also assist those who are unemployed to transfer to the active labour market.  The budget delivers for business, workers and sustainable prosperity.I welcome the improvements to the research and development tax credit estimated at €70 million in a full year.  The increase from three to six years for tax benefit for incremental research and development will not only enhance the value of the incentive but provide critical longer-term certainty for both indigenous and foreign direct investment companies, making key strategic decisions to invest in or locate research and development activities in Ireland.  It sends a clear signal to business that the Government is supporting their efforts to develop new products and win new markets.  The wealth created by these industries can then be redistributed to other areas of the economy such as the health services and social welfare.

Deputy Ned O'Keeffe summed the budget up very well as it is all give and no take.  As we are 200 days away from the general election, the Opposition Members are getting panicky, as they should.  However, not being political, if one takes this budget objectively there is much for many.  If the Evening Herald, not a great supporter of Fianna Fáil, claims the Minister for Finance delivered a fair budget, we must be on the right track.I represent a constituency with a large urban population.  For those Members who cannot remember, I represent Dublin South-West, which embraces Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills, Brittas and Bohernabreena.  As a backbench Fianna Fáil Member I believe in representing the concerns of my constituents to the party leadership.  While the economy is doing well, we should be looking after the vulnerable and senior citizens.  The Government has shown its caring side in the packages announced in yesterday's budget.  As the Taoiseach recently said we must be mindful that a rising tide may not automatically lift all boats.  The little boats need that little extra attention.  I am glad to be a Member for a party that has done this.The Taoiseach described the budget as one of commitments — making them and meeting them.  He pointed out it is a budget for enterprise, workers, pensioners and family.  Many Opposition Members have broadened the discussion which is why the Chair had to issue its warning.  However, it is important to remind ourselves of the progress we have made.The Tallaght I moved to — I am not originally from Tallaght but had to move there with an employer — is a different place today from what it was then.

While a lot has been done, there is more to do.  I am glad there has been progress in job creation.  The budget gives opportunities and assistance to those who want to create jobs.  It is also important to remind the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that we need to look after those who are vulnerable.I am not going to take lectures from Opposition Members on what Fianna Fáil does for the elderly.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I compliment the Minister for Finance on a marvellous budget.  It provides a massive boost for rural areas and hard-pressed farmers.  I welcome the renewal and extension of a series of farm tax reliefs, income tax relief and capital gains tax relief at a cost of €14 million in a full year.  The two farm stock reliefs are being renewed.  The general stock relief allows 25% of any increase in stock values in a year to be allowed as a trading expense.  For young trained farmers, the relief is set at 100%.  The stamp duty relief for farm consolidation, where two farmers exchange land, will now apply where only one farmer meets the consolidation criteria.  The amount of the tax exemption for long-term lease of farmland is being increased to €20,000 per annum for leases of a duration of ten years or longer.  An exemption from capital gains tax applies to disposals of farm land outside the immediate family on retirement.  The present threshold for the exemption is €500,000 and this is being increased to €750,000 from 1 January 2007.  Where farmland that has been owned and worked by a farmer for over ten years is leased for less than five years and is subsequently disposed of to the person leasing the land, the present retirement relief will also apply.The last three changes are aimed in particular at encouraging the transfer of farm assets to younger and more progressive farmers.  The various measures will require EU state-aid approval before they are implemented.  The farmers' flat rate of VAT is being increased from 4.8% to 5.2% with effect from 1 January 2007, at a full-year cost of €16 million.  This flat rate is designed to reimburse non-VAT registered farmers for the VAT they pay on their inputs.  This increase reflects a number of changes in the method of calculating this refund rate following consultations with the farming bodies.  These consultations are ongoing.A competitive farming sector is the key to developing a sustainable rural community.  Speaking to the leaders of different farming organisations and people from the farming community in general here yesterday they were pleased with the Minister, Deputy Cowen's provisions for rural Ireland in this budget.  It is important that, as farmers are increasingly freed from the constraints of production quota and price supports, they are given the necessary assistance to enable them to invest and innovate and by so doing to be in a better position to compete in an increasingly globalised market for farming produce.  It is also important that such assistance is prioritised to young farmers and to those farmers who have risen to the challenges posed by changes arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and WTO negotiations.  The package of rural development measures recently agreed with the farming organisations as part of Towards 2016 has been widely welcomed.  It means Government support for farming will more than double in the next rural development period compared with the present one.This is a time of great change in farming.  New schemes of aid for restructuring in the food processing sector, while not directly involving farmers, provide an essential underpinning to adapting our agriculture and food sector to the new realities in EU and world farming.  Increases of 15% in forestry premiums and 17% in REPS payments, as well as substantial support for on-farm investment to help meet the requirements of the nitrates directive, reflect our growing concerns about the environment and our awareness of the important role farmers play in protecting our environment.I welcome the extra €100 million for health-related disability and mental health services announced in the budget.  This continues and expands the Government's €900 million multi-annual investment programme announced in budget 2005.  This extra €100 million will provide additional residential, respite and day places and other service improvements.  The funding will also support the introduction of Part 2 of the Disability Act, which provides for assessments of need and service statements for people with disabilities.  These important provisions will start for children under five years with effect from 1 June next year.  The funding will also support the continued implementation of the plan for mental health services, A Vision for Change.  This builds on the national disability strategy which is a comprehensive and wide-ranging approach to improve the quality of life for disabled persons and to underpin their participation in society.  The strategy, backed by considerable levels of investment, also promotes greater co-operation between Departments in the planning and delivery of services for the disabled.  The budget acknowledges and reinforces this valuable work.  In 2006, we allocated €3.3 billion for disability-specific services across Departments.  This has been increased by another 10% for 2007.I am delighted that the budget will make it easier for ordinary taxpayers to claim and receive their rightful entitlements.  Claiming reliefs must be made simpler and easier.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I welcome this opportunity to participate in this budget debate and I support the third budget of my friend, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  The measures announced in yesterday's budget build on the sound economic policies which have been consistently pursued by the Government since 1997.  This country has made remarkable economic and social progress during that time and the majority of Irish people acknowledge this progress.  We have come a long way and witnessed a major transformation of our great country.  The nature and scale of the transformation is one of which we can all be proud.  The budget for 2007 aims to consolidate, sustain and promote growth in our economy while rewarding work by continuing to reduce tax to ensure that all workers will be better off.  Budget 2007 helps those on low incomes with a spend of €15 billion in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As my colleague, Deputy Johnny Brady, said, we will have the opportunity to discuss each of those areas in the social welfare debate next week.Budget 2007 also supports young families and helps first-time house buyers and rural and urban economies.  Like all previous budgets introduced by this Fianna Fáil-led Administration, this budget strikes an appropriate balance between the competing demands any Minister for Finance must address.  I support the budget strategy and priorities.  Our economic and social success is due not to one particular budget but to tough decisions, sound strategies, ambitious targets, vision and determination over a long period of time.  It was with great interest that I heard on our national radio, as many people did, the comments on the 1987 budget by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry.  Although he was sharply criticised by the Opposition in this House, it has been proven that he took the correct course of action.  He was one of the good Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance who helped to achieve what we enjoy today.This Government's policies, strategies and ambitious targets are right and a well educated population worked hard to turn this country around.  As a small, open economy, our fortunes are determined to a large extent by developments in the global market.  I highlight the important contribution our membership of the EU makes to our national well-being.  Ireland has achieved success beyond measure and beyond the capacity of a nation our size.  Since our entry to the EU, we have diversified the economy and gained a reputation abroad for skill, determination and the manner in which we adapt to changing markets.  Ireland is the envy of many larger European nations.For a person of my age, who used to see Germany and the United States as strong countries, it is interesting that Ireland, a small dot in the Atlantic Ocean, is in a far stronger position than those two countries.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Ireland can be proud of its role in Europe and its achievements.  We are in a position to address the ills in our society.  We can sustain and protect our progress to date.  Every person wishes to see the good times continue and if global forces impact on our position, safety measures must be in place.  We wish to see our children enjoy quality of life, with opportunities in abundance.  We want our parents cared for in old age with dignity.  People with disabilities must be appropriately accommodated.  We want employment opportunities, good salaries, disposable income and foreign holidays to continue.  We can do this if the progress of recent years is maintained and built on.The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, has done much work on the development of our economy and economic policy.  Europe has been a catalyst for change in economic policy.  It has given guaranteed access to the European markets, attracting overseas companies because of EU membership, our domestic policies and the work of the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department.The adoption of the euro by Ireland, the first English speaking state in the eurozone to do so, provided unique opportunities.  The structural supports and investment received turned around our competitiveness and put us on the international market map.  The overall outlook is positive but we must remain vigilant and our domestic policies must be sound.  The economic background to the budget is very good.  Our GDP and GNP remain strong and our ability to create jobs continues, with job creation set to reach 72,000 jobs, or 1,400 new jobs every week.  The total number of people in employment is over 2 million, a remarkable performance.

I propose to share time with Deputies Ferris and Catherine Murphy.Our task is to be aware of where we can go from here.  No one denies or laments the major economic success of this country.  As politicians, we should not preen ourselves and be blinded by self-righteousness in taking credit for how we got here.  Rather, we should examine where we want to go from here and the values underpinning how we spend our money.  That job remains undone.  The political question is what to do with our economic success.  These values can be determined by how we care for the weakest in society and whether we value caring, such as a someone raising children or a child caring for an elderly person.  This Government did not value such work in the budget.We must maintain the economic prosperity that we are fortunate to experience.  As a Member who shadows the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am concerned by the statistics of the past ten years regarding output and exports from the indigenous services and manufacturing sector.  There is a worrying decline.  I welcome the proposals to encourage such enterprise, particularly the extension of the business expansion scheme, BES, and the increase in the amount one can invest in it.  I also welcome measures that encourage small business, such as alterations to the VAT threshold and easing the regulations.The Government has decided, with the support of the Opposition, to invest in research and development.  Why has this not led to increased licences, product development or exports from the indigenous sector?  This should be the primary concern for any politician.  We should amend policies to ensure we receive a return on our investment.  There is no sense of that in the budget.  No change is planned in Enterprise Ireland or elsewhere to signal concern at evolving trends.  We have failed to develop an enterprise economy.  I do not take pride or pleasure in this fact; it is the reality based on these statistics.  We have had a property economy based on the tax breaks provided over the past ten years.  The concern is that property growth could put the economy under pressure if it decreases.I regret that there was no reform of the stamp duty regime.  I do not refer to the fundamental reform sought by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, regarding the abolition of stamp duty.  However, the system could have been amended to allow a more functional property market with social benefits.  The Green Party has proposed the amendment of the property system to allow those trading from a larger to smaller property to avail of a lower rate of stamp duty.  I have yet to hear a strong argument from the Department of Finance or the Minister as to why this would not work.  I do not believe it would lead to any inflationary pressures in the housing market as it would only bring about an increased supply of those types of family houses abundant in my constituency, close to shops, bus routes and schools, but which do not have young families in them.  They are very expensive.Anything that would free up the supply in that end of the housing market, which would be the consequence of the move I have outlined, would have significant benefits and take some of the heat from the property market.  There is an over-reliance on that market as a wealth-generating sector, and to take some of the heat from it would be fundamentally beneficial to the development of our economy.The other long-term threat glaringly clear to anybody with any sense of analysis of the next ten, 20 or 30 years relates to the future energy scenario for this country.  Two factors require action from any reasonable and responsible Government.  The first is the simple and clear realisation, the geological certainty that we are facing a peak in global oil production which will be followed by a steady 2% to 3% per annum reduction in oil supplies.  As this country relies on oil for 60% of its energy needs, this is a fundamental priority that should be addressed.The US Department of Energy commissioned a report which stated clearly that such a peak should be addressed two decades in advance in order to change the economy's infrastructure to suit this new post-peak oil production.  There is nothing in the Government's budget, the Green Paper on sustainable energy or any of the strategies being prepared by the Government that recognises such a reality.  I note with interest that the budget is able to include provisions for pensions going forward to 2050, which I laud.  It should be equally possible for us to look forward to an energy future to 2050 and to begin extrapolating budgetary policy to address it.Possibly a more profound energy change facing us is the way in which our current burning of such fossil fuels is changing the climate on which we all depend.  The Irish perspective may be that a rise of a degree or two in temperature might not be too bad, but that is only until one's house is flooded or we see people starving in Africa.  There are 150,000 dying each year, as calculated by the World Health Organisation, because of that climate change which we, among other developed countries, are causing.The Government is not being honest with the Irish people on what is needed in this area.  As part of the European Union it has signed up in recent climate change negotiations to at least a 15% reduction in 1990 emission levels by 2020.  I can only describe the Minister for Finance's environmental section of the budget as honest, and it is clear that rather than reducing emissions we are continuing to let them increase and trying to buy our way out of the problem.  Such an approach is morally bankrupt, with the country on the one hand committing to cut emissions by 15% below 1990 levels by 2020 and on the other hand following policies which we know will lead us 30% above those levels in 2010.  These are simple bald statistics about what we are committing to, what is right to do and what is actually being done.  They put the Irish people in a morally impossible and financially reckless position.The €270 million committed in the budget for us to buy out carbon emissions to 2012 is actually a fraction of what the final bill could be.  The figure is based on a hypothesis that the climate change policies of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resource will achieve something, but nothing has been achieved in the past ten years.

The €270 million figure could be doubled.After 2012 there will be a new environment where that will only be a first step.  Further large fines are possible if this fundamental and crucial issue is to be addressed.  The approach of this Government to climate change is fundamentally dishonest, although that is difficult to get across to the electorate because we are dealing with figures and complex issues of science.  The bare reality of the dishonesty becomes clearer by the day.There are other issues in the environment area again showing a lack of ambition or vision.  When I read in the Sunday papers that there would be a green budget I thought to myself it would be interesting.  I was slightly apprehensive of the Government parties taking some of our agenda.

It shows a lack of ambition and vision, and it is indicative of a Government that is not wise to where we need to go as a country.  Instead it is looking backwards at how well we the people have done in bringing all this economic prosperity.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	481	This Government has been in power for nearly a decade and must be judged at election time, not on this budget alone but also on all its previous failures to eradicate poverty in this State.  In a period of unprecedented economic growth, the Government has failed miserably to redistribute the State's wealth to all those who helped generate it and who need it most.I watched in disgust yesterday as Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies cheered the Minister for Finance and patted themselves on the back, giving the impression that in this extremely wealthy state in which there is no poverty.  I listened to the Tánaiste give us a lesson on the Constitution earlier this afternoon, reminding us there is a constitutional obligation on the State to provide for the disadvantaged in Irish society.  One hopes that he will one day take a break from his rhetorical pontificating to set about discharging this obligation.The reality is this Government continues to reward higher earners and widen the gap between the hundreds of thousands of Irish workers who produce the wealth of this economy and the thousands who profit from it.  The headline in this morning's edition of The
Irish Times accurately sums it up — “Highest Earners Biggest Winners”.  A flurry of social welfare increases, which in the context of such a massive surplus cannot be described as anything other than minimalist, is not enough and many major issues were ignored completely.There was nothing in the budget to deal with food poverty, for example.  In 2004 Combat Poverty, Crosscare and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul published a report entitled Food Poverty and Policy, the findings of which suggest food poverty is a real and significant issue for low-income households.  Based on 2003 data, up to 10% of the population in this State, 375,000 people, can be considered at risk of food poverty.  This increases to 15% of children, 125,000 of the most vulnerable people in our society.  There was no mention of increased funding for meals on wheels, despite the findings of recent research that almost one in five older people admitted to hospital are undernourished.Another area ignored by this budget was the plight of some of our newest arrivals to Ireland.  I am particularly disappointed the budget did not abolish the habitual residency requirement for child benefit.  The poverty experienced by the low-paid migrant workers who are increasingly crucial to this economy, as well as refugee families, has been exacerbated by the introduction in May 2004 of the habitual residency conditions which deny child benefit payments to newly-arrived asylum seekers.  The requirement is a disgrace.  While higher-income families get child benefit, some of those who most need it are prevented from getting it.Refugee families were noticeable by their absence from the budget yesterday.  Asylum seekers are forced to depend entirely on the direct provision system, which is hostel accommodation, full board and a weekly payment of €19.10 for adults and €9.60 for children.  Most galling of all for those people in receipt of direct provision is that they are willing to work but are not permitted to do so.  Many are educated or skilled people forced to leave their home countries, yet the Government insists on seeing them as an unpalatable burden, to be thrown a few coppers and kept in hostels instead of allowing them to work and contribute to this society while a determination is made on their case. This discriminatory system has been described as leading to physical, economic and psychological marginalisation of refugee families.  It results in these families experiencing poverty and having to cope with difficulties clothing and feeding themselves and their children.Earlier, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, spoke eloquently about how much this budget delivered for carers reminding the Opposition, when I suggest it is the Government which needs reminding, of the importance of carers to Irish society.  While the increase in carer's allowance and the respite care grant must be welcomed, the reality is that full-time carers who do not receive the carer's allowance due to the means test are no better off today than they were before the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stood up.  Ireland's carers, who provide 3.5 million unpaid hours of care every week and contribute more than €2.1 billion to the social economy, have campaigned for an end to the means test for years.  They were left bitterly disappointed again by this Government.

Just think what could be done for those pensioners living in poverty if the will existed.  The money frittered away on pension tax breaks which disproportionately benefit the wealthy, and amounted to €2.75 billion in 2002, could be redirected into the provision of a basic State pension for all.  A basic State pension system would also deliver equality for women, who are badly serviced by the present system.

It would have been surprising and appalling had it not done so.  The Government can boast about nothing in this increase.  During the next two months any non-contributory pensioner living in local authority housing will receive an increase from the local authorities in his or her weekly payment.

That is the cost of the four pints the Minister of State might drink tonight.  The increase is lost in inflation and increases in rent and fuel costs.The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated today the Government plays its part in tackling climate change.  It was a frightening thing to state. If this is the Government playing its part, I would hate to see what it would look like if it sat on its hands.  This State faces penalties of €120 million per annum because of the failure to achieve our Kyoto targets.  Yet the Government's main environmental proposal in this budget and the solution to the monumental problem of climate change proposed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is to spend €270 million buying carbon allowances.  He seeks to buy the right to generate more pollution for Irish industry.  The industrialised north will buy its way out of its commitments to reduce emissions and the expense will be passed on to the consumer.  This is a form of environmental imperialism.

A recently published analysis of carbon trading, Carbon Trading: A Critical Conversation on Climate Change, Privatisation and Power, argues that carbon trading slows the social and technological change needed to cope with global warming by unnecessarily prolonging the world's dependence on oil, coal and gas.

This Government is determined to hand our oil and gas rights over to multinational corporations such as in the Corrib gas field.The increase in grants for growing energy crops is welcome.  It was proposed by Sinn Féin and others four years ago as a means to attract more farmers to this area.  We are disappointed at the small size and limited vision of the proposals on bio-energy crop production.  It is a missed opportunity.If the political will existed, the closure of the sugar factories in Mallow and Carlow was an ideal opportunity to divert to biofuel production.  Despite this golden opportunity, the Government's attitude is to adopt a hands-off approach, ignoring the possibility of the State becoming not just a producer of ethanol based bio-fuels but, given time, a net exporter of a valuable source of energy.  It is another missed opportunity in a budget of missed opportunities from a Government which will be remembered by future generations as having had the resources to end poverty in Ireland and build a more equal and sustainable society and failing to do so.  This budget creates the perception of being a good budget.  The reality in most cases is quite different.  Higher earners are the bigger winners.  That is what this budget is about.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	492	As I read and listened to the Budget Statement yesterday I waited to see where the vision was.  The budget was about making sure everybody got a little bit of something but no particular group requiring attention received a big gain.  Some matters were incredibly disappointing, including child care which was one of the key features of last year's budget.  We were told a great deal of catching up had to be done and that it needed to be done over a number of budgets.  An expectation existed that this budget would contain something but sadly it was a disappointment in that respect.The Minister for Finance gave an election commitment to reduce the top rate of tax to 40% should the Government be returned to power next year.  No similar commitment was given on child care.  The Government was caught off guard by the strength of feeling on this issue in the by-elections in Meath and Kildare North in 2005.  I expect it to be a dominant issue in many other constituencies, including the two I mentioned, when the general election is called.  Nothing is more sobering than knocking on a few thousand doors and hearing the same issue constantly arising.  Opinion polls rapidly go out the window when one meets real people with real concerns.People tell me the amount they pay for child care is the same as a second mortgage.  Try and take that on board given the type of mortgages people have at present.  It does not seem to be a problem for people to take on board the necessity of mortgage relief.  However, the same level of concern does not exist for two people in a household who must work because house prices are so high, or for a single parent who works and must pay child care.  This major issue required courage which I am afraid was sadly lacking.  The issue is not confined to children under the age of five.  Often, children over the age of six must be dropped off to a child minder at 7 a.m. and collected in the evening.  The parents who pay are those who work and drive the economy.I was extremely critical of the €10,000 tax exemption for child minders which was substantially below the minimum wage.  Those who mind up to three children in their own homes do not have holiday pay or worker protection.  The amount of €10,000 was a downright insult.  Although the increase to €15,000 will not produce a stampede, it is welcome.Pre-school is the research and development ground of the educational system but we saw nothing on it, which is disappointing.  I welcome the increase in paid maternity leave.  Many cannot afford to take the unpaid element.  Child care places for babies are particularly expensive and some child care providers will not accept babies under one year old because of the ratio of staff to children and the expense involved.  This is becoming a serious problem.There were some very interesting proposals from the National Children's Nurseries Association, which carried out a very good survey on this issue which discussed issues like VAT and commercial rates.  These are serious areas to examine in terms of dealing with the cost of child care.  The association also sought a reassessment of the capital allowance scheme.  Simply increasing the supply of child care facilities does not address the affordability of child care.  There is much that can be done in the community and voluntary sector in this respect which would not be expensive.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 could be used in this respect.  A considerable amount that is not hugely expensive can be done, but there was little or no imagination in the budget in this respect.The second element of the budget on which I wish to focus is the disgraceful way of dealing with commitments under the Kyoto Agreement.  A total of €270 million has been committed up to 2012, which is basically investment in other countries.  There was a line in the budget about keeping Ireland green, which is the biggest joke ever.  Instead of investing in things like buses and dealing with the transportation sector, which is one of the biggest areas where our commitments are not being met, we are investing in Second and Third World economies to buy our way out.  It is a cheap way and we can do much better than that.  We have a particular genius for building infrastructure in half the countries in the world, yet we cannot deal with something like our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.  This is hugely disappointing and we can do much better.  This area needs to be revisited.  I do not know what kind of example is being set for ordinary householders when one asks them to separate waste and modify their behaviour when the Government is showing that we can buy our way out.  Imperialism is the right terminology to use in this respect.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently announced that he intended to introduce new measures to improve value for money relating to local authority budgets of €9 billion.  The fact there will be some control over these extensive budgets is very welcome.  Critical services are provided by local authorities, however, a €4.5 billion capital and current debt has been accumulated by them.  This information was contained in a reply to a parliamentary question last week.  It is not just a question of looking at budget controls; it involves looking at the ability of local authorities to provide services.The issue of value for money must be taken on board by the Government.  There is a considerable amount of outsourcing of Government, whether it is the HSE or a huge number of organisations.  It is only at times when the Government runs into financial difficulty that these matters get the attention they require.  If there had been a serious examination of the waste currently taking place, there would have been considerably more money to spend on areas like carers and extending limits, disability services and child care.  The funding announced in the budget in respect of the Disability Act 2005 only covers a very important commitment that relates to children under the age of five.  All it provides for is an assessment when we know there is a critical shortage of some of the services required to address issues identified in this assessment.The final area on which I will focus is waste.  I know there will be an announcement in respect of money that is being spent in the health services.  We were told a few years ago that the problem with the health boards resulted from local public representatives being members of them.  When these representatives were taken off the health boards, the problem got significantly worse.  One cannot even get an intelligible reply from the HSE.  While I have regard for individuals who work in the HSE, we have a serious problem with that organisation which we must address.  It is not a question of just throwing money at the health care issue.  It is a question of understanding what kind of return we are going to get from this.  We are doing very poorly in this regard.  Health is one of the most inequitable services in the country.  One sees wide variations in the quality of services provided, depending on the part of the country in which one lives.  Areas that have experienced rapid population growth are some of the worst areas in terms of waiting lists and difficulties.  It is only a matter of time before there is a serious debate on and a vote of no confidence in that organisation, such is the reaction from people who interact with it.

The overall budget for these areas is €698.6 million for 2007, an increase of 17.6% over 2006.  This includes €216.56 million for arts and culture, an increase of 8.65% over 2006; €316.87 million for sport, an increase of 30% on 2006; and €153.7 million for tourism, an increase of 9% on 2006.  The total capital allocation for 2007 is €298.842 million, an increase of just over 32% on 2006.  The total current allocation for 2007 is over €399.759 million, an increase of 8.6% on 2006.  It is important to view these increases in the context of exceptional growth in recent years in these areas.  The arts, sport and tourism sectors have received unprecedented tangible support from the Government in terms of significantly increased financial allocations.No one can doubt the Government's commitment to the arts.  The Arts Council is the main vehicle through which the State supports the arts.  The Government's ongoing commitment to the arts sector is demonstrated with an allocation of €80 million to the Arts Council in 2007.  I am also very pleased the Government has again been able to provide a substantial increase for the national cultural institutions.Overall funding of €19.7 million will be allocated to the Irish Film Board in 2007.  This increase will enable the board to continue with its essential role in developing and supporting indigenous Irish industry.  The increased current allocation will facilitate the board in marketing Ireland as a film location and, in particular, will assist the work of the newly appointed official in Los Angeles in raising the profile of the Irish audiovisual industry abroad.I am also delighted that a 50% increase in funding has been secured for Culture Ireland to ensure Irish art is promoted at home and abroad.  Taken together with the 50% increase secured in 2006, this represents unprecedented Government support for the arts.This year's budget provides further evidence of the Government's commitment to providing practical support for sporting bodies seeking to develop their facilities.  These bodies already benefit from specific income tax and capital gains tax exemptions and can all look forward to benefiting from an exemption from stamp duty on lands purchased for the purpose of promoting sports, to be provided for under the Finance Bill 2007.  This will complement the support provided under my Department's annual sports capital programme for the provision of improved sporting facilities at local, regional and national level.I am delighted the Minister has included additional funding of €2 million in the 2007 budget for Special Olympics Ireland.  The Government holds the Special Olympics organisation in high regard and this is recognised by its commitment to funding.  The programmes implemented by the organisation for people with intellectual disabilities have a profound and positive impact on families and communities.  The organisation now has 11,000 affiliated members in 402 clubs countrywide, with a network of 101 communities supporting these clubs.  The additional funding of €2 million provided in this year's budget will help Special Olympics Ireland to meet its extensive financial commitments next year, with the world games being held in Shanghai where some 200 athletes and coaches will represent Ireland.  These measures should be placed in the context of the highest ever budget for sport, which is €316.87 million.  If one compares this with the amount spent when sport became an issue at the Cabinet table in 1997, namely €17 million, one will note there has been an unprecedented increase.  The allocation will enable us to press ahead with our ambitious plans to transform sports infrastructure, including the delivery of two major projects that are vital to our national sports profile.The Government has made a considerable effort to bring our sports infrastructure into line with best international standards.  This includes the provision of €87.8 million towards improving sports infrastructure at local and regional levels, €76 towards the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road, €30 million towards the development of phase 1 of the sports campus at Abbotstown and over €71 million for the horse and greyhound industries.The 2007 budget for the Irish Sports Council has been increased from €40.9 million to €49.025 million, which is an increase of 20%.  This increase will help to ensure the council can continue to deliver its various programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation by people of all ages in healthy sport and physical recreation, and at raising standards in competitive and elite sport.The major issue facing Irish tourism is competitiveness.  Budget 2007, with its emphasis on sustaining order in the public finances, minimising inflation, reducing income tax and avoiding increases in indirect taxes and excise duties on food, drink, accommodation and petrol will support the tourism industry in delivering value for money and withstanding international competition.The decision in budget 2007 to allow for the deduction of VAT on certain expenses incurred in attending business conferences will give a major boost to Ireland's position as an attractive international destination for business tourism.  I warmly welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance that he intends to provide for the removal of the block on recoupment of VAT on certain conference-related expenses in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  Ireland is one of the few EU countries at the higher end of the VAT scale that does not provide for deductibility.  This has been eroding Ireland's competitive position in attracting conference-related business.I strongly pursued the issue of VAT deductibility with the Minister for Finance in recent months.  It was one of the key budget proposals sought by the major tourism representative bodies, including the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation.  It has also been supported by the business tourism forum established by Fáilte Ireland and the tourism strategy implementation group.The international conference market is very lucrative — it is estimated to be worth approximately €40 billion annually.  Although we have made some advances in recent years, there is great potential for Ireland to grow its share in this market in line with our overall dramatic progress in tourism generally.  Yesterday's decision, together with the imminent decision by the Government, which it is hoped will give the go-ahead for the construction of a national conference centre in Dublin, should position Ireland at the top end of the international conference market.The increase in the VAT exemption limit for small service businesses from €27,500 to €35,000 will benefit small accommodation providers, including bed and breakfast owners, who have been under some pressure in recent years due to changes in lifestyle and consumer taste.  This increase is further evidence of a listening Minister for Finance who understands Irish business.For 2007, I have secured a record amount of Exchequer resources for tourism services.  The sum amounts to €154 million, which represents an increase of 9% on this year's allocation.  This includes an increase of 13% in the tourism marketing fund, which amounts to €45 million.  It will enable the tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, to deliver ambitious marketing and development plans.The budget has come at the end of a good year for tourism.  Conference numbers are rising, the number of overseas visitors in the first nine months of the year has increased by 11% and the number of holidaymakers is growing.  We are gaining market share in global and European terms and the domestic tourism business is strong as Irish people take an increasing number of short breaks, many of which are spent in the country.Over the past four and a half years, the Government has put in place a programme of total reform in respect of tourism.  It has embraced the reform of all our tourism agencies, both national and regional, and of all our major tourism strategies in the fields of marketing, product development and human resources.  This programme of reform is now paying dividends.Tourism is no longer the Cinderella of Irish industry.  It comprises our largest internationally trading indigenous service industry.  Last year it was worth in excess of €4.2 billion in foreign revenue and in excess of €1.5 billion in domestic revenue.  This year, 2006, has been one of the best ever for overseas visits to Ireland and I look forward to even better developments in the years ahead.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his very prudent and good budget, which covers the full spectrum of society.  I compliment him on the way money is allocated to the various Departments for spending.  As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I congratulate him on the amount he allocated to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, whom I congratulate on what has rightly been described as the best social welfare budget in the history of the State.  The budget has used the country's economic success not to make the rich richer, as has been said, but as a targeted and focused approach to help the less well-off in society.The Minister has brought the pensions debate to the forefront of Government policy.  In this regard, the budget aims to assist in three very important areas: it outstrips the Government's commitment to increase the old age pension to €200, it improves the lot of those who have generated the prosperity the country now enjoys and it has initiated a process to give women greater pension entitlements.The budget makes great strides in giving more support to carers, who have, through their compassion and dedication, supported society by caring for those in need of constant attention.  Widows who were previously unable to work as carers in their communities because they stood to lose their non-contributory pensions received good news through the budget yesterday in that they can now do so.  This will mean a lot to widows in Mayo and elsewhere who wanted to serve their communities by looking after their neighbours but who were unable to do so because they stood to lose their main source of income.The Minister for Finance confirmed today that, from September 2007 a new payment, equivalent to half the carer's allowance, will be provided for certain people receiving another social welfare entitlement.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs will ensure that it will be allocated in an equitable way.  For the first time, widows who wish to work in their communities as carers will be able to receive more than one social welfare entitlement.  The Government has committed €31.15 million for 2007 and €75.62 million thereafter.  This represents a good investment in communities and I welcome it wholeheartedly.It was announced in the Budget Statement that respite care grants will be increased by €300 to €1,500 from June 2007.  This is also welcome.  I welcome it in particular because carers deserve to receive a respite grant given the difficult task they have been doing over the years.The budget has prioritised addressing the scandal of child poverty and has introduced a package to provide more income and supports, such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which will contribute to helping children take their place in society and build an even better Ireland in the future.  The budget will revolutionise social policy.  It has set out a framework and strategy by which we can wipe out poverty completely once and for all and make the country one of the greatest nations in the world.I compliment the Minister for Finance on two initiatives, both of which affect my constituency.  He has allocated €1 million for addiction services.  Hope House in Foxford will benefit, in addition to two other organisations.  Hope House does tremendous work for those with drug and alcohol problems and I thank the Minister sincerely for allocating money to it.The No Name Club will share a package worth €1.5 million.  I am delighted money has been allocated to it because it runs alcohol-free clubs for young people between 15 and 17 years.  I compliment the people in my town, Claremorris, on the work they do with people of that age to keep them out of trouble.  The response from the young people is tremendous.  I thank the Minister for Finance for announcing those measures in the budget.Small business received a major boost in the budget.  In County Mayo there are many small indigenous companies that have worked hard over recent years to build their businesses and they do extremely well at providing employment for many people.  The measures the Minister introduced in the budget will help them to work more smartly, pursue excellence and invest in innovation and creativity.The 250,000 small businesses in the country are a major source of employment and growth, employing almost 800,000 people, or four out of every ten workers.  It is vital that the Government does everything it can to help them, and budget 2007 does so.  I compliment the Minister for Finance on recognising that and bringing in different parts of this scheme to benefit small businesses.  I congratulate him on a prudent budget that will have far-reaching effects.  I have no doubt that the next budget he presents will be even better.

Since 1997, a deliberate and focused strategy has underpinned this Government's budget policy.  This has resulted in record economic growth, a doubling of the number of people at work to over 2 million, fundamental tax reform, redistribution of wealth, major increases in social services and a massive programme of investment in infrastructure.As the Taoiseach said here this morning, we live in an astonishing period of national development.  We have succeeded in delivering an Ireland which is closer than ever to the one of which our forefathers dreamed.  It is not a perfect republic, but under this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, Ireland is a better country to live in than ever before.Over these ten budgets, a clear and focused strategy has been followed, which has made our modern republic one that is looked up to all over the world.  This has all the more significance because not so long ago the opposite was the case.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I am continually struck by the extraordinary journey which our country has travelled.  Fewer than two decades ago, it was one of the Cinderellas of the EU.  Today it is at the top of the 25 member states and as traditionally powerful states, such as France and Germany experience sluggish economic growth, Ireland continues to drive forward.For the new member states, and for those about to accede to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Ireland is a perfect role model which they seek to emulate.  This budget is a generous, responsible and focused set of provisions, which will sustain economic progress while improving the quality of life for all our people.  Underlying all that this Government does is a genuine desire to spread our continuing prosperity as evenly as possible, and to ensure that policies of fairness and equality are always pursued.This is one of the fairest and most socially progressive budgets ever produced by an Irish Government.  We have generated the means, through prudent economic management and now we are setting about using it.  Previous speakers have already outlined the extraordinary array of benefits across almost every area of public policy which this Government has initiated in this last budget of the 29th Dáil.This budget rewards workers, promotes enterprise and protects the vulnerable, such as older people, those on welfare and people with disabilities.  It also gives a real boost to first time home buyers with a doubling of mortgage interest relief, and further increases in child care benefit and funding for child care places, for hard-pressed working families.In this budget the Government has given back more money to the people than ever before.  It has been in a position to do this, because of its sound management of our economy, over the past nine years, which has allowed the largest ever increases in public spending and cuts in taxes.  The Opposition is battling valiantly to pick holes in budget 2007.  It is a hard station in which it has become very well practised.  It knows in its heart that there is good news for everyone in this budget and that the vulnerable in our society have been especially well catered for.It knows that the word on the streets about this budget is very positive and that the people are in no mood to risk their future economic and social management with any other than a Fianna Fáil-led Administration.  It is my pleasure to commend this wonderful budget to the House and I salute Deputy Cowen on the outstanding leadership he has given, the work he has done and the excellent support he has received from his Government colleagues, led by an outstanding Taoiseach on behalf of the people.

This budget is responsible and sustainable and addresses the essential strategies required to ensure competitiveness.  I am pleased that it addresses the regulatory and administrative burdens that posed a major problem for people in the small business sector.  Some significant improvements have been made in that area.The budget puts in place strategies that ensure our competitiveness.  This year the extension and enhancement of the business expansion and seed capital schemes will cost €25 million in a full year and will contribute to developments in these areas.  These schemes are a vital source of seed capital which is the lifeblood of start-up companies.  They foster the development and growth of many small and medium sized enterprises, leading to the creation of quality employment opportunities.There are also changes in the VAT registration threshold and corporation tax liability which will reduce the administrative and regulatory burden on the small business sector.  The Government recognises the importance of research and development, and the enhancement of the research and development tax credit, estimated to cost €70 million a year, will further incentivise companies to engage in research and development.  It will also encourage foreign direct investors to consider Ireland a good location for their research and development facilities and activities.  The Government has invested quite significantly in this area in recent years although historically we had not grappled with it successfully.  The emphasis for many years was on encouraging foreign direct investment and its attendant jobs which was welcome and successful.  A total of 93,000 jobs are in foreign direct investment companies.It is important for the future, however, that we have an indigenous research and development sector, all the more so if we can achieve it at multi-national level.  They are increasingly showing a willingness to base some of their key research and development facilities here.  The tie-up with third level institutions has been of critical importance in this area.  Some previous speakers said that has not been as effective as it might be but the lead-in period from research and development is quite long and the benefits will be reaped between three and five years from now, or even further into the future, when Ireland's credibility as a location for research and development is properly established.  That is a strategy we need to pursue if we are to be successful in this area.As Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs I am pleased that the changes in income tax will remove some 88,000 people from the tax net and help those who are unemployed to transfer to the active labour market.  In a short period we have moved from having just under 1.1 million people in employment to just over 2 million.That is the most dramatic increase in the workforce among our OECD partners.  A critical factor in that achievement is the low level of tax on income.  Ireland enjoys the second lowest tax wedge of all OECD countries.  In this budget the increased credits, the widened bands and the rate cut to 41% will contribute to ensuring that we continue to move in that direction.  Historically, we have learned that widened bands and much increased credits contribute substantially and much more dramatically to reducing the tax burden on workers to ensure that work pays.  That is one of the critical strategies we need to embrace as we progress.I am pleased the Minister guaranteed that if the national minimum wage is raised to the level recommended by the Labour Court, it too will remain outside the tax net, which is important for people working at that level.  One of the claims made against the economy is that it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.  I was pleased to hear the results from the Irish Taxation Institute earlier which indicated that the benefits from the budget for the top 20% of earners averaged 2.5% while the benefits for the bottom 20% of earners was 9.5% on average.  This confirms that the budget is strongly skewed in favour of those on lower incomes which is important in terms of ensuring parity across the workforce.Interestingly, a recent European study showed that the top 20% of wealth owners in this country have just under five times as much wealth as those in the bottom 20%.  The European average is 4.8%.  We are moving quickly towards that point.  Ten years ago, the top 20% were more than 5.2 times as wealthy as the bottom 20%.  The difference is gradually being reduced and is coming close to the European average.  This runs counter to what one would believe on reading commentary in this area which invariably suggests that wealth is gradually being repositioned in favour of those in the top 20%.  That allegation is not borne out by recent research.  The effect of the budget will be positive in this regard.One of the areas to which people look in assessing a budget is that of social welfare payments.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has a budget of over €15.3 billion.  I cannot remember how much it was when Deputy Durkan was a Minister of State in that Department.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	503	In any event, it has enabled the Minister on this occasion to deliver on pension commitments many people said five years ago could not be delivered in ten years, let alone five years.  That is something about which we are very pleased.  It acknowledges the tremendous work done by old age pensioners both currently and historically.As Deputy Carty stated, there is improved provision for carers, which is to be welcomed also.  This enables some people who were debarred in a rather unfair manner to benefit from payments in that area.  The respite care grant, which is important, has been dramatically improved also.  People on the lowest rate of social welfare will receive an additional €20 per week.  This is a significant increase.  There has been a fivefold increase in the Department's Vote in ten years.One of the most welcome measures, to which few speakers have referred, is the improvements in preventing child poverty.  That is one of the areas where we need to continue to direct resources.  One could be forgiven for thinking that just increasing payments is sufficient to address issues relating to child poverty, but a much wider provision is necessary in that area to support families.  While the payments announced in the budget are of considerable importance, there are other critical areas of support for families to ensure that children are moved out of poverty and benefit from the wealth of the State.  It is a hugely challenging area because it involves providing facilities to ensure people have real access to food, education, etc.The provision of child care is also critical in terms of enabling women, in particular, to be active members of the workforce.  There have been significant increases in the number of women participating in the workforce in the past two years.  Some of them may have been among the ranks of the unemployed but many were from the inactive element of the population who were previously not encouraged to work outside the home.  They have made a contribution to the quality and flexibility of the workforce and its capacity to deliver.  One of the critical factors in enabling lone parents and mothers generally to go to work is the provision of affordable child care.  That is one of the areas which was non-existent previously.One of the resources which could be more significant arises from the tax credit provided to those who provide childminding services in their homes.  On this occasion the Minister has increased that by 50%.  I have no doubt this will impact on the number of child care places available and the corresponding increase in child care places will have a substantial impact on the affordability of child care, which is a considerable obstacle to some people who wish to participate in the workforce.Another area of concern prior to the budget was first-time buyers and the difficulty experienced by young people getting on the property ladder.  The budget increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers is significant and will impact favourably on the capacity of young people to acquire their own homes.  We have a tradition of home ownership that appears to be deeply ingrained.  It is to the benefit of society as a whole that this is the case.  The budget acknowledges and makes provision for this and will help to get people on that important first rung of the ladder.The fact that the measure is backdated for up to seven years is also an acknowledgement that some people have managed to get their feet on the property ladder, despite the difficulties we are led to believe have existed in that area.  In some parts of the country these difficulties were not all due to the economy or the rise in house prices.  I refer to matters such as planning permission and other ancillary issues which have been negative in their impact on affordability, especially in rural areas.  That may not be something which can be addressed by the budget but does need to be examined generally.A number of measures are designed to assist farmers.  Tax relief on stamp duty, capital gains tax and the leasing income arrangements are all much improved.  The farmers' flat rate of VAT has been increased to 5.2%, which is worth an extra €16 million for farmers.  Perhaps, more importantly, will be the introduction of REPS 4 which will come into effect during the year.  I believe it will have two important impacts.  It will clearly improve environmental matters and assist farmers to ensure the environment is protected and enhanced to the best extent possible.  It will also have a significant impact on farmers' incomes.  That will help to make them more sustainable.  A number of issues arise in that regard, not least that of crops in terms of fossil fuels, etc, which are addressed in this budget and which are becoming more of a challenge not just for this country, but for all of western Europe and much of the developed world.  The Minister has made considerable advancements in this area in the previous two budgets and it will undoubtedly be of future benefit.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I was intrigued when Deputy O'Connor referred to the fact that he has never seen the Opposition give a standing ovation to the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps we are not so emotional.  I will agree that there was a general upswelling of emotion which resulted in what can only be regarded as an orgy of emotion when the Minister finished his speech last evening.  That can only be compared to a scene from the film, "The Italian Job", which Members will recall.The mastermind in the film was played by Noël Coward, who organised a heist from prison.  When word got back to him that the job had been pulled off and the thieves were speeding away with the loot through the various escape roads in a mountainous area of Italy, there was a celebration back in the prison.  Noël Coward descended slowly from the top of the staircase to the ground floor to the tumultuous applause of everybody.  He got a standing ovation.  Considering the film further, one recalls that the getaway truck was at this point perched precariously over the side of a precipice with the golden loot slipping around as it see-sawed back and forth.  In the middle of it all, Michael Caine said "Hang on a moment, I've got a plan".  There is a certain similarity between "The Italian Job" and what we have seen in the past 24 hours.While I am on the issue of applause at budget time, I remind the Members opposite that on an occasion not so long ago, my poor old friend and colleague, former Deputy McCreevy, presented a budget in which he made a famous announcement on decentralisation.  There was loud and prolonged applause from the audience on the other side of the House who rose to their feet and stomped and pawed the ground, but when the mountain laboured, it brought forth the usual mouse.  I hope Members on the other side of the House do not lose the run of themselves but instead evaluate the budget in the proper way.The first question which comes to mind is prompted by an inimitable Member opposite who said the budget was all give and no take.  We must ask why it was all give.  The answer, simply, is that what should have been given before was not.  A quick look at the various groups in our society provides an adequate explanation as to why there was so much money in the coffers.  If one considers the much vaunted housing situation, one finds there are still between 50,000 and 60,000 families on housing lists.  Supplementary welfare is being paid to appease them because they cannot be housed.  The problem could have been solved simply by spending money to build houses specifically for them, as used to be done once upon a time.  That has not been done, however.  Hospital waiting lists are another explanation for the amount of money which has been saved up.  There is a lack of adequate health and psychiatric services, including child psychiatric services, and long waiting lists for services of every hue.  The lists have been growing for the last ten years, but they have not been attended to.  If one wants to know how the Government has so much money to spend, examining how much it should have spent already on health services will give one food for thought.In the education sector, one must ask how many schools are dilapidated or in need of extension.  How many new schools are required and how long have we been waiting for action?  How long have we been waiting for a reduction in class sizes while we continue to have one of the worst pupil-teacher ratios in the world?  Why in five years has no one on the Government benches risen up in rebellion to demand that education be made a priority?  Nothing has been done.  A mother came to see me last Saturday whose child needs speech and language therapy.  Her child was diagnosed two years ago, but there is still no sign of treatment, nor will there be in the next 12 months.  They may have to wait a further two years.  Early detection and treatment is important if a child is not to lag behind in his or her academic progress in later years.  The failure to provide the services that child needs is another reason money has been saved up to be given away in a blatant attempt to buy votes in the next general election.The people are alert to the Government's tactic.  They might have bought it a few years ago as they bought the famous gimmick in 1977 when the motto was "Put more money in people's pockets", despite the fact that Europe had just emerged from an oil crisis.  The Opposition of the day, whose party now sits on the Government side, decided it would go all out and abolished car tax.  The result was potholes and plenty of them.  The entire local government finance system and national road network were ruined, but as if that did not suffice, Fianna Fáil decided also that it would abolish rates.  Why not go the whole hog and abolish everything?  The result was more broken down services and a local authority system which could not meet its payments.  After four very difficult years for the people of this country who had been told there was a better way and that more money in people's pockets would be the order of the day, the incoming Government elected in June 1981 had to produce a supplementary budget within 28 days of taking office.  There was no money to pay civil servants, teachers or Garda or Army wages.  When I hear the Members opposite crowing about how well they have done in the last couple of years and taking credit for addressing the economy, I have to smile.For my sins, I spent a great deal of time as a member of the Committee on European Affairs where my attention was caught in the early days by the Common Fisheries Policy and its likely effect on Ireland.  When I joined the committee, we had a fairly healthy fishing industry.  It may do no good to say that various domestic interests undermined the industry to the extent that it has almost disappeared, but the fact is that we no longer have a coastal fishing sector.  It has almost completely closed down.  One can travel around the coast from Killybegs to Carlingford and find that it is closing.  In a few years, we will no longer be able to get the famous Irish delicacy smoked salmon as we used to know it, which will be a terrible thing for the socialists on the Government side.  We can blame who we like, but the people on the other side of the House were part and parcel of the negotiations at European level which allowed this to happen.  The Common Fisheries Policy was a matter for them.  It is no good to say that stocks are down when the question is why that has happened.Reference has been made in this debate to agriculture.  Among the claims which emerged from the last reform of the CAP was that there was great hope for Irish agriculture, but when I heard the phrase "rural development programme", I knew we were coming to the end.  The reality for agriculture, on which the Members opposite have been negotiating for years, in Ireland and in Europe is that we will increasingly import food into a food producing country.  We will import our food from Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Latin America, which will do a great deal for the ozone layer and carbon emissions.  We will not produce food here because it will not be profitable.  The sugar beet industry provides the classic example of how something can be allowed to slip away.  How totally negligent the Government was to allow that to happen while at the same time other countries in Europe were considering how to convert the industry to produce something else that is now required, such as bio-fuels.  An agreement was reached on the compensatory package, a huge amount of which went to the food processing company involved.  It will move out of the country at the first opportunity and sell off the property assets it has here, which it got from the State, from the Irish Sugar Company.  If producers continued to produce sugar, they would get no compensation, which is extraordinary.There are two food producing areas that are critical to this country which has a climate eminently suited to food production.  It is amazing that we should let them be negotiated away from us in the context of CAP reform, which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, mentioned in a laudatory fashion of his efforts to the effect that CAP reform was very beneficial to the environment.  I am sure the Minister of State sitting opposite is saying to himself "What the hell did he do that for?"  I presume he thought fewer animals would mean less methane gas generation from the national herd, which would be beneficial to the ozone layer and the reduction in carbon emissions.  I ask somebody to do the calculations when compared with the carbon emissions from all the imports that will be needed as a result.  That applies not only to this country but also to the rest of Europe.  However, the sugar beet industry in France has not disappeared.  Miraculously it kept it on board.  In parts of Britain it has also been retained because those countries are wise.  Our negotiators did not do such a great job there.The supply of health services is an emotive issue.  People need to get treatment when it is required.  There is no sense in promising treatment in a year or even six months.  There may not be time to wait.  It may be necessary and urgent that the treatment be provided now.  During the stewardship of the Government 35,000 extra employees have been brought into the delivery of health services.  While I do not know whose idea that was, it took place immediately after the former Minister for Health and Children said that he had identified a problem with the health boards which were wasting the money.  We now have a single health board for the entire country which cannot and will not work, as Members opposite who were members of local authorities will know.  It is impossible to administer on the ground to an area that is as widely dispersed as our health board area now is from Donegal to Kerry to Wexford and up again to Carlingford.  I suppose that on examination at some future time it will mend its ways.  That is why Deputy Ned O'Keeffe said it was all give — everything had been taken beforehand.I wish to discuss the communications area of my portfolio.  If as much money was floating around the country as is professed, why, in God's name, was nothing done to keep us at the leading edge of modern telecommunications and technology?  We were either first or second in the European league.  We are now either second last or last in a bigger group in the European league.  While that took considerable imagination, effort and neglect, we have arrived at that point regardless of whether we like it.  Sadly when we are trying to attract business and industry to the country and when we are trying to pretend we are at the leading edge in technology, we have allowed this to happen.  Needless to say we had our flirtation with electronic voting.  While I know the population has increased, I did not think it had increased by so much that we could no longer count the people's votes manually at election time.  The Government decided to get rid of almost €60 million in the daftest idea I have ever heard.  Anybody who spends time in this House could think of many other ways in which the money could be used.I wish to mention what was the subject matter of the Private Members' debate this week.  During the same term of stewardship, we have seen the demise of at least 500 post offices which were the backbone of the postal service network and which provided more ancillary services to the local rural and urban communities than anyone has yet assessed.  Sadly the Government had originally intended to allow the postal services to wither on the vine and perhaps we would have replaced them with something else.  There will be a change of Government some time and we will address that issue.The energy area is also in the portfolio for which I am responsible.  Amazing things have happened in this area which are amusing.  To contradict everybody else in the world we decided to increase gas and electricity prices in the past six months.  All the indicators were that it should have gone in the opposite direction and there was absolute silence from Government while the Opposition raised questions.  We could not raise questions in the House because it was a matter exclusively for the regulator.  Lo and behold, when the Minister went to Hanoi he must have spoken on a tannoy because it was reported that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, had recently met the chairmen and chief executives of both the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann when the proposed tariff increases were announced by the regulator, and that he had urged both to review the need for the increases being proposed and to explore ways of minimising them in the interests of the consumers.

Both companies indicated a willingness to do so subject to the regulatory system.  Lo and behold, despite all the regulation and all the obstacles in their way, it came to pass that it was possible to reduce the increase that had already been granted.  Between them, they attempted to pull off the greatest con of all time.  The increase now appears to have been a decrease.  I know there is considerable confusion on the matter on the opposite side of the House.  The difference is as follows.  The Minister should go back to the various executives to whom he spoke before and ask them to restore the prices that prevailed before the original increase was granted.  There was no basis or grounds for an increase and that is still the case.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the report into the death by suicide of Ms Anne Carroll on 17 October 2004 at Cork University Hospital.  I wish to express my sympathy to the Carroll family in respect of this tragedy and the suffering it caused.  Our objective is to ensure similar tragedies do not take place and that the recommendations contained in the report are introduced as a matter of urgency.A report into the death of Anne Carroll was submitted to the Inspector of Mental Health Services on 18 November 2004 by Dr. Eamon Moloney, clinical director, south Lee mental health services.  Ms Carroll had a history of mental health problems since the late 1970s and had been admitted on a number of occasions to inpatient psychiatric care.  She was diagnosed as having bipolar defective disorder and, following an overdose of 200 tablets one week previously at home, was transferred to the GF unit from the intensive care unit at Cork University Hospital on 6 September 2004.  However, on 17 October 2004 she returned early from her weekend leave to the GF unit and complained of feeling depressed.  She had cut herself with a razor at home and it was reported by her family that she also tried to stab herself.  However, there was no record of this on the hospital's clinical file.When she returned to the GF unit, it emerged her bed had been given to another patient and there was some delay in finding a bed for her.  During this delay in obtaining a bed she was noted to be anxious and stressed.  Her family feel that Ms Carroll was extremely distressed by the delay and that this contributed to her suicide.  They also stated they had expressed their concern to staff about her and requested that her clothes be taken from her.  The family feels that insufficient support was offered by the staff of the GF unit to the family in the immediate aftermath of Anne's death and stated there was no suitable place to spend time with her remains.The report into Ms Carroll's death outlines that the layout of the GF unit is unsuitable for the observation of patients.  There is no high-observation or special care unit within the GF unit.  A high-observation unit is an area within a psychiatric unit which provides a high level of observation while a patient is in an actually distressed state.  There are no specified intermediate levels of observation apart from general observation and special observation within the GF unit.  This means that in the absence of a high-observation area, the clinical staff is able to prescribe only special observation for patients requiring any observation level higher than that relating to general observation.The alarm system was stated to be unsatisfactory and does not always work.  It was stated the alarm system was not working on the day of Ms Carroll's death.  It is a practice in the GF unit to admit patients to beds of other patients who have gone on leave for one or more nights and who have previously been on leave.  The system does not allow for patients returning unexpectedly from leave because they become unwell.  Ms Carroll returned early from leave as she had cut her wrist.  Her bed had been taken by another person and there was considerable delay in obtaining a bed for her.  Eventually another patient was discharged by the consultant on call and this provided Ms Carroll with a bed.  The delay and uncertainty regarding whether she would obtain a bed appeared to have added to Ms Carroll's distress and agitation.  The use of leave beds for newly appointed patients results in an unsafe situation if patients return early from leave due to deterioration in their mental status.  There is no policy on leave beds and no audit had been carried out on the usage of beds.There was no documentation in the clinical file on the death of Ms Carroll, apart from the entry on the pronouncement of death by the cardiac arrest team.  There was no documentation of the interaction between Ms Carroll's family. which attended the GF unit following her death.  The last nursing entry outlines Ms Carroll's return from leave to the GF unit.  There was no documentation in the nursing file relating to her death.  The final entry states that she returned from leave and settled for the remainder of the night.  Due to this lack of documentation regarding the death of Miss Carroll and the immediate aftermath, the report found it difficult to draw a conclusion in respect of the support that her family received following the immediate aftermath of Ms Carroll's death.I ask the Minister of State to implore the Health Service Executive and the Minister for Health and Children to respond to the concerns expressed in the report to which I refer and to ensure the necessary investment is put in place to correct the situation I have outlined.  We must also ensure that further deaths do not take place in circumstances such as those to which I refer.  Again, I offer my sincere sympathy to the members of Anne Carroll's family, who are extremely distressed about her death.

The case referred to by Deputy Neville is tragic and I wish to extend my sincere condolences to the family concerned.In March 2005, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for mental health, Deputy Tim O'Malley, requested the Mental Health Commission to prepare a report on the circumstances of the death of the named person.  In November this year, the report was received in the Department.The Mental Health Commission, which was established in April 2002, is an independent statutory body, the primary function of which is to promote and foster high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure the interests of detained persons are protected.  The report of the mental health services inspectorate of the commission examined the service provided in the acute psychiatric unit — the GF unit — at Cork University Hospital and the physical layout thereof.  The report also examined the observation policies and procedures as well as bed usage and related matters.  In preparing its report, the commission sought information from the Health Service Executive southern area on the actions undertaken by the health service since the death of the named person.  The inspectorate also carried out a review of the circumstances surrounding the death.  The inspection took place on 19 and 20 January 2006.The GF unit at Cork University Hospital is the admission unit for the south Lee mental health services.  It is a 46-bed acute psychiatric unit.  There are 23 beds for male patients and 23 for female patients.  I am informed by the HSE that it is engaged in a process to redesign the unit, which will include a high-observation area.  A clinical audit committee has been established and staff have been provided with clinical risk management training.Under the Health Act 2004, operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly, the Department of Health and Children has written to the HSE requesting that all shortcomings identified in the report be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The Government adopted the report of the expert group on mental health policy in January 2006 and €26.2 million was made available this year to commence implementation. The latter amount includes €1.2 million made available to the HSE for suicide prevention initiatives.  A further €25 million will be made available in 2007.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the highest standard of patient care is provided within our mental health service in line with A Vision for Change.As Deputies are aware, the report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  It recommends a person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice and, most importantly, evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the provision of a sports grant from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in respect of the village of Golden, County Tipperary, where I reside.I was reluctant to raise this matter by way of the Adjournment.  I will, however, outline the background to it for the Minister of State.  I wish to express my disappointment with regard to the lack of funding for a project that has the support of the entire community.  More than two years ago, the local hall in which meetings and various sporting activities were held, was demolished because the local authority stated it was unfit for use and that insurance could not be obtained in respect of it.  At that time, the parish had run a lottery which yielded €1,000 per week.  In the interim, approximately €380,000 has been accumulated by way of lottery and other fund-raising activities.Proposals in respect of the project were put to the Department on four different occasions.  An application is currently with the Department in which it is proposed to build a new hall and sports centre that will accommodate the GAA and camogie clubs, the parish council and every other organisation within the parish.  Those in the parish were devastated last year when they discovered the project was not being funded by the Department.  They lobbied various Ministers and deputations met the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism on three occasions.  They were promised on each occasion that the money would be provided.  On their behalf, I wish to state that they were not merely disappointed but devastated that national lottery funding in respect of their proposal has not been forthcoming.  The most recent proposal was altered to bring it into line with the guidelines.I accept the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, does not have direct responsibility in this area.  However, I want him to relay what I am saying in respect of this project to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  It is of great importance to the community in this growing rural area.  Members observe week after week in this House that rural Ireland is thriving.  This project is an integral aspect of community life in the parish of Golden, County Tipperary, but the Government has let the community down.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to relate my views to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I was reluctant to raise the issue by this means but there does not seem to be any other way of putting pressure on the Minister to ensure the entitlements of this community.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, on whose behalf I thank the Deputy for raising it.  The Department's sports capital programme is an important element in ensuring the adequate provision of high-quality sports facilities to cater for the various requirements of governing bodies, clubs and local community sports organisations.  Under the programme, grants are allocated to sporting, voluntary and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities and equipment.  Through sports capital funding, the Government has provided unprecedented levels of funding for sport and its infrastructure.  Since 1998, a total of 5,755 such projects have benefited from more than €472 million in grant allocations.On applying for a grant, all applicants are issued with the guidelines, terms and conditions applying to the programme to ensure they are fully aware of all the requirements.  All applications are assessed on an individual basis by the Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria, as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions.  The assessment process takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant, the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required and the most recent census figures.  Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.Specific criteria used in assessing applications include a consideration of whether the project aims to increase active participation in sport or improve standards of sports performance in line with clearly stated targets.  Applicants should show how the funding will measure these increases or improvements.  In particular, facilities that help promote and enhance female participation in sport will be prioritised.  Priority will also be given to projects which meet a need for sporting facilities in disadvantaged areas.The availability of evidence of title to the project site, planning permission applied for or in place, drawings or specifications for the project and accurate costings for each element will also be of benefit to the applicants.  In addition, consideration will be given to whether the project is realistic in terms of scale, costs and grant assistance sought.  The club or organisation in question should be able to demonstrate a capacity to raise its contribution towards the cost so as to allow the project to be finished within a realistic timeframe.  Another factor to be considered is whether the project promoters can demonstrate the availability of an income stream to maintain the building when completed.The Department will assess whether the project has a high priority in regard to the applicant's existing facilities and whether there are similar sporting facilities already available in the area.  The application should include details and evidence of consultation with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority, especially those who will use the facility.  In addition, the application should clearly explain how the applicant will attract socially excluded people to use the facility.  In respect of projects at regional and national level, the Department will also consider whether the project fits in with the priorities for the relevant sport as identified by its national governing body.Highest priority is afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation.  High-priority projects include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance, including pitch development, floodlighting, changing rooms and showers.  At the end of the assessment process, each application is given its order of priority within its own county.  Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country.In the case of unsuccessful applications, the Department writes to the applicants concerned, enclosing a copy of their assessment and explaining why they were unsuccessful on that particular occasion.  This information can act as guidance to organisations in the submission of future applications for support under the programme.  It is open to the groups in Golden to reapply for funding under the programme once they meet certain minimum qualifying conditions as set out in the published terms and conditions of the programme.The 2007 round of the sports capital programme was advertised on 16 and 17 October last, with a closing date of 24 November 2006 for receipt of applications.  The Minister is satisfied that all applications received, including those from Golden, have been treated fairly and in accordance with the published requirements and assessment criteria.  The Deputy can be assured that any further applications received from those groups will be considered in the same fashion.Finally, it will be of interest to the Deputy that Golden-Kilfeacle GAA club received a grant in 2000.  Kilfeacle and District Rugby Club received grants in 2004 and 2005, as did Kilfeacle Community Association in 2000 and in 2002.  County Tipperary has been allocated more than €15.3 million since 1998, with 229 clubs and groups benefiting from the funding provided under the sports capital programme.  I will ensure the Minister is aware of the points raised by Deputy Hayes.

We are all aware that the number of housing management companies has increased at an enormous rate in recent years, and many of them are associated with new apartment complex developments.  Situations have arisen in many areas that leave much to be desired.  Fees are likely to increase at any time and, in some cases, the level and range of services is poor.This section of the market is poorly regulated.  In light of changes in yesterday's budget on tax relief for first-time buyers, it would be remiss not to review this area.  Many first-time buyers are on extremely tight budgets and some are faced with considerable fees from the management company of the apartment or housing complex in which they purchase their home.  These fees may be the equivalent of two monthly mortgage instalments.  Deputies from Dublin frequently encounter constituents who complain that they are paying management fees but receiving only inadequate service or none at all.  Fees generally include such services as refuse collection and maintenance of public areas but residents often complain that there is no standard of service in return for the exceptionally high charges.My colleague, Deputy Andrews, and I seek specific proposals from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this regard.  We accept the need for management companies in gated and enclosed housing and apartment complexes.  There must, however, be a level of supervision, regulation and inspection, whether on the part of local authorities or the Department.  Residents must have some means of recourse other than the legal route, which is prohibitively expensive for many.

This is a significant problem for residents in my constituency.  Huge numbers of apartments are being built every year and their owners find themselves faced with large bills for management fees.  I understand the National Consumer Agency proposed that action be taken to rectify the significant dearth of information in regard to the rights of home owners.  First-time buyers, in particular, are often not aware of the rules that apply to the type of ownership that obtains in apartments.Positive action is required on the part of the Government in respect of this unregulated area.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated his intention to establish a regulatory authority which will ensure that management agents have certain qualifications and are members of a professional body.  These proposals will be welcomed by the 500,000 people who live in apartments and must pay management fees that are often extortionate and in respect of which there is no transparency.  I look forward to hearing what action the Government will take.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I am taking the Adjournment of behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with special responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Noel Ahern.  I am glad of the opportunity to outline the action being taken to tackle issues of residential property management and to clarify certain matters.The Government is delivering on its commitment to regulate this sector.  The new property services regulatory authority, PSRA, being set up by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will license, regulate and deal with complaints about managing agents, often a key source of problems.  These are commercial entities that carry out the day-to-day work of managing and maintaining the development and collecting charges.  When complaints are made about management companies, it is often the case that the issues involved relate to activities of managing agents.A management company is composed of the homeowners in a development.  Some agents provide a good service, but complaints about issues such as poor standard of management and maintenance, high charges and lack of accountability often arise from their role.  Legislation to regulate property services, including the establishment and role of the PSRA, is being developed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A director of the authority has been appointed and an implementation group is in place to make the arrangements for the early establishment of the authority and its structures.While the regulation of managing agents will be central to ensuring an effective and user-friendly system of residential property management, there are also certain issues to be addressed with the management companies, or ownership companies, as it might be more accurate to describe them.  These companies are constituted under company law and broadly regulated by the Companies Acts.  The Law Reform Commission has recommended certain changes to company law to address problems for property management companies in that context.  For example, certain company law requirements are considered relatively onerous for the types of entities involved and some companies have been struck off the companies register because of non-compliance.  The proposals relating to management companies will be reflected in a Bill to consolidate and reform company law.As management companies are incorporated under the Companies Acts, the rights of property owners as members of companies are also governed by company law.  The company's memorandum and articles of association regulate its activities, setting out its objectives, membership and voting structure, accounts and auditing arrangements, proceedings for meetings and the structure and powers of its board of directors.  Members are entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting, examine the accounts and memorandum and articles of association and, where necessary, apply to the Director of Corporate Enforcement to have an annual general meeting called.Directors are appointed from among the members and manage the company in practice on behalf of the members.  Their functions include drawing up the annual budget, proposing works and services to be undertaken during the year, the amount to be put into the sinking fund and the level of charges required and informing the members of these and other relevant matters.  Where residents have problems with management, they should take these up with the directors in the first instance.  Tenants should approach their landlord as they have rights with management companies under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  In cases where companies are run well, one usually finds the directors are competent people, prepared to put time and effort into the successful running of the company and that the members take an active interest.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has acted to deal with certain planning-related issues that have impinged on management arrangements in some developments. For example, it has been made clear to local authorities that planning conditions requiring management companies should not be attached to planning permissions for traditional housing estates and that the existence of a management company does not relieve developers of their responsibilities for completing and maintaining estates.  A working group has been established to delineate local authority responsibility to take in charge public facilities in residential estates and further guidance will issue to planning authorities in early 2007.The Law Reform Commission is examining legal issues generally regarding management of multi-unit structures.  It is due to publish a consultation paper in the coming weeks, to be followed by a conference in late January, open to all interested parties.  The commission's paper is expected to address legal issues with a view both to preventing future problems and providing a way to rectify existing problems.  In light of the commission report, the Government will consider any necessary further measures.In the short term, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is pursuing with the construction industry measures to address some issues involving developers through a voluntary code of practice.  There has been a positive response from the industry.There is also an information deficit in this area.  Better consumer information and awareness will help to avoid some problems and frustration.  The National Consumer Agency has published an information booklet on management companies.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also compiled a short general information note, which is provided in response to queries.  The PSRA will also have a public information function on property management.Obligations of management companies are fundamentally matters of private contract.  Buyers need to ensure they have proper legal advice and information when signing contracts.  The long-standing principle of caveat emptor is very relevant.  Buyers, when signing contracts, should be watchful about the obligations into which they are entering.  Home owners should take an active interest in the operation of their management company.

That Committee is chaired by the Department of Transport, and both my Department and the Garda Síochána are represented on it, together with a range of other key stakeholders.I understand that the Department of Transport conducts regular security inspections and tests of aviation facilities and all operators at Irish airports.  These facilities and operators are also subject to audit by the European Union, European Civil Aviation Conference and International Civil Aviation Organisation, in partnership with the Department of Transport.  Moreover, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the protection of Shannon Airport is governed by a dedicated protection order, which is subject to continual review and modification in line with prevailing threat and risk assessments.In addition to these site-specific measures, the Garda Síochána maintains an up-to-date assessment of the threat to this State from international terrorist groups through analysis of intelligence gathered from domestic and international sources.  Moreover, the Garda Síochána has developed excellent lines of communication and co-operation with security and intelligence services in the European Union and further afield.  This ongoing sharing of intelligence enables a rapid operational response to be put in place where circumstances so warrant.It is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to comment on specific alleged threats or measures taken in response to ongoing security issues.  It suffices to say, however, that all threats are assessed by the Garda Síochána and appropriate measures taken, where necessary.With regard to liaison with the US authorities on flights, I understand that, pursuant to Article 29 of the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, all aircraft, if engaged in international air navigation and carrying cargo, must carry a manifest and detailed declarations of the cargo, in conformity with the conditions prescribed in the Convention,  As required, my Department is consulted by the Departments of Transport and/or Foreign Affairs in this regard.In relation to the use of Shannon Airport by the US, I would remind the House that Ireland has been making overflight and landing facilities available to the US for a period of more than fifty years.  Ireland has never withdrawn or suspended those facilities at any stage during that period.  Moreover, it will be recalled that, on 20 March, 2003, following extensive debate, this House approved the Government's decision not to withdraw such facilities.I am aware of the comments attributed to the US Secretary of Defence.  These are a matter for that official. With respect to Iraq, my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has noted that the presence of multi-national forces in Iraq has been mandated by a succession of UN Security Council Resolutions, most recently renewed in Resolution 1637 of 8 November, 2005.  Moreover, Security Council Resolution 1546 of June 2004 requested Member States of the United Nations to provide assistance to these multi-national forces.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	522	Published crime figures provide information on the number of homicide offences committed each year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been 20 murders with firearms since the beginning of this year to 6 December.  There were 19 murders with firearms recorded for the same period in 2005.All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of a rigorous investigation by the Garda authorities.  All available intelligence is analysed, and the identification of the motive and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution process.  Speculation as to the nature of the motive in particular crimes and the circumstances surrounding them could serve to jeopardise a successful investigation and prosecution and, accordingly, the house will appreciate the need for reticence in this regard.While there have been a number of murders concerning feuding gangs, there is no information available to the Garda authorities that these murders were the result of contract killings.  The Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has been tasked by Garda management with monitoring the movements and generating intelligence in relation to all known suspects who may be involved in this type of crime.I am assured by the Garda authorities that all information and intelligence available to An Garda Síochána concerning the threat to the safety of any individual's life is acted upon.  The Garda Síochána attach the highest priority to combating and preventing killings such as those resulting from organised crime and the activities of criminal gangs.  Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda Síochána in combating such crime and in particular murder.  The Operation, which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May, 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at my request, has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the Operation.  In particular, I am pleased to note that the number of offences of discharging a firearm was stable in the third quarter of this year, the most recent full quarter.  I believe that Operation Anvil has contributed significantly to this and also to the increase in that quarter of detections of offences of possession of drugs for sale or supply and of cultivation, manufacture or importation of drugs, which are closely associated with many murders using firearms.The most recent figures available to me show that since the introduction of Operation Anvil in May 2005, 549 firearms have been seized in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  Up to 19 November, Operation Anvil has resulted in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in more than 3,350  arrests for the serious crimes of murder, robbery, burglary and serious assaults, including 56 arrests in connection with murder.  Outside the DMR and up to 1 November, 2,600 persons have been arrested and 238 firearms seized.In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Garda Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  There has also been an increase in Garda monitoring and targeting of individuals and groups involved in armed crime in particular.Following the completion of the weapons amnesty on 31 October, the mandatory minimum sentences in relation to possession of firearms came into effect on 1 November.  The penalties available to the courts have now been greatly strengthened and stringent penalties now apply.I am very satisfied with the outcome of the 2007 Estimates process.  The allocation for the Garda Vote is increasing by €135.3 million to €1.445 billion — an increase of 10% on 2006.  This year's budget in turn represented an increase of 13% on 2005 and an increase of 85% in real terms since 1997.  The additional overtime allocation included in this will yield almost three million extra man hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.  As a result, successful anti-crime strategies and operations such as Operation Anvil will be continued and intensified on a nationwide basis.  This increase demonstrates that this Government continues to provide record resources for anti-crime strategies.The Government and I are also committed to increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána.  I am informed that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 on 16 November, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 21.5% (2,298) in the personnel strength of the Force in the period since then.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137.  Next year will see more than 275 fully trained Gardaí graduating from the Garda College every quarter, allowing the Commissioner to focus a highly visible policing presence throughout the country.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The personnel strength of An Garda Síochána (all ranks) as at 4 December, 2006 was 12,990. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.In October 2004, I announced that I was proceeding with the Government's promise to recruit 2,000 additional Gardaí over the life of the Government and an implementation plan to achieve that expansion was drawn up in consultation with the Commissioner.  That plan envisaged a recruiting strategy that would see the combined strength of the Force reaching some 14,044 Gardaí (including trainees) by the end of 2006.  The overall strength of the Force, including recruits in training is now in fact some 14,137.  So, we have delivered on our target well ahead of schedule.Recruitment 2004-2008Year EndingNew Entrant IntakeTotal (including trainees)Total (excluding trainees)200452312,74312,22020051,09613,38812,29220061,09614,04412,94820071,09714,62713,530200866114,66114,000Garda training involves 5 phases over a two year period. Phases I, III and V take place in the Garda College, Templemore and phases II and IV take place at Garda Stations to which trainees are assigned. Garda trainees are attested to the Force, and become serving members of the Force, on successful completion of phase III of their training. Therefore the serving strength of An Garda Síochána at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase III of their training but have not yet formally graduated. Graduation takes place following the fifth and final phase of training.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Gardaí (all ranks) who have retired, resigned or otherwise left the force from 6 June, 2002, to 4 December, 2006 was 1,942.  In addition, I have been further informed that a total of 3,174 new members have been attested to An Garda Síochána since 6 June, 2002 and 2,418 have graduated.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. A total of 1,125 recruits were inducted to the Garda Training College in 2005. The first four groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June, September and November of this year.  A further 1,114 were inducted to the Garda Training College this year and further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days hereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.

The Options paper focuses on three distinct types of non-married cohabiting relationships: opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples, and non-conjugal relationships.The Paper presents various options for unmarried opposite-sex cohabiting couples. The options presented are: contractual arrangements, a presumptive scheme, limited civil partnership (a civil registration scheme), full civil partnership (a civil registration scheme) and legislative review and reform. The Paper also examines each of these options for same-sex cohabiting couples. In addition the Working Group considered the question of making marriage available for same-sex couples. On this issue, the Paper comments that, in view of existing and recent case law, extending marriage to same-sex couples is likely to be vulnerable to constitutional challenge and notes that a judgment on the recognition in the State of a foreign same-sex marriage is awaited in the High Court. For non-conjugal couples, the Paper considers that the pragmatic approach of legislative review and reform is the appropriate way to address specific issues.The Government considers that significant improvements can be made within the fundamental context of the requirements of the Constitution and wants to deliver a framework in which non-married couples, including same-sex couples, can live in a supportive and a secure legal environment.Publication of the Options Paper comes at a time of wide public debate on the question of according legal status to cohabitants including same-sex couples. The Options Paper, together with the Law Reform Commission's Report on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants published on 1 December, are intended to inform public consultation and will assist in the formulation of policy in this area. It is intended that the development of legislative proposals will be on the basis of such consultation taking into account the views of interested groups and persons.

This represents 78% of the Garda stations with detention facilities.   Where a Garda station is not equipped with an audio/video system, a person to be interviewed in accordance with regulations is taken to the nearest Garda station with such equipment.My Department recently approved Garda proposals for the provision of additional systems and fit-out of further interview rooms.  I am advised by Garda authorities that a tender has been prepared and recently published in the EU Journal for provision of the equipment itself.  The fit-out of the rooms will be undertaken in consultation with the Office of Public Works.I am advised that the provision of additional rooms and equipment will enable An Garda Síochána to operate more effectively and will reduce the number of instances where persons have to be taken away from the investigating officer's home station to stations that have the equipment.

The Bill will build on the Report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics chaired by the former Chief Justice Ronan Keane.  That Report recognised the need for a procedure for dealing with complaints of judicial misconduct which, while serious in itself, might not warrant the ultimate sanction of impeachment by the Oireachtas.Consultations on the proposed Bill have, as is usual in the development of any legislative proposals, taken place with the Office of the Attorney General.   I have also considered it prudent, given the nature of the subject, to consult with the Chief Justice.  These consultations are on-going.It is my intention that when the Scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government, I will make it available to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  Any views that may emerge from the Joint Committee can be taken into account during the drafting of the Bill which will be proceeding at the same time.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I am pleased to be able to continue to report significant progress with regard to the implementation of the programme of civilianisation in An Garda Síochána.  I have provided this House with updates on Garda civilianisation on a number of occasions this year and propose to take this opportunity to recap and elaborate on some particularly noteworthy developments in this regard.A key success in the civilianisation process has been the establishment, of the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar, which now has a staffing complement of 162 civilians and is servicing all Garda regions nationally.  The GISC allows Gardaí who would otherwise have to return to their Stations to input data onto the PULSE system, to log the information with their civilian colleagues in the GISC, while remaining "on the beat".  This major initiative has freed up significant amounts of Garda time for frontline policing.  Quality control and review of data is also managed by dedicated civilian staff at the GISC, thereby relieving Sergeants of this administrative task and allowing them to be deployed for more operational duties.The success of the incident reporting and data quality review facilities available at the GISC encouraged the Garda authorities to seek opportunities for the devolution of further tasks to the Centre.  One such initiative involves the reporting of the outcome of court cases to the GISC, which allows Gardaí to remain operational following completion of their court attendances.  Having been successfully piloted in one Garda Division, a phased roll-out of this initiative to other Garda Divisions will take place over the coming months.  The call-taking function of Garda Traffic Watch has already transferred from six Regional Garda Communication Centres to the GISC.  Under a further initiative, the logging of driving licence and insurance particulars, a function formerly carried out by Gardaí and civilian personnel in the Fixed Charge Processing System, is now undertaken at the GISC.  All of these initiatives are contributing significantly to the release of Garda resources for visible, frontline policing across our communities.  It is proposed to carry out a review of the GISC in the summer of 2007 and the outcome of this evaluation will inform future projects.A further key development has been the transfer of civilian staff to the direct control of the Garda Commissioner, a reform provided for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  This transfer, which took place on 16 October last, brings all staff in An Garda Síochána — both Garda and civilian ranks — within the ambit of the Commissioner for the first time and should assist him in achieving the most effective and efficient deployment of both sets of resources.  In order to support the transfer of civilian staff, a new Human Resources Division for civilian staff in An Garda Síochána has been established, which when fully operational will have a staffing complement of 37 civilians.  The Head of the new HR Division has been appointed and a number of other staff have commenced duty, and recruitment of the remaining staff is underway.An enhanced administrative career structure is being put in place within An Garda Síochána.  The establishment of the GISC has added a significant number of supervisory and management posts to the civilian structure.  Furthermore, as part of an agreement reached with staff interests regarding the transfer of civilian staff to the Commissioner, sanction has been granted by the Minister for Finance for an additional 76 civilian clerical and administrative posts to be located around the country on a regional and divisional basis.  Recruitment to these posts will be progressed as soon as possible.Under the Garda Síochána Act, the Commissioner became the Accounting Officer for An Garda Síochána in July of this year.  This transfer of responsibility is being supported by the recruitment of nine civilian staff for a new Finance and Procurement Unit within An Garda Síochána.Meanwhile, a Joint Implementation Group comprising management representatives from An Garda Síochána and my Department is continuing its work on civilianisation.  Given that the 2001 Civilianisation Report was written at a particular point in time, the Group is taking account of changes which have occurred in the interim in the environment in which civilianisation is being pursued and exploring ways in which the civilianisation programme can be advanced in the short run, both in the context of the Civilianisation Report and otherwise. Significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of key specialised civilian posts, including:31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area;28 staff for the Professional Standards Unit, comprising statisticians, analysts and administrative staff;10 posts in the new Internal Audit Unit;14 additional teaching / training posts in the Garda College in Templemore; and29 posts for the new civilian Crime Analysis Service.The developments outlined above represent a major acceleration in the pace of civilianisation in An Garda Síochána.  I remain committed to achieving the greatest level of civilianisation consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda Síochána and will continue to work with the Garda Commissioner to drive the civilianisation programme forward.

It is common in some courts for a Judge to publicly state the reasons for his/her choice of sentence but I would accept that this practice is not universal.  I would certainly agree with the Director of Public Prosecutions that there should, as far as possible, be a clearly understandable rationale for sentencing.  I believe that this would be the view of the Judiciary also.In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that a range of measures are in train with this end in view.  The Judicial Studies Institute, which has significant funding available to it, organises seminars and training for Judges where matters such as sentencing can be addressed.  Following on a recent report by a committee chaired by Mr. Justice Fennelly of the Supreme Court steps have been taken to improve the dissemination of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Again, one of the terms of reference I have given to the Group which I recently established to examine ways of rebalancing the criminal justice system is to look at the question of allowing the Director Public Prosecutions to make submissions to the Court as to appropriate sentences.A very significant step in the area of sentencing was the decision by the Board of the Courts Service to establish a Steering Committee to plan for and provide a sentencing information system.  The Committee, which is composed of four members of the Judiciary and  an academic expert, reviewed systems of this nature around the world and decided to establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin.   Two researchers have been selected to collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated Courts in accordance with criteria specified by the Committee.  When the Steering Committee completes its work, further consideration can be given to the question of compiling a database of information on criminal sentences and the resources that may be needed for this purpose.

A member of An Garda Síochána must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.An Garda Síochána do not collate statistics on  the basis of the roles which offenders may have, either as individuals or as group members, when participating in criminal activity.  The other matters raised by the Deputy are a matter for the Courts Service which is independent in the performance of its functions.

The Commission is in a preparatory stage at present.I understand that the initial work of the Commission has involved study visits to their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK and initial meetings with the various stakeholders involved in the Garda complaints system, such as Garda management, the Garda representative bodies and officials of my Department.  This process is aimed at enabling the Commission to establish principles regarding its approach to investigating complaints and to work on the development of operational protocols with the Garda Síochána.The Commission has advertised all of its senior posts — Director of Investigations, Deputy Director of Investigations, Director of Administration and Head of Legal Affairs — and all of its investigative staff. General staff will be sourced from within the Civil Service. In respect of a number of key senior posts, interviewing has been completed and successful candidates have been identified. In these cases employment contracts are being finalised. Interviewing is currently taking place in respect of a number of other posts.The Commission is working towards being in a position to receive complaints as soon as possible in 2007.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The Government is completely opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition, and our concerns in this regard have been made clear at the highest level of the US Government over an extended period of time.  In response, the United States has provided categorical, unqualified assurances that Irish airports or territory have not been used for this purpose.I have repeatedly stated that any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose should immediately report their concerns to the Garda Síochána, which would have responsibility for investigating such matters.  On this basis of such reporting or any other information, where the Garda Síochána reasonably suspects that an offence is being committed, statutory powers of entry and arrest are available, subject to international law.To date, where complaints of alleged unlawful activity concerning the use of Irish airports have been made to the Garda Síochána, Garda investigations have ensued and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of any unlawful activity.Having regard to the foregoing, I consider that all reasonable, appropriate and sufficient measures have been and are being taken to ensure that Irish airports are not being used for any unlawful activity.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the volume and street value of heroin seized for the first ten months of 2005 and 2006 is as set out in the table.YearQuantityEstimated Street Valuekg€2005122,400,0002006115.7523,150,000Of course the Government would view with concern any apparent rise in the level of any illegal drugs being trafficked into this country.  However, the seizures also reflect the success of the Gardai's law enforcement measures targeting drug trafficking.  The drugs situation is dictated by global developments, it is dynamic and ever changing and our policies need to be flexible to meet those changes.In terms of estimating the proportion of drug seizures made in this jurisdiction by our law enforcement authorities in relation to the overall volumes of drugs being trafficked, obviously given the clandestine nature of this illegal activity this is extremely difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty and is speculative.However, what can be said in this regard though is that the global illicit drug trade is, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), reputed to exceed billions of US$ annually. That UN office estimated in 2005 that global seizures for that year accounted for 44% of cocaine production, 28% of cannabis resin, 25% of opium production, 7% of amphetamines and 4.7% of ecstasy.Undoubtedly, drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally. Our drug law enforcement response is of course a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.  Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures that we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.  The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. Noel Ahern, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department's remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework.An Garda Siochana invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following:Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this stateConducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs tradeWorking in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.Tackling organised crime and drug trafficking is primarily achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations.  The Organised Crime Unit, established in November 2005, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Gardai, continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.Significant drug seizures including the considerable increase in the amount of heroin already seized this year to date, referred to earlier, have been made as a result of these operations. The operations, which are ongoing, continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade.The record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, being made available to An Garda Síochána this year is proof of the Government's commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime. This commitment is further evidenced by the fact that the allocation for the Garda Vote for 2007 is up by €135.3m to €1.445 billion — an increase of 10% on this year's allocation.Furthermore we are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work tackling those involved in such criminal activity.While our legislative package for tackling drug trafficking is already viewed as being one of the most stringent in Europe, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for further measures which will enhance the powers of the Gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.I can assure the House that the policy of targeting those involved in organised crime including drug trafficking and the gun culture with which it is associated remains the Government's top policing priority.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 36 together.I recently published two important reports recommending radical reform of the top management structure of An Garda Síochána. The reports are by the Garda Síochána Inspectorate and the Garda Síochána Advisory Group chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes.By way of background, the Garda Síochána Inspectorate was established in July 2006.  Its objective under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 is to ensure that the resources available to An Garda Síochána are used so as to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.  This is the Inspectorate's first report.  The Advisory Group was appointed by me in August 2006 to advise the Garda Commissioner on addressing the leadership and management challenges currently facing the Garda Síochána. This is the Advisory Group's first, and interim, report to the Garda Commissioner.The reports recommend enhanced civilian support for senior Garda management and urge accelerated recruitment of civilian support staff so as to release Gardaí for operational duties.  Some key recommendations includea new civilian post at Deputy Garda Commissioner level to deal with administration and resource management, including areas such as finance and information technology,three new executive civilian posts, namely Legal Advisor, Director of Human Resource Management and Director of ICT, at the level of Assistant Commissioner.    More generally, the Advisory Group urges,a new post of Assistant Commissioner for professional standards, reporting direct to the Garda Commissioner.maximum delegation of operational responsibility to the Assistant Commissioners in charge of the Regions, with appropriate support by civilian staff in areas such as finance, HR and analysis,a realignment of the Garda Síochána's organisational chart to recognise the central role of these Regional Commissioners and the core policing functions they exercise.I very much welcome these timely reports as a very significant contribution to the current reform and renewal of An Garda Síochána. I have recently brought the reports to the attention of the Government which is fully supportive of these recommendations contained therein.The Garda Síochána Inspectorate is currently undertaking an operational and administrative assessment of the Garda Síochána, including resource allocation and the deployment of Garda and civilian personnel.  I have asked for an interim report from the Inspectorate on its assessment no later than end January 2007. Following receipt of that report, I intend to bring specific proposals to Government at that stage in relation to the implementation of its recommendations and in relation to the implementation of these existing reports.Finally, I should emphasise that the reports on the reform of the Garda management structure are the beginning and not the end of a process of reform and modernisation.  I want to thank the members of the Advisory Group and the Inspectorate for the work they have put into these reports, and I also want to acknowledge the co-operation they have received from An Garda Síochána.

I understand from Mr Mellett that his inquiries are at an advanced stage, but that certain material of particular relevance to the inquiry is still in the process of being obtained by him.  I cannot give the Deputy a definitive indication of when I might expect to receive the Report, but I am hopeful that I will receive it in the near future.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The Consultation Paper on Legitimate Defence published by the Law Reform Commission on 20 November, 2006 includes a number of provisional recommendations.  As the Deputy will be aware a consultation paper provides interested parties with an opportunity to make submissions on the issues and recommendations set out in the paper.  The Law Reform Commission will publish a report containing its final recommendations when this consultation process is complete.The Consultation Paper considers a range of issues which arise in relation to legitimate defence and the Paper also contains some provisional recommendations in relation to the issue of householders rights to defend themselves and their property, a topic which has been the subject of much debate in recent months.While the Law Reform Commission has not yet issued its final recommendations in relation to the topic of legitimate defence, and I do not in any way wish to pre-empt their final conclusions, their provisional recommendations in relation to defence of the home are very helpful in the context of the current debate.  It is in particular interesting to note that the Commission has now highlighted the need for the rights of individuals to be clearly understood, to de-mystify the issue and to reform the law.  The view of the Law Reform Commission that the occupant of a house under the present law has an arguable duty to retreat in the face of violent attack and to leave his or her house rather than defend him/herself is clearly an imbalance in the law which has to be addressed and rectified.As we are all aware this is a sensitive topic which has given rise to understandable public concern and emotion.  I am of the view that the balance must be struck in favour of the householder, but equally we must ensure that any proposals which emerge are proportionate.As the Deputy will be aware, last June there were two Private Members Bills introduced in the Oireachtas on the issue of defence and protection of the family home, one introduced by Senator Tom Morrissey in the Seanad and the other by  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in the Dáil.  When I spoke in the Dáil on this issue I gave a commitment to give serious consideration to amending the law in this area.  Since then my Department has been examining the legal issues involved and the recommendations contained in the Consultation Paper are now being considered.  I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government very shortly.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Gardaí assigned to Community Policing as at 30 September, 2006 was 482 (all ranks). This figure represents  almost 4% of the current personnel strength of An Garda Síochána.I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. This includes the allocation of personnel to Community Garda Units.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.The current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  In October 2004, I announced that I was proceeding with the Government's promise to recruit 2,000 additional Gardaí over the life of the Government and an implementation plan to achieve that expansion was drawn up in consultation with the Commissioner.That plan envisaged a recruiting strategy that would see the combined strength of the Force reaching some 14,044 Gardaí (including trainees) by the end of 2006.  The overall strength of the Force, including recruits in training is now in fact some 14,137.  So, we have delivered on our target well ahead of schedule.Recruitment 2004-2008Year EndingNew Entrant IntakeTotal (including trainees)Total (excluding trainees)200452312,74312,22020051,09613,38812,29220061,09614,04412,94820071,09714,62713,530200866114,66114,000The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Community Policing will be given the fullest consideration.

For example, the homicide rate in Glasgow, a city of comparable size to Dublin, is 5.5 per 100,000 of the population. The comparable figure for Dublin in 2005 is 1.7 per 100,000. The rate of murder/manslaughter in Ireland in 1995 was 1.47 per 100,000 of the population. The comparative figure for 2005 is 1.41 per 100,000 of the population.Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda Síochána in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 7 of today's date for details of successes to date of the Operation.  In addition, a wide range of provisions to combat gun crime were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.  With effect from 1 November, mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, came into effect for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.  Furthermore there are in place new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as "sawing off" a shotgun.The provisions for sentencing now in place are as follows:Possession of firearms with intent to endanger life — maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;Use of firearms to resist arrest or aid escape — maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;Possession of firearm while hijacking a  vehicle — maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment;Possession of firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances — maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment;Carrying firearm with criminal intent — maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment; andAltering a Firearm — maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.The new law specifies that the courts may exercise discretion to impose less than the minimum sentence only where it is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances for doing so.  In addition, it may exercise its discretion only in the case of a first offence.  Where a person charged with any of the above offences has been previously convicted of any such offence, then the court has no discretion and must impose at least the mandatory minimum sentence.  I am confident that these stringent new provisions, combined with the continuing efforts of the Gardaí in Operation Anvil, will go a long way to ensuring that those found in possession of firearms will pay a very serious price for their crimes.I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend to have lower conviction rates than other murders.  This is not unique to Ireland. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the highest priority is given by An Garda Síochána to the investigation of murders and the detection of those responsible.RecordedDetectedProceedings CommencedConvictions2006*(up to 5 December)207402005214212004985320032011422002105432001962220001276219991277519984321* Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change.

A key success in the civilianisation process has been the establishment, of the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar, which now has a staffing complement of 162 civilians and is servicing all Garda regions nationally.The success of the incident reporting and data quality review facilities available at the GISC encouraged the Garda authorities to seek opportunities for the devolution of further tasks to the Centre.  One such initiative involves the reporting of the outcome of court cases to the GISC, which allows Gardaí to remain operational following completion of their court attendances.  The call-taking function of Garda Traffic Watch has already transferred from six Regional Garda Communication Centres to the GISC.  Under a further initiative, the logging of driving licence and insurance particulars, a function formerly carried out by Gardaí and civilian personnel in the Fixed Charge Processing System, is now undertaken at the GISC.  All of these initiatives are contributing significantly to the release of Garda resources for visible, frontline policing across our communities.  It is proposed to carry out a review of the GISC in the summer of 2007 and the outcome of this evaluation will inform future projects.A new Human Resources Division for civilian staff in An Garda Síochána has been established, which when fully operational will have a staffing complement of 37 civilians.  Sanction has been granted by the Minister for Finance for an additional 76 civilian clerical and administrative posts to be located around the country on a regional and divisional basis.  Recruitment to these posts will be progressed as soon as possible.Under the Garda Síochána Act, the Commissioner became the Accounting Officer for An Garda Síochána in July of this year.  This transfer of responsibility is being supported by the recruitment of nine civilian staff for a new Finance and Procurement Unit within An Garda Síochána.Meanwhile, a Joint Implementation Group comprising management representatives from An Garda Síochána and my Department is continuing its work on civilianisation.  Given that the 2001 Civilianisation Report was written at a particular point in time, the Group is taking account of changes which have occurred in the interim in the environment in which civilianisation is being pursued and exploring ways in which the civilianisation programme can be advanced in the short run, both in the context of the Civilianisation Report and otherwise. Significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of key specialised civilian posts, including:31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area;28 staff for the Professional Standards Unit, comprising statisticians, analysts and administrative staff;10 posts in the new Internal Audit Unit;14 additional teaching / training posts in the Garda College in Templemore; and29 posts for the new civilian Crime Analysis Service.The developments outlined above represent a major acceleration in the pace of civilianisation in An Garda Síochána.  I remain committed to achieving the greatest level of civilianisation consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda Síochána and will continue to work with the Garda Commissioner to drive the civilianisation programme forward.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of non-Garda clerical staff employed by An Garda Síochána as of 30 November 2006 is 1,156.  The number of non-Garda clerical staff placed in each Garda Division and the Stations that they are  assigned to are set out in the table.NumberCarlow/Kildare24Naas8Maynooth1Kildare3Newbridge1Carlow5Athy1Baltinglass3Blessington1Tullow1Cavan/Monaghan20Monaghan8Bailieborough4Ballyconnell2Carrickmacross2Castleblaney1Cavan3Clare23Ennis13Shannon1Ennistymon3Killaloe2Scariff1Kilrush3Cork City52Anglesea Street27Barrack Street2Bridewell1Gurranabraher4Blarney1Ballincollig1Mayfield4MacCurtain St1Mallow Road1Togher6Douglas1Bishopstown2Carrigaline1Cork North16Fermoy4Cobh2Mitchelstown1Midleton3Youghal1Mallow4Charleville1Cork West18Bandon7Bantry2Clonakility2Kanturk3Macroom3Kinsale1Donegal13Letterkenny8Buncrana1Ballyshannon1Milford1Glenties2Galway West23Millstreet14Salthill3Clifden1Gort2Loughrea2Portumna1Kerry17Tralee7Dingle1Caherciveen1Killarney5Listowel3Laois/Offaly16Portlaoise7Abbeyleix3Birr3Banagher1Tullamore2Limerick40Henry Street20Mayorstone2Roxboro Road8Askeaton2Rathkeale1Newcastlewest3Abbeyfeale1Bruff3Longford/ Westmeath21Mullingar8Athlone5Granard3Longford4Lanesboro1Louth/Meath32Dundalk4Drogheda11Navan4Trim3Kells3Balbriggan3Ashbourne2Skerries1Dunboyne1Mayo184Castlebar7Ballina3Belmullet2Claremorris3Ballinrobe1Swinford3Westport3G.I.S.C.162Roscommon/Galway East16Roscommon5Ballinasloe2Mountbellew1Boyle2Castlerea4Tuam2Sligo/Leitrim15Sligo8Ballymote2Carrick-on-Shannon3Manorhamilton2Tipperary59Thurles7Cahir3Clonmel7Carrick On Suir1Nenagh3Borrisokane1Templemore1Roscrea1Tipperary2Garda Central Vetting Unit33Garda College22Garda College22Waterford/Kilkenny25Waterford11Dungarvan4Tramore2Kilkenny5Thomastown2Graiguenamanagh1Wexford/Wicklow21Wexford6Enniscorthy2Blackwater1Gorey5Arklow1New Ross3Wicklow3D.M.R.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I  have been further informed by the Garda authorities that there are no Gardaí seconded to work on Operation Freeflow. The personnel deployed on Operation Freeflow, in addition to the Garda Traffic Corps and Traffic Units, are resourced from within their respective Divisions, as all Gardaí have responsibility to deal with the enforcement of traffic legislation.   A number of Gardaí are specifically deployed to assist the Garda Traffic Corps and Traffic Units throughout the country on Operation Freeflow, from 27 November, 2006 to 7 January, 2007, as set out in the table hereunder:DivisionNumberCork City22D.M.R.

West25Galway West13Limerick8I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

However I can say that there is regular and ongoing contact between the Group and officials from my Department.  As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question Number 99 of 7 November 2006 the Group is, with my agreement, taking the time to allow it to comprehend the current module of the Morris Tribunal in its work. As the Deputy may be aware the current module is dealing extensively with the question of detention of suspects.I am hopeful that the Group will be in a position to report to me in early 2007 and, as I have stated previously, I intend to publish its report.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The Garda Síochána Act, in 2005, made detailed provisions for the making of Disciplinary Regulations for the Garda Síochána.  In its report earlier this year, the Garda Síochána Act Implementation Group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, acknowledged the requirement for changes to the Garda disciplinary regulations to coincide with the coming into operation of the Garda Ombudsman Commission. The Group was strongly of the view that the opportunity should be taken for a comprehensive revision of the Garda disciplinary framework so as to bring it into line with modern practice in human resource management.Subsequently, on 19 May 2006, the Government statement regarding Reports of the Morris Tribunal acknowledged and accepted the views of the Tribunal that the current disciplinary regulations need to be replaced by a new, less complex, approach which will be swift and fair with a simple appeal process.On 17 August, on publication of the 3rd, 4th and 5th reports of the Morris Tribunal, I  published new draft Garda Discipline Regulations which were drawn up in consultation with the Garda Commissioner. These draft regulations take account of the recommendations of the Morris Tribunal, follow well-established principles in the public sector and beyond, and are significantly more streamlined than existing Garda Discipline Regulations. The new draft regulations have been put into the Garda Conciliation Council for discussion with the Garda Representative Associations and, in recognition of the fundamental changes now proposed, I have made available additional time beyond the original target date of the Summer recess.  I am informed that the Garda Representative Associations have engaged positively in those discussions. I expect that the discussions can be concluded quickly and effectively, and I look forward to bringing final proposals to Government for approval in this regard.

It is open to Ireland to opt in to the Directive at any time and consideration is being given to this at present.  It is also important to separate the issues of how Ireland deals with victims of trafficking from that of the signature of the various instruments in this area.The current Irish Immigration system allows the authorities to deal with the victims of trafficking in a sympathetic and pragmatic way and there is no significant evidence that this is not being done or that our non-participation in those instruments is having a negative impact on victims.  Any necessary assistance is provided to victims by the services of the State.

The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Youghal Garda Station as at 5 December, 2006 was 21 (all ranks). Youghal Garda Station forms part of the Midleton District. The personnel strength of Midleton District as at 31 December, 1997 was 56 (all ranks). The personnel strength of Midleton District as at 6 December, 2006 was 71 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 15 (or 26.7%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.The opening hours of Youghal Garda Station are from 8am to 10pm daily. The opening hours at Youghal Garda Station were revised in December, 2003. Local Garda Management report that the revised opening hours have been monitored and reviewed on a regular basis since their introduction. They have regularly met with local representatives and have kept them informed of all developments.  Local Garda Management also report that they are satisfied that the current policing arrangements in Youghal and the revised opening hours have and will continue to have a positive impact on policing in the town.Finally, I am informed by Garda management that they consider that the extension of the opening hours at Youghal Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.

The decision not to deport a person who is illegally in the State i.e. grant temporary leave to remain, arises under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.  Each case is individually considered in the context of its own particular circumstances, having regard to the eleven factors cited in the Act, and having regard to Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV systems in public places for the purposes of crime prevention and crime detection by the Garda Síochána and community based groups.The Act does not apply to persons operating CCTV cameras on their premises for the purposes of protecting persons or property on the premises or environs.As the Deputy is aware the main content of the newspaper article to which he refers is the misuse of private CCTV systems. Officials of my Department examined a possible amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Act 1997 with a view to broadening the definition of harassment to make it an offence to video record or photograph persons without their knowledge in any place that a person could reasonably expect privacy.Following the advice of the Attorney General  I am now addressing this issue in the context of the Privacy Bill, which was published on 4 July 2006. The Bill creates an offence, to be known as the tort of invasion of privacy, for a person wilfully and without lawful authority to violate the privacy of another individual. Where material obtained from closed circuit television or other monitoring equipment may be used in an inappropriate manner then the aggrieved person will have an accessible remedy in law.The Privacy Bill contains a defence (in Section 5) in a privacy action for a defendant to prove that the act in respect of which a privacy action is being brought consisted of the installation or operation, in good faith, of a closed circuit television system or other surveillance system for a purpose authorised by law, or for the purpose of detecting or preventing the commission of an offence or the protection of persons or property.

This assessment is based on the analysis of data supplied to the centre during the years 1999 to 2004 inclusive.As part of its on-going analysis of the drugs market within this jurisdiction, An Garda Síochána monitors the price of all illegal drugs.In relation to the principal illicit drugs namely, cannabis, cannabis resin, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamine, the Garda authorities inform me that their analysis shows a reduction in the price of all these illicit drugs over the past five years with the exception of heroin whose price has remained relatively stable.In relation to the measures being taken by An Garda Síochána to tackle the problem of drug trafficking, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question reference number 41919 of today.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Violence against Women on any level and in any context is a serious crime.  Frequently in a domestic context it gravely affects not just the victim but also impacts very negatively on her children.  As a crime, it is essential that the perpetrator is prosecuted and brought to justice.  It is also essential that the victim receives all appropriate care and support and, should she require it, medical  treatment if necessary.  This may also involve the provision of emergency housing.Accordingly, a single victim may require services which fall appropriately within the remit of the Minister for Health and Children through the Health Service Executive; the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities; and through the agencies of my own Department, particularly the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Probation and Welfare Service and the Legal Aid Board and also services such as court accompaniment and perpetrator programmes which are provided with funding support by my Department.The National Steering Committee on Violence against Women was established in accordance with the recommendations of the 1997 Task Force on Violence against Women and  it meets regularly under the chairmanship of Minister of State Frank Fahey T.D. to collaborate on the delivery of services.  A firm of consultants was engaged to make recommendations on a new strategic action plan for the National Steering Committee and those recommendations, which very recently came to hand, are under consideration in my Department at present.  This process will inform the ongoing and valuable work of the National Steering Committee.As many of the services which address violence against women, such as the criminal and civil justice systems and the health services, are delivered in the context of a wider reaching service, it does not appear to be feasible to transfer financial and administrative responsibility for specific elements of the services to a single Minister.  Indeed an Inter-Departmental Sub-Committee of the National Steering Committee reviewed the funding arrangements in 2005 and made a series of recommendations but did not propose the transfer of responsibility to a single Department.The Sub-Committee stressed the importance of co-ordination in the approach to the issue and I firmly believe that it is important that there is continuing co-ordination of services and that they are adequately funded within the responsible Departments and Agencies.  I am pleased that the funding available to my own Department for awareness raising and perpetrator programmes has increased by 32% for 2007.Substantial funding is made available in the other Government Departments for the agencies under their remit.  Identified needs are being addressed and being met to the fullest extent possible.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I presume the Deputy is referring to a recommendation in a report entitled "Inequality and the Stereotyping of Young People", published by the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Equality Authority.I do not agree that there is an urgent need to extend the provisions of the Equal Status Acts on the age ground to people under eighteen.  The reason for excluding under 18s from claiming discrimination on the age ground is that 18 is a standard cut-off for access to many services, e.g. it is the age of majority, the age at which contractual commitments are fully enforceable, the age for sale of drink, access to certain films etc.  It would be impractical to extend the age ground to under 18s as this would necessitate the provision of an extraordinary number of exemptions within the legislation and would entail a revisiting of virtually every area of the Equal Status Act. It would also mean that, in principle, it would no longer be permissible to give any preference (such as a reduced price) to young people.Under Section 3(3) of the Equal Status Act 2000 a person who is less than 18 cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground.   Equally, a person who is 18 or over cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground  which is based on a comparison with a person aged less than 18 (for example, an adult cannot seek children's fare on a bus).I would emphasise, however, that the Act does apply to discrimination against under 18s based on the other eight grounds.  It is, therefore, possible for a young person to bring a claim of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, membership of the Traveller community etc.  It is not correct to say that the Act excludes young people.The Government has amended the Equal Status Act twice to make changes in the way it impacts on young people. It clarified the law in relation to the regulation of access to licensed premises by persons under 18 years of age and the conditions under which it is permissible to set an age limit for the purchase of liquor higher than 18 years. The Government also amended the Equal Status Act to apply it to discrimination on the age ground in the provision of motor vehicle insurance to drivers under 18 years of age.The Government has shown that it is prepared to consider well founded proposals for changes to Equality Legislation. However a general application of the age ground to persons under 18 would not be practical or appropriate.

When I published the Scheme of the Bill on 6 September 2006, I indicated that further suggestions and comments would be welcomed and I advised of a dedicated email address (immigrationbill@justice.ie); for any such input.  My Department also made contact with those who made the original submissions to notify them of this opportunity.  A number of submissions have been received since then and I welcome this continued engagement with the legislative process.

The purpose of the Board is to identify persons and inform the Government of the suitability of those persons for judicial office, including appointments to the Supreme Court.The Board consists of the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, the Attorney General, nominated representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.This procedure does not apply where the Government proposes to advise the President to appoint to judicial office a person who is already a judge or, subject to certain conditions, holds certain European or international judicial offices as set out in section 5 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 as amended.  It is very often the case that a vacancy on the Supreme Court is filled in this manner by an already serving Judge.The Government has no plans to alter the way in which judges or other persons are nominated for appointment by the President to the Supreme Court.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.The personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána as at 31 December, 2002-2005, inclusively, and as at 4 December, 2006, was as set out in the following table.31/12/0231/12/0331/12/0431/12/0516/11/06Personnel strength11,89512,01712,20912,26413,000I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 95 Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, including 2 Juvenile Liaison Officers in the Carlow/Kildare Division. In addition, the National Juvenile Office has a staff of 1 Superintendent, (the Director of Diversion Programme), 1 Inspector and 2 Sergeants.I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Juvenile Liaison Officers as at 31 December, 2002-2005, inclusive, was as set out in the following table.31/12/0231/12/0331/12/0431/12/05JLOs93939495JLOs are responsible for implementing the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, which provides an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity.  It operates on a nationwide basis under the supervision and direction of the Garda National Juvenile Office, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2.  The Programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.In addition to the Juvenile Diversion Programme, there are also 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects nationwide.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature. These projects cater for approximately 2,500 participants per annum and are particularly targeted at 10-18 year old "at risk" youths in communities where a specific need has been identified. The allocation of funding for the 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over €6.6 million, which is an increase of €1.2 million on 2005.It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  Recently, I announced the establishment of ten new projects located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects). The appointment of additional Juvenile Liaison Officers for these projects is under consideration.I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

There have also been a small number of unsuccessful attempts to perpetrate such raids.  The Garda authorities have also informed me that comparable figures for the preceding four years are not immediately available.  These are now being collated and I will communicate with the Deputy in due course.The Garda authorities further inform me that there are agreed response procedures between An Garda Síochána and the banks and financial institutions to deal with hostage situations where members of staff or their families are taken hostage in order to facilitate robberies.  These response procedures are detailed and all encompassing.An Garda Síochána does not, as a matter of policy and security, disclose information on the detail of these procedures.

I am happy to take this opportunity to clarify the position to the Deputy.I should say at the outset that the provision of services to the homeless falls firmly within the responsibility of the local authorities.  The category of homeless persons in this context includes: all persons, including Irish persons, who have failed the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC); persons from any EU Member State — not just the 10 accession States — who may find themselves homeless; and any other foreign nationals who may find themselves homeless.The single exception to the local authorities' responsibilities in this area is in relation to asylum seekers who are accommodated by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.   All asylum seekers are provided with accommodation in one of RIA's  fifty accommodation centres located throughout the State.The Deputy may wish to note that on a very specific and limited basis, the  RIA also organises the repatriation of those persons from the 10 Accession States who have failed the HRC.  This task is carried out an agency basis for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and involves short term accommodation pending the arrangement of travel. The scheme is very narrowly focused on the 10 States involved.As regards the services generally available for persons from the new EU States, this is a matter for individual Departments and Agencies. My Department's role focuses solely on the promotion and co-ordination of integration measures.  In this context, I should add that the RIA is actively engaged with a wide variety of stakeholders in the integration area and  targeted projects are being developed with the assistance of the special €5M Integration Fund which I announced earlier this year.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.Garda training involves 5 phases over a two year period. Phases I, III and V take place in the Garda College, Templemore and phases II and IV take place at Garda Stations to which trainees are assigned. Garda trainees are attested to the Force, and become serving members of the Force, on successful completion of phase III of their training. Therefore the serving strength of An Garda Síochána at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase III of their training but have not yet formally graduated. Graduation takes place following the fifth and final phase of training.I have been further informed that the number of Garda recruits who have graduated from the Garda Training College and the number of new members who have been attested to the Force since 6 June, 2002 is 2,418 and 3,174, respectively.The current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. As will be seen from the table, the intake of recruits to the Garda Training College has doubled in comparison to the average of previous years to 1,125 and 1,114, in 2005 and 2006, respectively.20022003200420052006Intake to Garda Training College5466905191,1251,114It is planned to induct a further 1,100 recruits in 2007 which will result in a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008.

The legislation provides for specific arrangements for prisoners to exercise their franchise by way of postal voting.In accordance with the provisions of the legislation, relevant officials will be appointed in each prison who will be responsible for ensuring that prisoners who are eligible and wish to vote will be facilitated in exercising that right.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be drawing up guidance for postal voting for prisoners and will consult with relevant officials from my Department on the matter.  Within this framework, officials in the Irish Prison Service will prepare operating procedures that will allow for the practical arrangements to be put in place.   Of course, it will be important to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, providing for and facilitating as much as possible a prisoner's right to vote and, on the other, the need to maintain an orderly and appropriate regime within our prisons.It is important that steps are taken to help ensure that prisoners will be fully aware of their entitlement to vote and there are various mechanisms available in this regard.   The legislation requires local authorities to give public notice of the availability of prisoner postal voting.  Application forms and explanatory information will be made available by the local authorities and will be available in every prison.  In addition, prisoners will be provided with details of their voting rights together with other information on the prison regime on their arrival in prison.  Complementing that, it should be possible to arrange for appropriate posters to be devised advertising the new arrangements within the prisons.   Leaflets can also be developed specifically for prisoners, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, for distribution by the Prison Service.It is hoped to undertake and finalise the practical implementation of the legislation as quickly as possible.

I would propose to supplement that earlier response with a number of brief observations.The Options Paper on Domestic Partnership, prepared by a Working Group established by me in March 2006, was published on 28 November. The Options Paper focuses on three distinct types of cohabiting relationships: opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples and non-conjugal relationships. The options outlined for same-sex couples are: marriage, full civil partnership (a civil registration scheme), contractual arrangements, a presumptive scheme, limited civil partnership (a civil registration scheme) and legislative review and reform.  The Paper comments that, in view of existing and recent case law, extending marriage to same-sex couples is likely to be vulnerable to constitutional challenge and notes that a judgment on the recognition in the State of a foreign same-sex marriage is awaited in the High Court.The Options Paper is intended for public consultation and, together with the Law Reform Commission's Report on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants published on 1 December 2006, will assist in the future formulation of policy in this area.The question of the rights and entitlements of non-EU national partners of Irish citizens, including same-sex partners, will be dealt with in the context of the proposed Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill the scheme of which I published for public consultation on 6 September 2006.  Provisions, it is intended, will be set out in an accessible and transparent fashion through the medium of policy statements as referred to in the Bill.

I considered that I should take the opportunity presented by the legislation to introduce the necessary enabling provisions.    However, I should add that I do not intend to introduce Electronic Monitoring immediately.  The cost effectiveness of Electronic Monitoring and developments in technology are being monitored and consideration is being given as to what arrangements would bring the maximum added value to the criminal justice system.

In addition, Garda attention is afforded to the individual and their family.While the threat remains the situation is constantly reviewed by local Garda management in consultation with other specialist Garda units.The incident referred to is under active investigation by the Gardaí at Swords Garda Station, assisted by other specialist Garda units under Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.Two persons were arrested on Tuesday, 5 December, 2006 in connection with the death of the person referred to.

In order to achieve this goal An Garda Síochána has sectioned the road network into 8km zones and analysed the collisions data for the past ten years within these zones.  A weighting is then assigned to each zone based on the collision data.  Enforcement is then prioritised based on the weighting.  The type and levels of enforcement for the various road traffic offences are based on the factors identified as contributing to the collisions.Garda road safety presentations constantly take place with regular presentations in secondary schools, third level colleges and to large enterprises.  These presentations are aimed at raising road safety awareness, particularly amongst young drivers, with a view to improving driver behaviour and bringing about an improved compliance culture.It is generally a hard core of youths who engage in so-called joy-riding, many of whom are known to the Gardaí.  Unfortunately, there is a high degree of recidivism.  The Gardaí continually monitor trends in car theft, with a view to identifying and targeting persistent offenders and policing areas which are unfortunately prone to suffer such activities.  Persons serving sentences for persistent offences related to so-called joy-riding are not granted early temporary release except in the most exceptional circumstances.An Garda Síochána operates special foot and mobile patrols, targeting specific areas in response to identified local requirements.  All vehicles the subject of unauthorised takings are technically examined when recovered, and known offenders are targeted for these offences.  In each Garda division there is a traffic unit that targets incidents of joy-riding and enforcement outside of peak traffic hours.The Garda and local authorities have made good progress in recent years with regard to estate management and are actively reducing the opportunities for joy-riding.  For example, physical changes, such as barriers, speed ramps, in-fill housing, raising of plinth walls and widening of footpaths are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.  Gardaí are constantly liaising with community groups, and a number of projects are operating which have proved invaluable in dealing with offenders.Among these are a number of Garda youth diversion projects, which are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative seeking to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social and criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long term employability prospects.  By so doing, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhance the relations between the Gardaí and the community.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I have been informed by An Garda Síochána that a total of 822 firearms, 108 knives, 40 swords, 32 assorted offensive weapons and a quantity of ammunition were surrendered under the recent Weapons Amnesty.An extensive national awareness campaign was undertaken to promote the Amnesty.  The campaign included advertisements in the national and provincial newspapers and specialist publications together with a high visibility billboard campaign.  In addition 20,000 information leaflets were printed and circulated through Garda Stations throughout the country and a website was launched to provide extensive on-line information in relation to the Amnesty.The purpose of the Amnesty was to afford people an opportunity to surrender illegally held weapons before the introduction of the new mandatory minimum sentences provided for in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The new sentences, which came into effect on 1st November, 2006, provide for mandatory minimum sentences of between 5 and 10 years for a range of serious firearms offences.  These include: possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, max. sentence of life, mandatory min. sentence of 10 years; prohibition of use of firearms to resist arrest or aid escape, max. sentence of life, mandatory min. sentence of 10 years; possession of firearm while hijacking a  vehicle, max. sentence of 14 years, mandatory min. sentence of 5 years; possession of firearm in suspicious circumstances, max. sentence of 14 years, mandatory min. sentence of 5 years; carrying firearm with criminal intent, max. sentence of 14 years, mandatory min. sentence of 5 years; altering a Firearm, max. sentence of 10 years, mandatory min. sentence of 5 years.I want  to emphasise that I was never of the view that serious criminals were going to come into police stations and hand over their firearms.  However, I was satisfied there were people with guns and offensive weapons in their possession who might find it difficult to come forward or to admit that they had them in the house and that the amnesty would afford them an opportunity to surrender such weapons safely.  This indeed has proven to be the case.I am satisfied that the Amnesty has been very successful and fully achieved its aims.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	576	In August 2005, I received a submission from the Garda Commissioner on the resourcing requirements of An Garda Síochána.  The submission was based on the Commissioner's analysis of the policing challenges facing An Garda Síochána in the medium and longer term, including the implications of demographic change, the need to continue to combat crime and terrorist threats, and the requirements for enhanced enforcement of road traffic law and immigration control.  In the submission, the Commissioner proposed the future expansion of An Garda Síochána to 15,000 full time members.  He also proposed the expansion of the Garda overtime budget, the creation of a Garda Reserve and additional civilian support for An Garda Síochána.Strong action has been taken on the Commissioner's proposals.  The 2006 Garda overtime budget allocation has risen by €22.4million to €83.5million, an increase of 36.6% over the original allocation of €61.1m in 2005.  The Garda Reserve has been established, with the first group of recruits expected to complete their training later this month.  Significant progress is being made on providing additional civilian support at management level for An Garda Síochána.On the issue of an increase in the strength of An Garda Síochána to 15,000, the priority has been the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of An Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. This has involved a major redevelopment of the facilities at the Garda College, almost doubling its student capacity.As regards the future expansion of An Garda Síochána, I have asked the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to make any necessary recommendations for the more efficient deployment of Garda personnel and I can inform the Deputy that the Garda Síochána Inspectorate is currently undertaking an operational and administrative assessment of the Garda Síochána, including resource allocation and the deployment of Garda and civilian personnel. I have asked for an interim report from the Inspectorate on its assessment no later than end January 2007.  In the context of  the continuation of the existing accelerated Garda recruitment programme to achieve a Garda strength of 15,000 members, I intend to discuss this issue with my Government colleagues at that stage.

I again wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to continuing to implement all appropriate measures to prevent the possibility of such activity and to ensure that the prisoner's contact with the outside world is tightly controlled and monitored in an appropriate way.A number of measures have been implemented to prevent such activity.  These include: controlling and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons.  These visits are held in sight of prisoner officers and are monitored on CCTV; new visiting arrangements in most closed prisons.  Only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit and all visitors must provide identification; closed visit capability; incoming and outgoing mail is subject to examination by a prison censor; random searches of cells and their occupants; searching of correspondence and all other items entering the prison; searching of all persons committed to custody.  Searching also takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or after visits or on receipt of intelligence; a number of trial tests on modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities.  Initial tests indicate that these new technologies may be a valuable asset in the detection of contraband; phone detectors.  New hand-held metal detectors have been sourced and are in operation.  In addition, existing walk-through detectors in use in a number of institutions are being upgraded and extended to other institutions.The Deputy will also appreciate that the planned Prison Building Programme will make it more difficult for contraband items to get in to the prisons.

It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the DMR.Operation Anvil was extended nationwide during 2006 and consists of a series of special operations, proposed by each Regional Assistant Commissioner, which are designed to focus on areas where there is a high incidence of crime.The Operation outside the DMR is different from that in the DMR, in that initiatives have a short time-focus and are designed to address the particular needs of specific areas. A number of operations have been completed, while further operations are on-going. The methodologies utilised in doing this vary from area to area and from time to time, commensurate with the assessed need. For these reasons there is no comparable system in place for the systematic collation of statistical data in these Garda Regions.Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.The information requested in respect of the number of persons charged is not readily available as some of the incidents resulting in arrests are subject of ongoing investigations and this information could only be provided by a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources necessitating the examination of each individual incident and resultant arrest.In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to the extent and as long as the Commissioner considers that it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.The tables show the successes of Operation Anvil.NumberArrestsMurder56Burglary1,701Robbery offences796Serious assaults796Theft from shops*584Theft from MPV*66Theft other*129Total Arrests4,128Firearms Seized549* Figures commenced from 25 September 2006.NumberArrests2,595Firearms seized238

The vast majority of the removals involved persons who were refused refugee status in the State.Set out in the table are the yearly cost of removals of persons subject to either deportation or transfer orders since the commencement of the Immigration Act 1999 by scheduled/commercial and charter flights (including ferries in very limited circumstances for some Dublin II removals) for deportees/transferees and their Garda escorts.YearCost (Euros) of scheduled/commercial flight removals€199927,3552000429,57020011,080,60420021,187,62620031,569,81320041,797,52320051,725,7452006 (to 31 October)1,267,605Full total9,085,841The figures do not include the cost of overtime or subsistence payments for Garda escorts but do include the cost of 24 charter flights since 2002 at a total cost of €3,435,273 Euro.The deportation of illegal immigrants and refused asylum seekers is costly, particularly to distant countries such as Nigeria, China, etc.  In most cases removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.  In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice very near the date of departure which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.Also, in considering the costs of deportations, the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation orders has to be taken into account.  These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system.  This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.The total number of cases considered for deportation under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), since the commencement of the said Act and the results thereof are shown in Table A.YearNumber of deportation orders madeNumber of deportation orders effected19991016200094018820012,0253652002243052120032,41159120042,91559920051,8993962006(to 30 November)1,541289The majority of the cases referred to in the Table involve persons who claimed asylum but their claims were rejected.The total number of persons considered for transfer pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation and those removed are provided in Table B.YearDublin II Regulation Orders signedDublin II Regulation Orders effected20042386520054262092006

(to 30 November)148My Department's records show that, at present, there are circa 7,700 persons represented as evading Deportation Orders or Dublin II Regulation Transfer Orders, whose whereabouts are unknown to the Garda National Immigration Bureau. However, it is believed that most of these have already left the State. If, however, it is the case that any of these persons are still in the State, their presence here is illegal and they are therefore subject to arrest and detention for the purposes of their removal from the State.In a very significant number of cases, Deportation Orders have not been effected arising from challenges in the High Court by way of Judicial Review. There are, as of the end of November 2006, 476 ‘live' judicial review cases ongoing and the enforcement of Orders in these cases is generally suspended pending the outcome of such proceedings.As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the enforcement of Deportation Orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Following a review of the youth justice system the Government agreed, in December 2005, to a number of reforms including amendments to the Children Act 2001 (since provided under the Criminal Justice Act, 2006) and the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The issue of the accommodation of juvenile offenders in secure detention centres comes within the scope of these reforms.Currently, the Irish Prison Service has responsibility for 16 and 17 year old children who have been ordered to be detained by the Courts. The majority of these are male and detained in St. Patrick's Institution which accommodates 16 to 21 year old young people.  In addition, each of the prisons in the State can accommodate persons aged 17 years and over and the Courts currently have discretion to commit 17 year old young people directly to prison.  This can often happen at the request of the person's legal team in order for them to be located nearer to their family home. In the case of young female offenders a very small number of 17 year olds, one or two on average, are detained in the Dóchas Centre.The Irish Youth Justice Service has been established as an executive office of my Department and is to, inter alia, manage detention services for young people under the age of 18 years. The legislative, operational and administrative changes will see the transfer of responsibility for the detention of young offenders under 18 years of age, ordered to be detained by the Courts, from the Department of Education and Science and the Irish Prison Service to the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department. The net effect of these reforms to the detention services will be to end the practice of using adult prison places for the detention of children and to extend the children detention school model to all offenders, male and female,  under the age of 18 years. Interim arrangements are provided for in  the legislation in the case of males aged 16 and 17.The construction of children detention school places which can accommodate 16 and 17 year olds with the requisite facilities to provide care and education will take some time to complete.  In the interim,  work is well underway in St. Patrick's Institution for the separation of the majority of those under the age of 18 years from the older age groups.  The  Government has agreed to the recruitment of a National Manager for Detention School Services for the Irish Youth Justice Service and I understand that this appointment will be made shortly.  An expert group on children's detention  has also been formed to plan for the development of detention places. The transfer of the schools which are currently within the remit of the Department of Education and Science to  the aegis of the Irish Youth Justice Service will take place on the 1st of March, 2007.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The National Action Plan Against Racism (NPAR) was launched on 27 January, 2005 by the Taoiseach, myself and the Minister of State at my Department, Mr. Frank Fahey T.D.. The proposal for a National Action Plan Against Racism arose from a commitment at the UN World Conference Against Racism in South Africa in 2001 that each member state of the United Nations should develop and implement a national action plan. The Plan was also contained as a deliverable in the Special Initiative on ‘Migration and Inter-culturalism' in Sustaining Progress.The Plan is being implemented over a 4 year period (2005 — 2008). The emphasis is on "a whole of system approach" with particular emphasis on mainstreaming intercultural issues into formulation of public policy.  The Plan builds on the substantial equality infrastructure which is already in place.The Plan provides strategic direction to combat racism. It is based on policies that promote interaction, equality of opportunity, understanding and respect.I established a Strategic Monitoring Group, chaired by Ms Lucy Gaffney, to oversee implementation of the Plan. The membership of the Group is representative of the social partners, stakeholders such as An Garda Síochána, the Equality Authority, Irish Human Rights Commission, NCCRI and representatives of minority ethnic groups.  The Group progresses key issues of the plan and involves other stakeholders and experts from outside the Group for specific projects and expertise as the need arises.Among the activities undertaken which support the aims of the NPAR are the following:In January, 2006 the Commissioner, An Garda Síochána issued a Directive to every member of an Garda Síochána concerning the development of Garda strategies and services to meet the needs of a more diverse society. The Directive addressed a range of issues, including the following:protection against assaults, threatening behaviour and incitement to hatredresponding to victims of racially motivated incidentsdevelopment of consultation processes with ethnic minority communities.recording of racist incidents on the PULSE system.the procedures for a consultation process with ethnic minority communities at Garda District, Divisional and National level.the recruitment of ethnic minorities to An Garda Síochána.In the Education sector a number of intercultural projects are underway. The NCCA have produced intercultural guidelines for teachers in primary and post primary schools.  Under the NPAR funding has been provided (€50,000) to assist the roll-out of primary guidelines in schools and will similarly assist with post-primary guidelines. The Department of Education and Science is also in consultation with the National Youth Council in connection with the development of an intercultural Strategy for youth work. In relation to the third level sector, the National Access Office for Higher Education, within the Higher Education Authority, is also exploring ways to progress the ‘intercultural campus' with a number of third level institutions.An Intercultural Strategy for the Health Service is also in the course of preparation. A consultation process is underway and a conference is planned on the matter for next April.Roundtable discussion with the media on the topic of the reporting of  racism and diversity issues was held on 14 November, 2005. The concept of a Press Ombudsman and Press Council of Ireland, launched on the 5th December 2006, by the Press Industry Planning Committee includes in its code of practice certain principles to be observed by journalists to avoid incitement to hatred.A number of ‘Anti-racism and Diversity' Plans (ARDs) are underway. Galway City was the first to develop such a plan and funding has been provided for ARDs in Roscommon, the Dublin Inner City, Fingal, Louth and Dún Laoghaire Rathdown.Research has also been commissioned into ‘racism and the criminal law'. This is being carried out by the Law School, University of Limerick and is due for completion in early 2007.The Strategic Monitoring Group is also supporting a Research Initiative on Considerations for Neighbourhood Planning, Housing provision and Estate Management Policy arising from the increased cultural diversity in Ireland. The research will scope key issues arising in public and private housing and the implications for planning future housing policy and estate management. The research will be targeted at specific local authority areas. Research partners will include my own Department, the Departments of Environment Heritage and Local Government, NCCRI, and representatives from the NPAR Strategic Monitoring Group.Under the NPAR €275,000 has been provided to sports clubs and societies to address issues of racism. The Irish Sports Council and their Local Sporting Partnerships, recently disbursed grants totalling €349,000 to encourage migrants to participate in sporting activities through mainstream sporting structures.The Department has been actively involved in supporting the development of an intercultural strategy for soccer with the FAI and has provided funding to employ consultants to draw up such a strategy. Two other sporting national governing bodies are also at an advanced stage of committing to developments in this area.The Strategic Monitoring Group in its efforts to engage the corporate sector held a corporate breakfast for the CEOs of Ireland's top companies on 28 October 2005 in the Burlington Hotel.The Strategic Monitoring Group, the Equality Authority and the Irish Management Institute (IMI) have agreed to establish a BIZLAB model to promote the business case for diversity through research, to explore and identify the primary issues in management of cultural diversity and, establish a business case for investment in diversity management.This year is the seventh year of the Anti-Racist Workplace Week. It raises awareness of the need to combat racism in organisations and promote support for the accommodation of diversity in the workplace. The week is organised by the Equality Authority and is supported by the Strategic Monitoring Group which provided €50,000 towards the event this year and in 2005.At the end of October, 2006 the Group launched the results of an attitudinal survey on migration to Ireland updating the findings of a similar survey carried out in 2003. The results of the survey are extremely encouraging.In early 2007, the Strategic Monitoring Group will embark on a major national awareness media campaign building on the success of its national radio campaign in early 2006 and emphasising the positives of our diverse society.I think the House would agree that there is a general sense of optimism for the future with the conditions as set out in the recent NESC report, that immigration is managed, that there is increased efforts to promote integration and language teaching and that immigrants themselves make efforts to adapt to Irish society and to integrate.I am sure that the Deputy will agree that this is a solid body of work undertaken by the Strategic Monitoring Group in a short period of time and I commend the Chair, Ms. Lucy Gaffney, and her partners on the Group for the efforts to date. I would also like to mention that the Committee for the UN Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (UNCERD), has regularly praised the State for its work in developing and implementing a national action plan against racism. It regards Ireland as a ‘pioneer and example of good practice'.Since my announcement of a special €5m Integration Fund to help integrate legally-resident immigrants, my Department has established a variety of schemes and initiatives for its effective dispersal. A total of €2m has been allocated to local partnerships working on locally-based initiatives and a further €1m to national and regional NGOs working in the relevant area. The funding is being distributed through Pobal who are at an advanced stage of project selection with final decisions expected shortly. A further €1m (approx.) is being used to accelerate the implementation of the National Action Plan against Racism across a range of projects.  It is expected that specific project allocations will be made by the end of the year.The balance of the Fund, of  €1m (approx.), will be used to implement a wide range of initiatives being managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) which is now part of the new Irish  Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.  As with the Pobal and NPAR aspects of the fund, the selection of detailed projects are, in the main, currently being finalised and decisions are expected over the next few weeks. The  projects being funded include the following:Ongoing processes and initiatives associated with the increased quota of resettlement refugeesInternational cooperation on selected refugee issuesA "small grants" scheme (up to €15,000 per project) for integration initiatives being managed by RIAResearch  on the development of a national English language policy for newcomers.Research on an effective approach to language interpretation for newcomersFinal project funding details will be made public as soon as they are available.

This expansion will continue until all organisations which recruit persons to work in a substantial, unsupervised capacity with children and vulnerable adults can avail of the Garda Síochána's vetting service.In this regard, expansion has already occurred to, inter alia, the primary and post-primary education sectors, the youth work sector and a range of health and social services sectors.In respect of the childcare sector, the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is ready to commence expansion of its vetting service, on a phased basis, to all such service providers from early 2007, subject to agreement on appropriate liaison mechanisms for the sector, including the identification of a sectoral central point of contact to manage vetting applications and disclosures thereon.With regard to institutional care homes, the GCVU has registered and trained the sector and vetting has now been extended to each such home.Finally, the current processing time within the GCVU in respect of valid vetting applications is less than four weeks.

At the time,  I indicated that processing of the applications has commenced and that the files will be presented to me for a decision in the near future.This remains the position.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	588	The figures for public order offences, where proceedings commenced, in each Garda Region are available in the relevant Garda Annual Reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library.I can inform the Deputy that strong provisions are in place to combat public order problems including anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  The Act provides for the making of exclusion orders on individuals to prohibit that person from entering or being in the vicinity of specified premises between such times, and during such a period, as the Court may specify.  The Act also provides for the making of closure orders on specified premises, requiring that premises to close at a specified time or between specified times on a specified day or days during a specified period.  A closure order may also require a premises to close for a maximum of 7 days in respect of a first order or for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 30 days in respect of a second order.Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.More recently, I brought forward additional provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to deal with public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  In relation to public order offences, Section 184 amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to lesser public order offences as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance.  Section 185 of the 2006 Act amends section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order Act) 1994 to make it an offence to assault or threaten or to impede medical personnel in a hospital, people assisting such personnel or a peace officer acting in the course of duty.  The definition of ‘peace officer' is expanded to include members of the fire brigade and ambulance personnel.In the case of anti-social behaviour the Act empowers a senior member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Act introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the courts.The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 on anti-social behaviour by adults will be commenced on 1 January, 2007 and those on anti-social behaviour by children on 1 March, 2007, following the consultations required under the Act between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements so as to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Further to my Reply to Question No. 121 on Thursday 23 November 2006, I am advised by An Garda Síochána of the following details.In performing his or her functions under the Immigration Act, 2004, an Immigration Officer is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 2004, to have regard to all the circumstances of the non-national concerned made known to the officer, or represented to the officer, by him or her. On arrival in the State, non-nationals are obliged, pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 2004, to present to an Immigration Officer for the purpose of making an application to land in the State. Every person landing in the State is obliged, pursuant to Section 11 (2) of the aforesaid Act, to furnish to an Immigration Officer such information in such manner as an Immigration Officer may reasonably require for the purposes of the performance of his or her functions. The person concerned failed to comply with requests for further information made by the Immigration Officer in this case.The specifics of the case are as follows.  On 2 October 2006 the person referred to by the Deputy landed at Dublin Airport having travelled on board an Air France flight from Paris. She approached the Immigration Control at Pier C and presented a Portuguese passport. On examination of this passport the Immigration Officer was not satisfied that the person handing it to him was the same person whose photograph was contained in the document. As a consequence of this assessment by the Immigration Officer, he refused the person concerned permission to land in the State.  The Immigration Officer was not satisfied that the person seeking such permission was in possession of a valid passport, or other equivalent document, issued by, or on behalf of, an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes her identity and nationality. The person concerned was informed, in writing, of the grounds for her refusal of leave to land.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána as at 5 December 2006 was 12,990 (all ranks). In addition to the above, there are currently 1,127 Student Gardaí. It is projected that 1,100 new Garda Students will commence training at the Garda College next year.The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the Garda specialist unit tasked with the role of tackling organised crime. It carries out this role by conducting intelligence-driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units including the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau. In November 2005 Garda management allocated an additional 55 officers to the Organised Crime Unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to augment the effort to target groups involved in organised crime in the Dublin Metropolitan Region. The unit is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent and works closely with Gardaí deployed on "Operation Anvil" and with other specialist units.These resources augment the unit's already in place and target organised criminal gangs on an ongoing basis. There have been successes in relation to many of these gangs where they have been arrested and charged with serious crimes and are now awaiting trial.An Garda Síochána employs a range of techniques in the fight against serious and organised crime.  The establishment of specialist Garda units, operating under the Assistant Commissioner in charge of National Support Services, has enabled An Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively.The level of resources available is kept under review by Garda Management to ensure they are in a position to tackle trends and developments as they become evident.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the ten crime classifications used to show the more serious crimes (headline offences) were first introduced in the Garda Síochána Annual Report of 2000.The Deputy will be aware that, with respect to the year 2000, the Garda Síochána changed the system of crime presentation as part of the PULSE information technology project.  Specifically, the changeover to the PULSE platform allowed the Gardaí to reorganise its crime classification system, so that it more accurately reflects the complex, modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda Síochána.The previous crime classifications and sub-categorisations, based essentially on the distinction between indictable and non-indictable offences, were many decades old and were becoming increasingly unsuitable.PULSE proved a considerable improvement in this respect, and the new classification of headline offences contains ten sub-divisions which offer a comprehensive description of modern criminal activity in a much more readily understandable form.Classification changes, to reflect the introduction of new legislation, were made in 2002. Changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which required a minor change to Group 6 Larcenies, by changing the name of the offences from Larceny to Theft Offences.The introduction of this Act required greater change to Group 9, Fraud where the offences of Embezzlement and False Pretences were repealed by the Act of 2001. Four new classifications were created to replace the Falsification of Accounts/Companies Offences. Three new offences, European Communities Fraud, Counterfeiting Notes and Coins, and Possession of Article (Fraud), were included in Group 9, Fraud.Coinage offences were removed from Group 10, Other Headline Offences, but replaced with a new classification, Counterfeiting Notes and Coins, in Group 9, Fraud.The removal of Coinage Offences had no statistical impact as no offences had been recorded since the introduction of the new headline groups in 2000.In 2003 a new crime classification, Criminal Assets Bureau Offences, was added to Group 9, Fraud.In 2005 two new headline offences were added. Sexual Offenders Act Offences were added to Group 3, Sexual Offences and Employer Permit (Employer) Offences were added to Group 10, Other Headline Offences.Reclassification of crime is due, primarily, to the introduction of new legislation which creates new offences or repeals old ones.  Any changes to the crime classifications are identified in the Garda Síochána Annual Report of the relevant year.Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation, production and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO established a dedicated Unit for this purpose.The CSO published the reported crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 on 27 October, 2006 marking the formal transfer for the published crime statistics from the Gardaí to the CSO. The figures released by the CSO did not involve any change in the methodology from that used by the Garda authorities in the production of quarterly headline crime statistics.The CSO has established an Advisory Group to assist it in the development of crime and criminal justice statistics. One of the first tasks of the Advisory Group will be to review current methodology and to make recommendations for the development and presentation of crime statistics. In particular it will involve examination of:the distinction between headline and non-headline offences;the impact of the counting rules used where there are multiple offences involved in the one crime incident; andthe development of a new robust classification of offences/incidents to be used in the future.This review, which is to be informed by best practice in other countries, will better align crime statistics with public and specialist user needs. This element of the work of the Group should be completed in the first half of 2007.The CSO is also preparing to develop a more integrated and comprehensive system of crime statistics on crime and victimisation. This will include offences which do not necessarily come to the attention of the Gardaí as well as offences that are often under reported to the Gardaí.Finally, the CSO is giving consideration to the development of statistics on the wider criminal justice system to include the courts, prisons and probation services.

There is no question of there being any deficiency in the resources, equipment and personnel available to the Gardaí in pursuit of this priority.I wish to inform the Deputy that as proof of the Government's commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime, a record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, is being made available to An Garda Síochána this year.This commitment is also evidenced by the fact that the allocation for the Garda Vote for 2007 is up by €135.3m to €1.445 billion — an increase of 10% on this year's allocation and is also shown by the fact that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána made up of the number of attested Gardaí plus recruits in training now stands at a record high of over 14,000. This demonstrates that the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government to recruit an additional 2,000 members of An Garda Síochána has been met.The Deputy will appreciate that policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda authorities. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.However, I am, of course, in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review. The overall allocation of Garda resources, including manpower, to the Garda Commissioner reflects the Government's policing priorities (including combating drug trafficking) and An Garda Síochána has never in its history been better resourced.Furthermore, I can assure the House that drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework, our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.In relation to this, An Garda Síochána invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following;Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this stateConducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs tradeWorking in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.The Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU), in conjunction with other specialist Garda units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau, continues to undertake "targeted specific" operations against the larger illegal drug importation and distribution operations.The GNDU also works closely with divisional and district drug units in detecting and preventing the sale and supply of illegal drugs. It provides assistance and expertise to these local units in operational, intelligence and training matters. Divisional and district drug units operate in divisions throughout the country and their primary focus is to target local dealers and users. Where necessary, these resources can be supplemented by other Garda personnel operating at local level. All Gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to deal with drug related issues as they arise.There is also targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in drugs activity.In addition, the Organised Crime Unit, established in November 2005, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Gardaí, continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.These operations, which are ongoing, continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade and significant drug seizures continue to be made as a result of this work.Indeed, one of the key performance indicators for our law enforcement authorities under the National Drugs Strategy is to increase drug seizures by 25% by 2004 and 50% by 2008, using the 2000 seizures figures as a baseline and An Garda Síochána continues to achieve considerable successes in relation to this objective.The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international level will continue to be vigilantly monitored by An Garda Síochána.

This was backed up with certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.The Witness Security Programme was established because of the rise in the criminal activities of organised crime groups, which increasingly attempt to corrupt and destroy the normal functioning of the criminal justice system by all possible means, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation or elimination of witnesses.Protecting vulnerable witnesses has thus become a primary duty for States to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of their criminal justice systems and the continued safety and well being of their citizens.

In addition a number of money laundering schemes have been uncovered during Garda investigations into serious and organised criminal groupings.I am further informed that the Money Laundering Investigation Unit (MLIU) at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has primary responsibility for the investigation of money laundering offences in this jurisdiction, while the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is charged with depriving criminals and their networks of assets derived from criminal activity.  A dedicated unit has been established within the Garda National Drugs Unit to investigate the financial aspects of drug-trafficking and money laundering.In the past five years the MLIU have taken actions under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 concerning sums of money totalling €4.2 million.  A sum of €200,000 has been confiscated for the benefit of the State and proceedings are ongoing in relation to the remainder of these monies.In addition, CAB using its civil powers, and further to its statutory remit, forwarded in excess of €18.5 million to the Central Exchequer in 2005.  In the period 2001 to 2004 CAB, utilising revenue powers, collected taxes totalling €54 million.It is also worth noting that in the past twelve months the investigation unit of the Garda National Drugs Unit has taken action under the restraint and cash detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 on sums of money totalling €1.52 million.All Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) made to the Money Laundering Investigation Unit of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation are investigated in full in an attempt to link the subject or funds to any form of criminal activity.  A number of STR investigations are also referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau annually for further investigation.

The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137.The strength of the Garda Síochána has been substantially increased since 1997.  In June 1997 the Force strength, excluding trainees, stood at 10,702. The personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána, excluding trainees, increased to a record 13,000 on 16 November 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.The Garda Budget for 2006 stands at €1.3 billion, which represents a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.  In addition to expenditure on operations, these resources are also being used to provide required facilities.  Most recently, significant property has been purchased in Tipperary to provide a major tactical and practical training centre for the Force.  This will enable a broad range of training facilities to be developed.The current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.In October 2004, I announced that I was proceeding with the Government's promise to recruit 2,000 additional Gardaí over the life of the Government and an implementation plan to achieve that expansion was drawn up in consultation with the Commissioner.That plan envisaged a recruiting strategy that would see the combined strength of the Force reaching some 14,044 Gardaí (including trainees) by the end of 2006.  The overall strength of the Force, including recruits in training is now in fact some 14,137.  So, we have delivered on our target well ahead of schedule.Recruitment 2004-2008Year EndingNew Entrant IntakeTotal (including trainees)Total (excluding trainees)200452312,74312,22020051,09613,38812,29220061,09614,04412,94820071,09714,62713,530200866114,66114,000I have always said that phased increase in the strength of An Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006, with a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008.  The expansion of the Garda Síochána is fully on target. Since the first quarter of 2005, it was planned to induct approximately 275 recruits to the Garda Training College each quarter.  In actual fact, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005 and a further 1,114 were inducted this year. And it is planned to induct a further 1,100 recruits in 2007 which will result in a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008.  The project to deliver on this commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government is fully on target and will be achieved.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that there is currently no proposal to provide a separate Garda division for the entire County of Kildare. The personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 281(all ranks). The personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 6 December, 2006 was 371 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 90 (or 32%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I can inform the Deputy that strong provisions are in place to combat public order problems including anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  The Act provides for the making of exclusion orders on individuals to prohibit that person from entering or being in the vicinity of specified premises between such times, and during such a period, as the Court may specify.  The Act also provides for the making of closure orders on specified premises, requiring that premises to close at a specified time or between specified times on a specified day or days during a specified period.  A closure order may also require a premises to close for a maximum of 7 days in respect of a first order or for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 30 days in respect of a second order.Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.More recently, I brought forward additional provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to deal with public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  In relation to public order offences, Section 184 amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to lesser public order offences as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance.  Section 185 of the 2006 Act amends section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order Act) 1994 to make it an offence to assault or threaten or to impede medical personnel in a hospital, people assisting such personnel or a peace officer acting in the course of duty.  The definition of ‘Peace Officer' is expanded to include members of the fire brigade and ambulance personnel.In the case of anti-social behaviour the Act empowers a senior member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Act introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the courts.The provisions on anti-social behaviour of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced soon, following the consultations required under the Act between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. These consultations are currently ongoing. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.

This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service.

A non visa required national legally resident in the State on student conditions can seek to change their status to allow them enter employment.There are two main ways by which a non visa required national can take up employment, work permit and work authorisation.  Work Authorisation is a scheme which covers highly specialised areas of the economy requiring a high level of skill and educational achievement —  for example, the high-tech, medical, and engineering sectors. The criteria for issuing Work Authorisations changes regularly, according to the demands of the economy.  The second option open to the person concerned, if they do not qualify for a Work Authorisation is for a prospective employer in Ireland to apply for a Work Permit in respect of them.Work Permits and Authorisations are issued by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment who will be in a position to provide information as to the current status of these programmes.Should a visa required national wish to take up employment, they must first leave the State and apply for the appropriate visa.  However, should the offer of employment directly relate to the qualification obtained from the course of studies, a change of status within the State may be considered by their Immigration Officer.  It would also follow  that a prospective employer must apply to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to obtain a Work Permit or Work Authorisation on the person's behalf.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.Long term residency is granted on the basis that a non EEA national has completed five years (60 months) legal residence in the State on Work Permit conditions which is reflected in the corresponding Stamp 1 endorsements in a person's passport  and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each Work Permit. Subsequently, in calculating the reckonable period of 60 months legal residence, the Immigration Division of my Department only takes into consideration time spent in the State legally on work permit conditions.  However, periods of time, where a person has not had legal residence (i.e.: having an up to date endorsement on Work Permit conditions in their passport) cannot be counted towards an application for long term residency.The Immigration Division has no record of having any application from the person concerned pending for 12 months.  On foot of representations received on the 26th April 2006 and a Parliamentary Question put down for answer on the 6th July 2006 (PQ 28110/06) the Immigration Division contacted the person concerned in writing requesting documentation in support of the application.  The application was considered under the criteria for long term residency and a decision was made to refuse the application as he did not have the required residency.However, in light of the particular circumstances, he was granted permission to remain in the State on the 24th October 2006 for a 4 month period to allow a prospective employer obtain a work permit on his behalf.    He was also advised that in the event that a work permit was not obtained on his behalf, he should contact the Immigration Division to enable them review his case further.  Enquiries made with the Garda National Immigration Bureau indicate that the person concerned has recently regularised his immigration status in line with the permission to remain granted, as outlined above.

After Budget 2007, elderly earners aged 65 or over may earn €19,000, if single, or €38,000, if married, without having any liability for income tax.  Above these limits a system of marginal relief applies.  The limits compare very favourably with the entry points to taxation for earners aged under 65 of €17,600 for a single person, €26,400 for a married one-earner couple without dependent children and €35,200 for a married two earner couple.Where elderly earners cannot benefit from the age exemption limits because their income is above a level where the limits would be of benefit, such earners are entitled to the age tax credit which, after Budget 2007, stands at €275 for a single person and €550 for a married couple. The age credit applies in addition to their basic personal credits.  I have no plans to introduce a special tax band for pensioners as suggested by the Deputy.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	606	Section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) Consolidation Act 2003 provides an exemption from CAT, in certain circumstances, for persons who acquire their family home by way of gift or inheritance.  The relief was introduced in order to reduce the tax burden faced by individuals on receipt of the family home.  The relief does not apply a threshold to the value of property that is being transferred.In order to qualify for the relief, the beneficiary (i.e the person receiving the gift or inheritance) must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the gift or inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling house at the time of acquisition/inheritance.  In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the gift/inheritance.  These conditions were included in the legislation in order to restrict the relief to genuine cases and avoid the relief being used as a means of tax avoidance.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the individual concerned would not qualify for relief under Section 86 as the individual has an interest in another property.However, the CAT code includes group thresholds, below which no CAT is liable.  Disposals from a parent to a child are exempt from CAT up to the value of €478,155.  This threshold is increased on an annual basis in accordance with the CSO Consumer Price Index.  Any other gifts/inheritance that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 are also taken into account when applying the thresholds for the purposes of calculating CAT.  If the total value of all inheritances and gifts received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% CAT will apply on the difference.  In this regard, where the individual referred to by the Deputy has not received any other gifts or inheritances from his or her parents, he/she will only be liable to inheritance tax on the value of the property above €478,155.

Individuals aged 18 and over who were resident in the State could open an SSIA account and in the case of a married couple, both spouses could open their own accounts.  However, the SSIA rules do not deal specifically with the issue raised by the Deputy.  Rather there are specific provisions in general law in relation to the administration of an estate of a deceased person, and these must be followed before the assets of the estate can be distributed. The funds in the SSIA account constitute an asset of the estate of the deceased person. The net assets of the estate are distributed to the beneficiaries by the executors or administrators following grant of probate or of letters of administration.On the death of an individual, his/her SSIA account is treated as maturing.  In the case of an SSIA that was a deposit account from which no withdrawals had been made up until date of death, the capital invested by the SSIA account holder, together with the Government contribution, remains the property of the deceased individual's estate and are not taxed.

Section 469(5) provides that where health expenses are incurred in one year but not paid until a following year, an individual has the option to claim health expenses tax relief either in the year in which the expense was incurred or in the year in which payment in respect of such expense was made.  However, where an individual incurs health expenses in a tax year and pays for such expense in that year, any claim for health expenses must relate to that year.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the circumstances described by the Deputy, that is, where the individual incurred and paid for qualifying medical or dental treatment in two separate tax years but paid tax in only one of those years, the individual would not be entitled to tax relief in respect of the health expense incurred and paid for in the first year.  However, the person would be entitled to claim tax relief in respect of health expenses incurred and paid in the second year.Health expenses relief is generally provided by way of repayment of tax paid and only to the extent that tax has been paid.  Where a person has paid for qualifying health expenses but has not paid tax in a year, it is not possible to provide relief under the scheme to him or her.  I have no plans at present to change this position.

The section that the Commissioners are responsible for is maintained in proper repair and effective condition, as required by the Act.  No works were deemed necessary or carried out by the Commissioners in the past ten months in that section.  The Commissioners have not carried out any works in the area where the flooding occurred and have no power at present to do so.Office of Public Works engineers visited the area on Monday of this week and collected data from Mayo County Council officials and local residents that will help to establish the cause of the flooding.  Further meetings of officials will take place, commencing this week, to identify possible measures to reduce future flood risk and potential mechanisms to implement any such measures.

A number of sites were considered.  In 2002 a suitable site was identified at Station Road, Leixlip.  Site acquisition was completed in October 2002.  Additional land adjacent to the Station Road site was sought from Kildare County Council to facilitate increases in Garda accommodation requirements.  In May 2005 agreement was reached with Kildare County Council to transfer this plot of land to OPW.Following approval of the revised sketch scheme by the Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform, the Part 9 consultation began in December 2005.  The Commissioners of Public Works appointed an independent assessor to consider the 98 submissions received in response to the Part 9 notice.  In September 2006 the Commissioners made a formal decision to proceed with the construction of the station.  Tenders have been issued.  It is expected that construction will commence on site early next year and completion will be mid 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	618	In 2006, total health funding is €13.147 billion, which represents an underlying increase of 12.04% over 2005.  The vast bulk of this funding is provided under the vote of the Health Service Executive which has statutory responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. This continuing high level of investment by the Government provides the Executive with considerable capacity to address the health care needs of the population in the most effective manner.Funding for all health services has been provided as part of the Executive's overall vote for health and personal social services in 2006.  The allocation of resources in the case raised by the Deputy is a matter for the Executive to be determined within the overall priorities for particular services set out by me in the Budget.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

The Marine Institute informed the Department on 7th November that they had forwarded these suspect samples to the Central European Laboratory (CRL) INFREMER, La Tremblade, France, for further analysis.The Department, acting on the advice of the Marine Institute, immediately put in place procedures to restrict movements of shellfish from Lough Swilly on a precautionary basis, which will now be given permanent effect. As a result of further confirmatory testing the Marine Institute informed the Department definitively of the presence of Bonamia ostreae in Lough Swilly on 23 November 2006.  Following consultation with the Marine Institute and Seafood Control the Department has now forwarded guidelines on best practise to all operators within Lough Swilly.

As I indicated on that occasion, I am aware of, and deeply concerned by, the shooting of Tibetan refugees which occurred at the Tibet-Nepal border on 30 September. The issue has specifically been raised with the Chinese authorities by the EU. The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns with China about individual human rights cases, and more general issues such as freedom of expression and the abolition of the death penalty. The latest round of the Dialogue was held in Beijing on 19 October. Senior officials from both sides discussed a wide range of human rights issues including this specific incident.The EU expressed deep concern about these events and urged China to investigate the incident thoroughly. We continue to have serious concerns about the Chinese explanation of the event, which does not appear compatible with the testimony of independent eyewitnesses or video footage of the event. I believe it is important that China seek to establish and address the full facts of the incident. Ireland, with our EU partners, will continue to follow up the matter closely with the Chinese authorities.On a bilateral level, the Government has consistently called on the Chinese authorities to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people, including their socio-economic and human rights. I met with Chinese foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing during a visit to Beijing in May. During our meeting, I had the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

However, it should be noted that students attending recognised programmes of study are entitled to work twenty hours per week during term time and forty hours per week during holidays without, at present, the need for a work permit.In the aftermath of EU Enlargements, it is Government policy that employers should be able to source nearly all of their workforce needs from within the EU. Accordingly, only in cases where exceptional levels of skill and qualifications are needed for the job, and the employer has made meaningful attempts to find EEA nationals first, will my Department now consider work permit applications.

This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, top assist, for example in cases of flood damage where immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter, of the people affected may be met by a UNP in cash or in kind.My Department's role in supporting the response to this particular flooding event will primarily involve supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding.My Department has been in contact with the local representatives of the community welfare service in order to ascertain the immediate and long term effects of the flooding in this case. The local community welfare officer has visited the area and is available to provide assistance on an individual basis, where that is warranted.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	635	The state pension (transition), previously known as the retirement pension, is a social insurance payment made to persons aged 65 who entered social insurance at least 10 years before reaching pension age, who paid a minimum number of PRSI contributions at the appropriate rate and who achieved a minimum yearly average contribution rate over their working lives.In addition to satisfying the relevant contribution conditions, those qualifying for a state pension (transition) must be retired from employment. Retirement is defined as meaning that a person is not engaged in an employment which is insurable employment or insurable self-employment, other than an employment which is insurable for occupational injuries benefit only. For employees, coverage for occupational injuries only is linked to a threshold of earnings, currently set at €38 per week. Similarly, self-employed workers are not entitled to state pension (transition) unless they have income of less than €3,174 per annum.An increase in the employee insurability threshold would remove full social insurance cover from a large number of employees who are not retired and are working part time and on low earnings.There are no plans at present to alter the arrangements with regard to entitlement to state pension (transition), nor the income thresholds related to insurability, but the matter is being kept under review.

Persons in receipt of an unemployment payment for 9 months may pursue a third level course if they are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process.Lone parents and persons in receipt of an unemployment payment can participate in the scheme if they are between 18 to 20 years of age and out of formal education for at least 2 years.  This provision is subject to satisfying the qualifying period in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment.The back to education allowance is a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme. The allowance is not payable in addition to another social welfare payment.The allowance also has a number of other features attaching to it. It is payable for the duration of the course of study, which in the case of lone parents includes all holiday periods.  The scheme itself is not means tested and, consequently, lone parents may take up part-time employment during the academic year and full-time employment during the summer period without affecting their payment.  In addition, participants receive a cost of education allowance of €400 which is payable at the beginning of each academic year.  Participants may also retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they had while in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment that qualified them for participation in the scheme.

Of the Aggregate Amount, Dublin Port will receive €138,427,632, being 33.6% thereof, in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement as announced on 29 June, 2006. The balance of €273,559,368, less certain deductions (described below and currently estimated at between €19 million and €21.5 million), will be paid on a proportionate basis as Cash Consideration to the South Wharf Shareholders at the Scheme Record Time.In response to the Deputy's second question, South Wharf did not acquire the site on which the Irish Glass Bottle Company was located. South Wharf owns the leasehold interest in the site, while Dublin Port Company owns the freehold interest. In June 2006, the two parties reached an agreement to sell both their interests. Again, the details of this agreement were disclosed in a company announcement from South Wharf to the Irish Stock Exchange on 30 June 2006, headlined ‘Agreement re Ringsend Site'. This announcement is also available on the ISE website.

The number of participants on a county basis is set out in the table.Participants in receipt of One ParentFamily Benefit, Disability Allowance and Widow's/Widower's Pension receive a top-up payment under the RSS.  However, the Deputy should note that this payment is in addition their weekly social welfare payment which they continue to receive while on the Scheme. The RSS is also recognised as a qualifying payment for the purpose of assessing entitlement to certain secondary benefits, such as medical card, fuel allowance, back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  The entitlement of RSS participants to such secondary benefits is, of course, a matter for the relevant paying authority i.e. the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive.Participants on the Scheme, who are in receipt of the benefits/allowances referred to above, are receiving a total weekly payment appropriate to their circumstances, as determined by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.CountyParticipantCarlow14Cavan81Clare115Cork168Donegal229Galway270Kerry279Kildare22Kilkenny19Laois25Leitrim100Limerick75Longford56Louth10Mayo574Meath15Monaghan38Offaly47Offshore Islands15Roscommon146Sligo122Tipperary66Waterford11Westmeath34Wexford43Wicklow19Total2,593

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	649	As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The Strategy, which was launched in May 2001, is based on four pillars  — supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research — under which a series of 100 individual actions have been identified.  These actions are being carried out by a number of  Departments and Agencies.My Department contributes fully to the overall aim of the Government's policy in relation to drugs, which is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. As part of this process, my Department is represented at senior level on the National Drugs Strategy Team and on the Interdepartmental Group which in turn reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. In addition, my Department is represented on all Drugs Task Forces, both Local and Regional.Drug prevention education is implemented as part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curricula in primary and post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum is mandatory in all primary schools and post-primary schools up to Junior Certificate Level in which substance use is one of 10 modules taught.The Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP), through its SPHE Cuiditheoireacht service from September 2003 provides support for the implementation of SPHE in schools and for the formulation of Substance Use Policies through school visits. Further support and guidance in this area is available through the provision of ‘Drop in' clinics in various Education Centres around the country. Furthermore, the SPHE trainers provided half-day seminars for designated members of teaching staffs in primary schools and parents — in non-Local Drugs Task Force Areas — to help them formulate Substance Use Policies; the trainers also facilitated evening meetings for Substance Use Policy Committees. A callsave helpline is also provided for information and advice on the topic.The Substance Misuse Prevention Programme (SMPP or ‘The Walk Tall' Programme) is a national programme, established in 1996, to provide in-service to teachers in primary schools in the area of legal and illegal substances. The programme teaching and resource materials focus on both alcohol and drugs in an age appropriate manner.The programme has an integrated approach to drug education and is a key strategy in drug abuse prevention education. Teaching and resource materials developed by the ‘Walk Tall' Programme are made available to all primary and special schools nationally. In the last academic year the Walk Tall Support Service produced a CD ROM of the programme materials and a handbook for teachers "Understanding Substances and Substance Use" and made it available to all schools nationally. Summer training courses are offered nationally to teachers. Courses took place in Limerick, Kildare, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Louth, Carrick-on Shannon, Mayo, Wicklow, Tipperary, Monaghan, Cavan and Tralee.The support service has a full time staff of three, comprised of a national support officer and two assistants on secondment from teaching duties. A part-time panel of approximately 20 teachers is available to deliver summer training courses nationally.In addition, the programme currently offers a dedicated support service to all schools in the 14 Local Drugs Task Force Areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork.At post-primary level, the substance misuse prevention programme ‘On My Own Two Feet' which is an integral part of the SPHE curriculum, draws on three approaches: knowledge-attitude, decision-making and social competence. As such it is a comprehensive life-skills programme.All post-primary schools are invited to in-service training in SPHE each spring and autumn on a regional basis. A selection of SPHE topics are offered to teachers, including substance use education. Health Promotion Officers and Regional Development Officers along with experts in specific areas, such as substance use education are involved in the delivery of this in-service. In addition, there is a dedicated Regional Development Officer who works with post-primary schools in the Local Drugs Task Force Areas, in assisting them with policy development and implementation of the policy guidelines on substance use in schools.My Department has also taken a number of initiatives to counteract substance misuse in schools, including alcohol. In October 2002, my Department issued guidelines to all schools to assist them in the development of School Substance Use Policies. These guidelines were developed in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the then Health Boards. The central objective of a school's substance use policy is the welfare, care and protection of every young person in line with the Education Act, 1998 and the Education Welfare Act, 2000.The policy is intended to address both education concerning alcohol, tobacco, drugs and other dangerous substances and the procedures for managing incidents relating to them.In addition, my Department currently funds 36 mainstreamed Local Drug Task Force projects at a cost of over €3 million.I am confident that together these initiatives are ensuring that the education system plays its role in combating drug abuse among young people. Clearly, however, this issue requires action on many fronts. To this end, we will continue to work with other Departments on the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	650	My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in the case of secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1978/79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.The 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. In addition to the €12 per pupil increase in 2006 in the standard per capita grant that now stands at €298 per pupil, voluntary secondary schools have benefited additionally by the increase of €14 per pupil in 2006 in the support services grant bringing the overall grant to €159 per pupil.I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates. From 1 January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 to €316 per pupil. In addition, the support services grant will be increased by a further €30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to €189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of €48 per pupil will bring the aggregate grant to over €500 per pupil from 1 January next. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this will bring annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €290,000.The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2007 estimates, for these significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I acknowledge the important work undertaken by our school principals. Some principals have particularly heavy workloads arising from the size of their school. Others carry additional duties arising from the fact that, in addition to their mainstream classes, they have a significant number of special classes containing children with complex special needs. We are also establishing specialist autism units in schools where the principal is a teaching principal.I am responding to these needs by the introduction of the following new measures that I announced on 12 November, 2006:The allocation of additional teachers to allow Deputy Principals in mainstream schools that, in addition to their ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with the more complex, low incidence, special needs, to operate as Administrative Deputy Principals.Where a school has a Principal and four or five mainstream class teachers also has a specialist autism unit (2 or more autism classes) established under approval of the National Council for Special Education, the Principal will be appointed on an administrative basis.The introduction of these measures will improve the capacity of the schools in question to cater for the educational needs of all their pupils and will assist their principals in their work.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.As part of my Department's ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders receive an education appropriate to their needs my Department has established:178 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools,5 special Classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome,16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum,14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis, 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.My Department provides significant additional funding for such special classes including a start-up grant of €6500 to cover the cost of furniture and general equipment; a further set-up grant of €635 to ensure suitable teaching materials are purchased for the class and schools may apply for funding for specialist equipment which may be required by individual pupils such as specialist desks or chairs.  In addition, I recently announced a thirty per cent increase in the rates of capitation paid to all children attending autism specific classes. This brings the enhanced rate of capitation payable to €805 per pupil per annum enrolled in a special class for autism. The school in question will qualify for additional capitation funding under this initiative.The Deputy will be aware that I have recently announced a new measure whereby the principal will be appointed in an administrative basis, if a school has a principal and four or five mainstream class teachers and also has a specialist autism unit catering for 12-18 pupils established under approval of the National Council for Special Education.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	656	The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. This is part of my overall plan to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes. These will include guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments. To effect these administrative and service improvements requires the introduction of a new statutory basis for the scheme to replace the existing arrangements which involve a mix of statutory and non-statutory administrative schemes. Accordingly, the Government has approved the drafting of a new Student Support Bill which will place all student support schemes on a statutory footing for the first time, including providing for the designation of an appropriate awarding authority and for the general basis on which grants will be awarded to eligible students. Work on the Bill is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in early 2007.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I take it the Deputy's question relates to fees for part-time students undertaking undergraduate courses at our higher education institutions funded by the State. The HEA estimates that abolishing fees for such courses would have an annual cost of €40m. The HEA Eurostudent Survey 2005 found that students who are availing of part-time studies tend to do so as part of their career development (some 69% are in studies closely related to their job) and/or with employer support. Around 33% of students paying course fees received financial support from their employer.  Tax relief is available for these costs.

I have not set Dr Port a deadline for the completion of his work as I want to ensure that he undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the submission from Waterford Institute of Technology taking account of the new developments for the sector since the passing of the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 and also the wider changing policy context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	663	An application for funding from the centre referred to by the Deputy has been received under the Fund for the Development of Educational Responses to Certain Children at Risk. As the Deputy is aware, this Fund is the responsibility of my colleague, Mr Brian Lenihan, T.D., Minister for Children and is administered by my Department. The initiative forms part of a multi-agency approach to meet the needs of children who are at risk, the objective of which is to develop preventative and supportive programmes, which are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. A key focus of the initiative is the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants.  Resources allocated under this initiative are used for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in education. The initiative is limited in the number of projects that can be funded.The Projects/Schools must demonstrate evidence of an assessment of existing actions in the local area and can demonstrate that the proposed initiative either compliments such actions or fills a gap in provision; be overseen by a steering committee, which represents relevant multi-agency statutory and voluntary bodies such as schools, parents, youth and community services, health, recreation and leisure groups and charitable organisations; and focus preventative and supportive actions on enhancing the retention and participation of the target group in education and training. Funding has been approved for the centre referred to by the Deputy and notification of this will be issued to the centre in the coming days.

The Building Section of my Department approved grant aid of €77,136.75 for roof works at the school. I understand that these works commenced last week.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	666	My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs including the needs of pupils with autism. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second level, approximately 1,854 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 534 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,365 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools. With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/ special needs.The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/ special needs. The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following: Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours; and Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs. My Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.In recent years, my Department has supported the establishment of a number of special classes for pupils with autism in mainstream post primary schools. The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education. Special classes are currently in operation in a number of post primary schools throughout the country and discussions are ongoing between the NCSE and a number of other post primary schools with a view to establishing further classes of this nature. The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made. In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	667	The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year. The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector. At present, there are no plans, to expand the provisions in the grant schemes in relation to postgraduate study abroad.However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by Section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000/01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	672	Demand for group sewerage scheme grants arises mainly from small village communities and clusters of houses situated close to towns/villages that have public sewerage facilities.  Unlike the abstraction, treatment and distribution of water by a group water scheme, group sewerage scheme activity is confined to the provision of significantly less costly collection systems and this is reflected in the relative values of the grants currently available. My Department is funding a pilot programme, proposed by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, to test a range of new, small-scale waste water collection and treatment systems under Irish conditions.  The objective of the pilot programme is to evaluate new approaches to meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of rural communities and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending collection systems to households outside the catchment of new or existing sewerage schemes. Construction of the pilot projects is currently underway and monitoring of the performance of the new infrastructure by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee will commence immediately after commissioning takes place.  I have asked the Committee to report on the results as they become available. I intend to review the grants for group sewerage schemes in light of the outcome of the pilot programme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	673	I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.My Department has already informed planning authorities that they should not attach planning conditions relating to management companies in the case of traditional housing estates, unless in very specific exceptional circumstances, e.g. holiday home developments, or to maintain a specific private shared facility.  My Department has set up a Working Group on Management Companies/Taking in Charge of Estates which is considering the question of responsibility for the maintenance of common shared facilities (roads, sewerage, footpaths, public lighting, large open spaces, smaller landscaped open spaces, car-parking, etc) in residential estates, including the newer type of mixed high-density estate.  It is intended to issue guidance to planning authorities based on the outcome of the Group's work, by early 2007.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.Property management companies are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the provisions of company law.  Obligations on property owners in relation to management companies, for example in relation to membership of and payment of charges to management companies, arise from private contracts entered into by them through the conveyancing process in the purchase of the property. My Department has no function in relation to the operation of property management companies or dealings between particular management companies and residents. Accordingly information on these particular issues would not be available to my Department.I understand that Fingal County Council is maintaining public lighting in the area in question and arranging for the taking in charge of other appropriate public facilities and that it is also engaging with residents in relation to the taking in charge process.  The legality of any matter or the validity of any contract would ultimately be subject to determination by the Courts and it would not be appropriate for me to express any view on such matters.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	676	I refer to the reply to Question No. 438 of 22 November 2006.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I refer to the reply to Question No. 440 of 22 November 2006.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I am advised that local authorities do not have the statutory power to provide a subsidy to private waste collectors to fund the operation of a waiver scheme in areas where the authority is not itself the service provider. However, in such areas, certain local authorities have, within the powers available to them, made arrangements to have waste collected from specific households.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	679	My Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their approved current expenditure on the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Much of this expenditure is operationalised through projects managed by voluntary bodies. My Department has not to date received specific proposals from any of the local authorities in the South East for funding of services for homeless persons to be provided by South East Simon.In October 2006, my Department gave approval in principle to Kilkenny County Council for the funding of an Outreach/Tenancy Sustainment Service for homeless persons in Kilkenny City and County. It is understood that Kilkenny County Council will go to tender shortly to seek a service provider for this proposed service. In addition, my Department is aware that Waterford City Council also has plans to develop homeless outreach services and is likely to go to tender for the development of such a service in early 2007. It would, of course, be open to South East Simon to tender for the provision of these or other planned services of local authorities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	680	All development requires planning permission unless specifically exempted under the Planning and Development Acts and Regulations.  Section 4(1)(h) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, provides that development consisting of the carrying out of works for the maintenance, improvement or other alteration of any structure is exempted development if the works affect only the interior of the structure or do not materially affect the external appearance of the structure so as to render the appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures.  The erection of one dish type antenna used for the receiving and transmitting of signals from satellites on, or within the curtilage of a house is specifically exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to conditions, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Class 4 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001. The conditions include that no such antenna shall be erected on, or forward of, the front wall of the house.On 5 November, I announced the publication of a consultation paper containing proposals to revise the exempted development regulations to ensure that they support the use of renewable energy for domestic users, for example to permit the installation of small wind turbines or solar panels without planning permission in certain circumstances.  My Department is currently considering the submissions received during the consultation period and I expect to submit draft exempted development regulations to the Oireachtas shortly:  these would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.
